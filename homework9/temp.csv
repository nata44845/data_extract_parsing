Alias Grace,1,"Polley has captured the novel's essential strangeness and also applied rigour to the world of a 19th-century drudge. When you watch Sarah Gadon's Grace knead dough, you see the perspiration on her brow, the rawness of her over-worked hands."

Shining Girls,1,"The dark and grim Shining Girls has moments that are hard to stomach – you may also have filled your quota on violence perpetrated against female characters – but the plotting, performances and vibe are crafted so well, it is compelling to watch."

The Boys,1,"In a show packed with gratuitous violence, some of the deepest cuts are emotional."
Ramy,1,"Well-drawn supporting characters with sharp tongues help lighten the mood, and Hiam Abbass is hilarious as Ramy's daggy mother."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"It tends to resemble a random grab-bag of American and Japanese TV icons, tossed into a blender that's set on puree. But it's fast, frantic, and very funny, the animation is top-notch, and ""Lupin"" fans at least will find the characters warmly familiar."
