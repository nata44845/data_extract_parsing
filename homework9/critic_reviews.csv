Show,Sentiment,Review
Mare of Easttown,1,I’m not sure I have engaged in appointment viewing in years! It was nice to be giddy on a Sunday night for m’stories.
Mare of Easttown,1,Kate is marvelous; she truly is Mare. She disappears into this role!
Mare of Easttown,1,"That’s the thing I’ve loved most about Mare: the general feeling of excitement and, dare I say, fandom..."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Boasting Kate Winslet in the title role, twisty plotlines, and breakneck pacing, the series earned fans aplenty over the course of its seven-episode run."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Performances in which madness, psychopathy or extreme pathos prevails usually are the ones who are most acclaimed. However, Winslet manages to give depth and authenticity to a much more mundane, but usually more banally represented feeling: tiredness."
Mare of Easttown,1,Kate Winslet delivered one of the performances of the year. ... What made it more than a cop show was its exploration of grief and trauma.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Exploring the dark side of a community, like Broadchurch, it was not only mystifying, bewildering, and perplexing, it became addictive."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Full of drama, tragedy and unease, but with a hint of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
Mare of Easttown,1,Anyone with a taste for HBO's knockout prestige-plus-murder combo should find out what both Mare and Easttown have to hide.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is particularly effective in interweaving troubled domestic timelines, families held together by women who are on the brink of psychic or emotional collapse."
Mare of Easttown,1,Ingelsby's unflinching study of character and Winslet's immaculate acting come together to achieve a kind of devastating perfection.
Mare of Easttown,1,"All of this rich backstory and careful character detail significantly enhances the girl-murdered-in-a-small-town TV series template, already well explored by Sharp Objects and Top of the Lake."
Mare of Easttown,1,"While the pacing of ""Mare"" is a little jarring out of the gate, it's ultimately what makes the show stand out from the rest of its ilk. It's as equally interested in the people on screen as it is in the gruesome fate that befalls one of them."
Mare of Easttown,1,"What makes it worth seeing are the little things in the margins, and the scenes that burrow into Mare's daily life and lingering grief."
Mare of Easttown,1,"If you can get past the melancholy and conventional plot, though, the series is thoroughly engaging."
Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare"" isn't just a Winslet acting exhibition, nor is it ever in danger of becoming a hollow A-list actor offensive... It's a riveting and messy family drama that's wrapped in a chewy and thrilling murder mystery."
Mare of Easttown,1,Kate Winslet's first television series in a decade simply leaves you wondering why she hasn't done more.
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's Winslet, an actress that stands tall with the greatest ever, who triumphs in Mare of Easttown... Mare may just be one of her most memorable creations yet."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Through honesty, vulnerability, and connection with others, Winslet brings to life a character beginning the work of processing repressed trauma."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's the perfect show for anyone who loved to bathe in the unsparing pain of shows like Broadchurch and Sharp Objects, and it will no doubt be equally awarded during this year's Emmy telecast."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Verisimilitude on its own can seem clinical; in Mare of Easttown, it is counterbalanced with a finely tuned emotional realism, as if the series' relationships had been buffed until they felt sufficiently timeworn as well."
Mare of Easttown,1,"You'll care deeply for these people and the town, and you'll be on the edge of your seat clinging to the hope that Mare can and will make a difference, setting things right for everyone."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Like any other thriller, the incredible Kate Winslet makes sure you are on the edge of the seat at the end of every single episode."
Mare of Easttown,1,The challenge facing cop television now is the challenge to depict a desire for greater accountability in a profession notoriously hostile to it. Mare of Easttown doesn't face that challenge because its protagonist is consumed by accountability.
Mare of Easttown,1,"This is part of an emerging trend of series and films reflecting the rural poverty...this time in the dead-girl-in-the-woods detective sub-genre, boosted by a hypnotically intense, Emmy-winning Kate Winslet performance."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Underneath the red herrings and unexpected twists, Mare of Easttown is a show about the threats and dangers of motherhood for Mare and for all the women of her generation in their small, working-class town."
Mare of Easttown,1,"While nobody will turn to the show for light relief, they might well turn to it for other reasons: the increasingly effective slow-burn plotting, the convincing nature of that small-town bleakness and, above all, Winslet's performance."
Mare of Easttown,1,"...a top-notch cop show, and an easy recommend for anyone who enjoys an old-school whodunit..."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Grumpy, bullish and beaten down after years of tragedy, Sheehan is one of Winslet's bleakest characters yet. She's also one of her best."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The white working class is depicted fairly, neither spitefully nor satirically. There is, in short, no Chetwyndian ""real enemy"" pulling strings behind the curtain, no groaner of a sociopolitical point being made. It's just a potboiler. Refreshing!"
Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare of Easttown"" is a riveting and compelling series. With Winslet at the top of her game, this is a show you don't want to miss."
Mare of Easttown,1,Mare of Easttown won with the old television scheme. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mare of Easttown,1,"It constantly surprises and overwhelms you, but all within a homogeneous narrative that remains honest and consistent with itself and with its viewers. [Full review in Spanish]"
Mare of Easttown,1,The willful griminess and funk of the first episode might turn you off but stick with the show as Mare investigates the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of two others.
Mare of Easttown,1,"It has become a hipster's Line of Duty, shunning the over-the-top dramatics in favour of grit, decay and the sheer misery of small town detective work."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It was a slice of perfection, a love letter to post-industrial Pennsylvania, face ground into the gutter and not even daring to look at the stars."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The show is steeped in the classic hard-boiled world of good old-fashioned policing. But it is the characters we care about, even though they appear deficient when displaying emotion."
Mare of Easttown,1,Just seven episodes have been necessary to hook us with a case full of surprises and a town with a multitude of inhabitants to remember. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mare of Easttown,1,"A riveting piece of fiction, with its non-stop spate of red herrings, well-timed pockets of intrigue, and a whole array of dodgy suspects."
Mare of Easttown,1,"That rare, confident series which jumps off the screen, fully formed."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The real TV event of the week, as with last week and certainly with next week, is Mare of Easttown."
Mare of Easttown,1,"As Mare, Kate Winslet crackles in a role we haven't seen from her in her decades long career."
Mare of Easttown,1,Mare of Easttown is a compelling show. It dives into these characters in a way that feels engaging and satisfying.
Mare of Easttown,1,"While the pacing is spotty, and the end is predictable, the twists and turns throughout will keep viewers guessing."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The miniseries doesn't simply adopt the grammar of the classic mystery, it constructs a warped, crumbling universe around it instead."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The success of the series is due in large part to Kate Winslet, who gives us a sublime performance. [Full review in Spanish]"
Mare of Easttown,1,"The mystery of who killed Erin McMenamin gave the show its plot, but over the course of seven episodes, it became clear that the series was most interested in exploring the contradictions and conundrums of motherhood."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown worked because of everything it wasn't: it wasn't a glossy book to TV adaptation, aka Big Little Lies, and it wasn't wig and coat acting, aka The Undoing. It was rooted firmly in the believably domestic."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The show is equally drab and riveting, claustrophobic and caustic."
Mare of Easttown,1,"With her regional accent prominent, [Kate Winslet] invests one of her rare television performances with such a vivid interior life that Mare's watchfulness and intractability have a telling openness."
Mare of Easttown,1,"I like almost everything about this hero, from the nuanced and thoroughly engaging performance of Kate Winslet to the sociology of gender, social class, family, small-town policing and sports that is richly explored through this troubled character."
Mare of Easttown,1,"HBO's latest prestige crime procedural, Mare of Easttown, scratches the itch for gritty, well-produced drama, neatly filling the hole left by other offerings like True Detective but with a much-needed tweak."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown explores the repression of the American male of a certain class and race, with little fetishizing."
Mare of Easttown,1,"HBO's Mare of Easttown is constructed around a familiar, virtually surefire plot: a shocking crime in a small town leads to an investigation that ultimately reveals every major local scandal in an astoundingly errant community. And it works."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet may be the star, but it's the ensemble here that makes her new murder mystery series stand out from those that are pure logic puzzles or that focus strictly on killers or detectives."
Mare of Easttown,1,"On the Granger Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Mare of Easttown"" is an intriguing 8."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown might be confined by its played-out genre, but it also provides new turns on a familiar song."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The plot gets going and Winslet makes the most of a role that in lesser hands could be a collection of tropes (in episode two, grouchy Mare is paired with a hotshot young detective brought in from out-of-town)."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare Of Easttown is, more than anything else, a tour de force for its star, Kate Winslet, who owns this series, top to bottom."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Every good murder mystery must feature a range of viable suspects, and Mare of Easttown does a great job of establishing a handful of red herrings both expected and not."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is utterly mesmeric, shorn of any glamour, make-up-free and permanently sour-faced, dressed in a shapeless lumberjack shirt that does her no favours at all and looks as if it needs a boil wash."
Mare of Easttown,1,"As the twists and turns of the cases are revealed, it becomes a show greater than the sum of its already considerable parts"
Mare of Easttown,1,"It is a performance that will undoubtedly get [Kate Winslet] awards season recognition next year, a circuit that is familiar ground for her. But great work never gets old."
Mare of Easttown,1,"For a work about a neglected corner of America, there's none of the sneering critique of Hillbilly Elegy or the ludicrous rivalries of Ozark. Instead, Mare of Easttown is just a subtle, textured portrait of a place where some people are suffering."
Mare of Easttown,1,"I like Winslet's performance. Its fearlessness might be predictable -- doesn't every actor long to look this bad, while sounding this good? -- but her pugnacious attention to detail makes it very enjoyable to watch."
Mare of Easttown,1,"With all the elements of a great mystery, led by a talented force, the series has everything needed to grip audiences and become our next tv obsession."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Its star will get most of the attention, but it is well acted throughout."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet undergoes one of her best transformations on screen since playing the frustrated suburban wife in ""Revolutionary Road."""
Mare of Easttown,1,"Without Winslet, Mare of Easttown's first episode is just another entry in a long list of high-profile crime dramas. Winslet makes it a compelling character study that I'm looking forward to unpacking over the next 6 weeks."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown wallows, but it takes its wallowing seriously. It's a cunningly crafted mystery series, anchored by an awesome Kate Winslet performance, that manages to evade most cliches."
Mare of Easttown,1,"We've probably seen enough of this particular type of story that we can't get truly excited over these conventions anymore, but Mare of Easttown's direction is sharp, its writing is observant, and its star is giving yet another fantastic performance."
Mare of Easttown,1,"New from HBO, Mare of Easttown is a fine addition to this lineage, thanks to a superb and surprising lead performance from Kate Winslet and excellent work from the show's writer and creator Brad Ingelsby."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is clearly the workhorse of this production. In Mare Sheehan, she has found an ideal vessel to channel every trick she has."
Mare of Easttown,1,"In its rock-solid sense of place, though, Mare of Easttown sticks to at least one infallible rule: Inglesby is clearly writing what he knows..."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Ingelsby has crafted a terrific character study that's even better as a slow-burning thriller, with the tone of a moody British mystery transplanted to the Northeast."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is designed to be a limited series, so the self-contained aspect helps heighten both the character development and mystery-driven aspects of the series."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's both moody and atmospheric like the slow-burning Top of the Lake or True Detective, while being as propulsive as a Dan Brown paperback. By taking the best elements of both and dumping the rest, Mare of Easttown is unstoppable."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The way Kate Winslet realizes Detective Mare Sheehan persuades you to stick with it past its glum first hour. If you manage to do this, the show just might grow on you."
Mare of Easttown,1,Has the makings of a great HBO mystery series.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
Loot,1,"Ultimately, Loot is a fine show, and given the dearth of light, half-hour comedies, it’s a welcome one... Given the talent in front of the camera, as well as behind it, it’s still disappointing that there is this much talent behind so little depth."
Loot,1,The magnetism Maya Rudolph transmits is sufficient motive to stay attentive to this series.   [Full review in Spanish]
Loot,0,The greatest crime of Loot is how much it fails its leading lady.
Loot,1,"While certainly imperfect and the beginning not always smooth, Loot is a comedy with tremendous promise that deserves a chance to earn return viewership."
Loot,1,"It takes Rudolph's adaptability, her willingness to play the joke and also unpack it, her presence, and her charm to anchor the show's parody and empathy in tandem."
Loot,1,"'Loot' feels like a missed opportunity, as it burns through precious screen time establishing aesthetics, rather than focusing on character creation. Leaving a supremely strong cast to deliver depth, while story falls by the way side."
Loot,1,"Loot is a very watchable, and funny-enough show. But we just want a Maya Rudolph series to really make its star a tour de force"
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
Loot,0,"The Apple TV+ series has a concept and a star that practically commands you to pay attention, but the show fails to build on its foundation and is an imperfect showcase for Rudolph’s talents."
Loot,1,Loot is yet another project unworthy of the former SNL star’s considerable talents.
Loot,1,Loot has real potential to be something special.
Loot,1,Maya Rudolph is priceless in Loot.
Loot,1,"Loot sounds like a one-note joke on paper... Stick with it, though, and this showcase for Maya Rudolph as a billionaire minted through divorce becomes a sweet if fairly conventional romantic comedy with a few welcome surprises."
Loot,1,"Philanthropy as a whim? It’s funny enough, and it gives Rudolph plenty of room to play grandiose while simultaneously making fun of filthy rich people’s lives."
Loot,0,"It’s only thanks to Rudolph’s ability to balance winsomeness, befuddlement, and sincerity that Molly isn’t utterly infuriating, and even with that in mind, Loot overestimates how much of the character viewers will be willing to tolerate."
Loot,1,Maya Rudolph makes being mega-rich look fabulous as a benevolent but clueless billionaire trying to do good on 'Loot.'
Loot,1,"Hilarious scenarios of work and play, growing comradeship, and Molly’s gradual recognition of who she really is, and dropping the artifice of her former life make for a charming, engaging three hours."
Loot,1,"The cast holds its own and makes Loot an easy watch, with the season finale perfectly setting up what could potentially be a far more uncompromising future of the show."
Loot,1,Is it a bit preachy? Kind of. Does it hedge its bets? Often. But by the end of the series it has done enough to make you care about its characters.
Loot,1,"It’s a breezy, gag-filled comedy with just enough absurdity to satisfy."
Loot,1,Loot feels like two polar opposite shows grafted into one awkward enterprise that doesn’t fit. What exists is a sitcom that’s far below the talents of everyone involved. It’s not bad; it’s just a show with a hefty production budget but no depth.
Loot,1,Makes you fall in love with their flawed characters.
Loot,1,"Its ethical journey finally delivers a pretty solid pay-off, but I can’t help feeling it would have been more persuasive had it delivered a few more gags along the way."
Loot,0,"The talented cast, glossy production sheen, and pop culture savvy jokes make the ten 30-minute episodes an easy watch. Unfortunately, Loot can’t stop the glimmer from fading."
Loot,1,Rodriguez brings the same heartfelt emotion to Sofia that made her the most likable character on FX’s Pose and her chemistry with Rudolph proves magnetic. It’s the most unexpected but welcome odd-couple pairing of the summer TV season so far.
Loot,1,"Comedy shows have gotten a little dark of late,with bleak scenarios or introspective sad-com direction replacing belly laughs. However,Alan Yang & Matt Hubbard have crafted a charming venture that effectively utilizes its strong ensemble to maximum impact"
Loot,1,"The further the show goes on, the richer Molly, her support ensemble and her story seem to get."
Loot,0,"Though Loot has a more-than-capable lead performer and a talented ensemble surrounding her, this Apple TV+ comedy digs a narrative hole for itself that it takes an entire season to climb out of."
Loot,1,"On paper, Loot, the new AppleTV+ comedy series, sounds like a sure-fire home run. Unfortunately, after watching the ten-episode first season of the series, this isn’t the home run I was hoping for – just a solid double."
Loot,1,"Bubbly and beautiful to look at, the Apple TV+ series from Matt Hubbard and Alan Yang gets a gratifying boost from its eccentric ensemble cast."
Loot,1,"With a stellar cast, Loot is electrically hilarious. It’s fun, introspective, and hits all the right notes. The series manages to take the workplace comedy, twist it, and come out the other side with something unique..."
Loot,1,"There's a lot to enjoy about Loot, starting with its timely narrative and solid showcase for some of Maya Rudolph's myriad skills. At the same time, it's very much a show you'll keep watching more for its potential than its immediate execution."
Loot,1,"Loot is a pleasant enough viewing experience, with a few sharp one-liners and a truly top-notch cast. But it’s also slightly disappointing, hampered by repetitive plot dynamics and a confused tone."
Loot,0,"Because [Rudolph] can do almost anything, a temptation exists to create roles that allow her to do everything. And that can result in a tonal jumble like Loot, which feels like a lot of great raw material in search of a series to make sense of it all."
Loot,1,Loot is most often a pleasantly frictionless workplace comedy. But the moments in which it’s not are the show’s most compelling by a long shot.
Loot,1,"A Funny, Surprising Series With A Great Lead Role For Maya Rudolph."
Loot,1,They each serve a purpose that allows dimension for Molly when she’s still operating on only two. It’s oddly refreshing.
Loot,1,"Rudolph understands this character, her struggles and her high-points, and brings her usual charm and hilarity to the role."
Loot,1,Loot is a heartfelt Ted Lasso meets The Office-style comedy complete with various layers of odd-couple dynamics that most certainly do not disappoint.
Loot,1,"The supporting cast is terrific, though my eyes were constantly on Maya Rudolph. ... Her presence and performance galvanizes the consistently funny and insightful series."
Loot,0,"Not every show about the ultra-wealthy needs to be as biting as Succession, but Loot too often comes off as entirely toothless."
Loot,1,"Rudolph's character could use a little more comeuppance to make the series work even better, but it's a strong start to a show that balances silly and serious."
For All Mankind,1,"There are high highs, but low lows. Overall however, this is the best season yet."
For All Mankind,1,"Three seasons in, For All Mankind makes a compelling case for its existence in the vast television landscape. [...] The epic scope of space travel and exploration plays perfectly off of the intimate relationship between these complicated characters."
For All Mankind,1,"Three seasons deep and For All Mankind is as reliably good as ever and a perfect showcase for the mature, well-formed storytelling that has informed much of Apple TV+'s original programming."
For All Mankind,1,One of the best series on television returns with a blow-out premiere and an excellent season to come.
For All Mankind,1,"[The premiere] still has time for a high-stakes Poseidon Adventure-style crisis that’s genuinely tense, emotional, and fully grounded in the things that have come before."
For All Mankind,1,"The characters are richly drawn, and we are able to invest in them over their lifetimes (some of which are longer than others). If you liked Gravity, this is like that, only with characters we've gotten to know and (mostly) love over three seasons."
For All Mankind,1,"“For All Mankind” is a mission worth continuing, with speculations about the past and future that also make it a wonderful stimulant for the imagination."
For All Mankind,1,"… the best kind of cinematic television. It looks, feels, and moves like a movie, and the writing, acting and production is some of the best on the small screen.”"
For All Mankind,1,"Around every corner, For All Mankind finds fraught geopolitical and interpersonal dynamics."
For All Mankind,1,The space race sets its sight on Mars in the thrilling third season of the fascinating alt-history drama.
For All Mankind,1,"One of the best Sci-Fi premises that we can enjoy year after year, even though it sometimes stumbles trying to be more melodramatic than it should.  [Full review in Spanish]"
For All Mankind,1,"The third season of the alt-history series reinforces that 'For All Mankind' is not just an entertaining drama, but a truly great one..."
For All Mankind,1,"If you have been on board already, season three proves as addictive as season two, albeit slightly more heightened because the technology of this timeline’s 1990s is advanced beyond space-faring technology then or now."
For All Mankind,1,Much of For All Mankind’s third season retains the show’s best qualities.
For All Mankind,1,"If you liked the first two seasons, the third keeps up the momentum."
For All Mankind,1,"After two seasons of relative obscurity, maybe it is time an unheralded masterpiece finally achieves blast-off."
For All Mankind,1,"In the endless barrage of mediocre series pushed out weekly, ""Mankind"" stands out, a shining star (or moon or planet) among the replaceable rest."
For All Mankind,1,"Old and new rivalries add to the tension, and For All Mankind’s ambitious journey into the ‘90s is incredibly satisfying."
For All Mankind,1,"Always an engaging, entertaining, and often bizarre glimpse into the multiverse of possible roads not travelled in recent history."
For All Mankind,1,"The action remains as relentlessly heart-pounding as ever, and it's made all the more potent by the care the show takes to build intimate connections between characters."
For All Mankind,1,For All Mankind remains competence porn of the highest order -- and the best show you’re probably not watching.
For All Mankind,1,"At its best -- which it still so often is -- For All Mankind is able to present so many different, exciting movies at the same time that the missteps stick out more than they would on a series not trying to do as much, let alone as widely capable."
For All Mankind,1,"As a combination of wish fulfillment bolstered by good writing, superb direction, and sterling performances, For All Mankind continues to soar."
For All Mankind,1,"Effective in its quiet moments and in the sequences where catastrophe strikes, For All Mankind still struggles with that middle ground."
For All Mankind,1,"The power of For All Mankind is that it makes space both unreachable and attainable simultaneously. It’s a serious and gritty show, but through all of that darkness and real-world drama, there’s genuine excitement."
For All Mankind,1,"It seamlessly balances science fiction and period drama, understated storytelling and pulpy soap opera beats. I have screamed watching For All Mankind. I have howled in laughter. I have leapt up out of my chair and paced around the room."
For All Mankind,1,"This is a completely competent, well-made season of television with some stellar performances and good story arcs. But it’s just not up to the high level I was hoping the series would maintain moving forward."
Severance,1,"Not so fond of the corporate treadmill? As it immerses, engages and intrigues, Severance truly understands."
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Severance,1,"It's a marvelous irony that this allegory to technocratic messianism is being produced and broadcasted by the same company that subbed out the holy cross for a bitten apple, and God, for Steve Jobs. [Full review in Spanish]"
Severance,1,"Black Mirror meets Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in a gender bender series with incredible aesthetics and a captivating story that borrows Sci Fi elements to tackle memories, affection, boredom, work routine and corporative bureaucracy."
Severance,1,"A combination of a psychological thriller, and dark comedy, amid a treasure trove of science-fiction components; Severance is a mind-bending delight. One of the year's best new series."
Severance,1,"A work of terrific imagination and confidence: THX-1138, Brazil, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying swirled together into a deranged sweet-and-savory concoction."
Severance,1,Incredibly thought-provoking on the nature of consciousness and the dangers of the dis-integrated self.
Severance,1,"Stiller, who directed six of the show’s nine episodes, is emerging as a preëminent television auteur."
Severance,1,"It feels like watching a master magician work your expectations and misdirect you flawlessly, only to reveal something so unexpected that it makes you briefly question the nature of reality."
Severance,1,Was that one of the best season finales… ever?
Severance,1,"Severances ingenious premise, stellar production values, and top-shelf performances make it a workplace show youll want to punch in for."
Severance,1,"With Severance, Apple has the best new show on television, an addictive, dark comedydrama that delivers a fascinating, weird, and haunting deep dive into our psyche that makes us beg for more."
Severance,1,"At once minimalist and epic, an increasingly tense exploration of free-will and corporate sadism. It gains a thriller-like momentum as it moves along, and can be disturbing enough to be nightmarish, yet still maintains a modicum of mischievous wit."
Severance,1,"""Intelligent and intriguing. Intelligent and intriguing. We imagine the hell and we created it.""  Full Review in Spanish -Letras Libres"
Severance,1,"This show has it all: murder, mystery, intrigue, love, and twists and turns--many of which you never see coming and those that you do, you sit on the edge of your seat attempting to will it to happen or not-- and at the core of it all is power & greed."
Severance,1,It combines the paranoia of a '70s thriller with the dehumanizing vastness of Stanley Kubrick's visionary stories of characters becoming overwhelmed by the environmental forces engulfing them.
Severance,1,"I’m enjoying the ride — or at least, I began to once I pushed through the first couple of hours that set up the premise."
Severance,1,"The show’s otherworldly, Kaufmanesque aesthetic, from Jeremy Hindle’s corporately brutal production design to Theodore Shapiro’s eerie score, belies a great humanity."
Severance,1,"As tooth-grindingly painful as it would be to not uncover every facet of this unsettling mystery over the coming weeks, I’m invested enough in this dark satire to have patience to see out Erickson’s long-term vision, even if it means more work for us."
Severance,1,"Severance is one part office drama and two parts character study, with dashes of psychological thriller thrown in. As a premise, it takes the idea of workplace politics and chops them into chunks, before turning that into a frappe."
Severance,1,It's probably one of the best shows that's been put on AppleTV+ since Ted Lasso.
Severance,1,"Giving a whole new meaning to the term work life balance, season one explores a unique take on the thriller genre. A bit of a slow burn right from the very start, but eventually picks up the pace about halfway through."
Severance,1,"Ben Stiller’s excellent new limited series, Severance, turns the corporate workplace into the setting for a new and timely subgenre: “job horror.”"
Severance,1,"While the pace of the show is definitely slow, the building tension only contributes to it's eerie, antiseptic tone. The underlying dark humor is also delightful."
Severance,1,"Severance is many things: a workplace satire, a mystery box show, a meditation on memory and grief. But its most poignant commentary is in how the show artfully captures the experience of working while the world burns around you."
Severance,1,Severance is about much more than satire.
Severance,1,"I can forgive Severance a lot because it’s easily the most fun of the metaphysical, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality mystery-box shows that have popped up over the past few years."
Severance,1,Stiller is doing some of his best work yet directing these TV projects. Adam Scott is terrific here.
Severance,1,"A meditative, existential buzzkill. Moments of humor exist, but they are quickly quashed. The show is expertly crafted, mind you. Every shot is deliberate, crisp, and polished. It knows exactly what it wants to be, esthetically."
Severance,1,"It explores who we really are, a spiraling absurdist Twilight Zone...the space is probed and drives the narrative forward."
Severance,1,"Under its genre thrills, Severance contains a poignant message — forgetting may be a convenience, but remembering is a luxury."
Severance,1,"“Severance” has much to say about the idea of slaving away at an office, but it balances work and play very well with the way it teases us into deciphering its puzzles."
Severance,1,"It’s hardly the first satirical take on office life but slick direction and an endlessly compelling, frequently weird premise make Severance worth calling in sick for."
Severance,1,"The premise is unique and its refreshing to see something so different on screen. That being said, you have to be willing to open your mind to not knowing whats going to happen next."
Severance,1,"Artfully framed, spookily scored, and acted with deadpan wit."
Severance,1,"Severance takes an unsettling deep dive into the question of can we really separate work from life? It's eerie to the max and the mystery builds to a brilliant crescendo. The performances, design, and score all amplify the clever story. We want more."
Severance,1,"If you’re looking for an enthralling new mystery with a distinct visual style to dive into, Severance is a must-watch show."
Severance,1,"The show goes to some bleak places, but with each twist -- of the show, or its philosophical knife -- it’s also increasingly compelling."
Severance,1,"As high concept television goes, Severance is pretty lofty, but its ambition is compelling -- not least because it might just be the bulls--- jobs backlash we’ve been waiting for."
Severance,1,"The real joy (and horror) of Severance is in its constantly expanding mythos, each episode offering a new puzzle piece, these new bits of knowledge perfectly doled out, that allows for a broader understanding of the whole."
Severance,1,Severance becomes the best kind of TV surprise: one that rewards early patience with a real knockout of a back half.
Severance,1,The chilling two-episode premiere uses a clever premise and excellent cast to set up an intriguing mystery that leaves plenty of room for the characters to evolve.
Severance,1,"At first blush, the titular concept of the new Apple TV+ series is “work-life balance” taken to the extreme. Yet the further ‘Severance’ goes, the more resonance it acquires."
Severance,1,"It’s all a little heady, but delivered with a hefty amount of style to help the world building go down. Most of the series is directed by Ben Stiller, and imbued with a quiet, odd-ball humor."
Severance,1,"You will never think of work-life balance the same way EVER, seeing the first episodes of this eerie psychological sci fi drama."
Severance,1,"Not just one of TVs best sci-fi satires, but an all-timer in both genres for any medium. Let’s just say George Orwell and Mike Judd would both love this new Apple+ series."
Severance,1,"It's a crackerjack premise brought to life by a uniformly excellent ensemble, and those are reasons enough to watch this corker of a series."
Severance,1,"Severance is classic slow-burn TV, lulling you with its hypnotic weirdness before piling on the twists."
Severance,1,Benefits from rich world-building and droll humor about office perks and morale.
Severance,1,"Expertly acted and absorbing (if not especially fast paced), Severance is so calibrated to current-day anxieties that I couldn’t stop watching it."
Severance,1,"The lure of 'Severance' is watching actors I enjoy figuring out how to fight their way out of a paper box that grows more mysterious, and possibly even completely inscrutable, as time passes."
Severance,1,"'Severance' is smart and stylish television, though it may suffer from a certain amount of impenetrability."
Severance,1,"Walking a fine line between absurdist satire and suspense, Severance feels like a workplace comedy by George Orwell."
Severance,1,Severance is a strikingly thoughtful meditation on the way that work functions as a prison.
Severance,1,"Severance is a visually fascinating work of art, an enthralling mystery, and an anticapitalist takedown of toxic labor practices; it's the first must-watch Apple TV+ show of the year."
Severance,1,"Severance is part workplace satire, part dystopian thriller – a combination that is hard to pull off, but writer Dan Erickson has managed it."
Severance,1,"An impressively idiosyncratic thing, wholly itself and confident in its mission to make your mind implode."
Severance,1,Really spooky fabulous.
Severance,1,"If Hell was a Staples breakroom, it's exactly what Severance would try to get you out of. It's a must-watch."
Severance,0,"The season finale is genuinely exciting and suspenseful, but, really, even as an advocate of slow television, we might have got there in half the time with twice the effect."
Severance,1,"A very stimulating head trip of a social sci-fi that’s willing to plumb its poignant premise for as much eerie intrigue as possible, and I’d highly recommend jumping on board."
Severance,1,"Confidently written, stylishly directed... every well-paced episode fits into the overall puzzle, character arcs are thoughtfully conceived, and the oddities and eccentricities of the central mystery are given space to unfurl."
Severance,1,"Lock yourself in with this one. It’s got something. And if Apple TV cancels Severance after one season, we riot."
Severance,1,"If Severance is renewed for a second season, it should have ample room to explore those rich topics. In the meantime, as we ponder its big ideas, it’s our investment in the characters that should keep viewers in the show’s orbit."
Severance,1,"The new Apple TV+ sci-fi series is brilliantly unsettling, with captivating lead performances by Adam Scott and Patricia Arquette and a maze-like workplace set design that screams “NO EXIT.”"
Severance,1,"Severence will feel familiar, even if you cant rattle off a list of influences and contemporaries, but that's never a problem  Severance is very much a case of if you cant be the first, then be the best in action."
Severance,1,"Written and created by Dan Erickson with episodes directed by Ben Stiller, there’s a dark humor, absurdist vibe that, alongside the mysteries, makes Severance appealing. But some of that interest gets undone by over-long episodes and a thudding pace."
Severance,1,"I can report that Severance does not suck, though it takes about an episode and change to eventually transcend what had seemed like hard limits on viewer engagement."
Severance,1,"Light escapism it isn't. But until the show's fictional technology becomes reality, a series like Severance is just the sort of cerebral concept to help take one's mind off the daily grind of working 9 to 5."
Severance,1,"""Severance"" couldn't be more different from [Stiller's] last directorial success, the glum drama ""Escape at Dannemora."" But it's just as provocative."
Severance,1,"Funny, terrifying, and brilliant in equal measure, Apple TV+s Severance is one of the most impressive new shows of the last couple years."
Severance,1,"Creator Dan Erickson whips up something unique, intriguing and alarming; one of the first great series of 2022. Don’t miss it."
Severance,1,"For me, the world of this series is so fully imagined, so refreshingly singular — plus it just keeps on getting weirder — that I was only too happy to strap in, and was grateful I did."
Severance,1,"Even with all the ingredients of cast and crew, it would be so easy to bungle a show this tricky and high-concept. But “Severance” succeeds with a structure that works both as a weekend binge as well as one that can be enjoyed in weekly installments."
Severance,1,"Thought-provoking, thrilling, and impeccably well made, Severance is a remarkable achievement in long-form storytelling; a show so good that it reminded me of what I felt after watching Inception for the first time."
Severance,1,"A tone-blending speculative series in which nearly every element is all too relatable, whether that makes it funny or sad or straight-up horrifying."
Severance,1,"It moves so slowly that many viewers might be tempted to sever the relationship long before the end. I’d urge them to hang in there. The rewards do come, eventually, and they’re enough not only to justify staying to the end."
Severance,1,The way the show explores its core conceit with such detail and seriousness has helped it get off to a great start -- and made me realize that I should probably clock out on time more often.
Severance,1,"Compulsive on an episode-to-episode basis and unshakeable in between sittings, there are so many ideas swirling, so many pieces moving, it would be easy to overlook the immense lift needed to give the show its clarity."
Severance,1,"Although Severance impressively mixes thriller with horror and sci-fi, it never runs too far from the truth about everyones work/life balance. This show will make you reconsider how much of yourself and your personality youve given to a business."
Severance,0,Ben Stiller's horror series Severance asks interesting questions but gets lost in giving the answers.
Severance,1,The cast is absolutely cracker jack  and reason alone to watch the series  but combine that with the thrilling twists and narrative turns? This is a heck of a series.
Severance,1,Severance isn’t just one of the most tonally honest versions of office life; it’s an entirely new genre of corporate horror that’s a force unto itself.
Severance,1,"“Severance” spins its wheels some as it fleshes out the details of its world. But the payoff is considerable, and by the time the first season ends, it’s clear the series is playing a long game."
Severance,1,My only complaint is that I never wanted it to end.
Severance,1,"Surprising, invigorating, and thoughtfully designed, Severance is well worth the time investment."
Severance,1,"It’s an innovative premise that raises phenomenological, existential and ethical quandaries even in synopsis form."
Severance,1,The best way to describe... Severance is to imagine if Yargos Lanthimos were to helm an episode of Black Mirror in the style of The Office. This could well be one of the best shows of the year.
Severance,1,"With smart performances, an intriguing script, and buckets of style from Ben Stiller in pure thriller mode, it easily climbs up the list of Apple TV+’s best shows."
Severance,1,"""Severance"" is a show that gets more mysterious the more it reveals, and the last two episodes of the season had me so anxious that my dog started whining at me in concern."
Severance,1,Severance’s entire cast is a symphony without a single off-note.
Severance,1,Mixing the quirky workplace drudgery of The Office with the dystopian dread of 1984 ... Severance is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying.
Severance,1,"If you are like me, you are going to finish each episode with a lot of theories and even more questions. Severance is going to make you question your own work-life balance and keep you biting your nails until the very last scene."
Severance,1,"Stiller’s facility with tone, and the sheer oddity of innie life, makes the early chapters compelling even though very little happens at first."
Severance,1,"The most engrossing element of Severance is the many mysteries it presents, wrapped up in silent overarching questions of philosophy, morality, and free will versus choice."
Severance,1,"Eventually, Severance's central mystery picks up a bracing momentum, and the story delivers cloak-and-dagger intrigue and artful weirdness (what's the deal with that room full of baby goats?) as Mark's parallel lives career toward intersection."
Shining Girls,0,[An] intriguing but largely forgettable show.
Shining Girls,1,"Like any good crime thriller worth its salt, this latest effort starts with a fresh corpse and the hunt for a serial killer. But Shining Girls quickly separates itself from the pack, injecting some multiverse-inspired twists into its storytelling."
Shining Girls,1,"For all its flaws and messy experimentation, Shining Girls is a bold adaptation that revived an ancient anger in me that I’m deeply grateful for in 2022."
Shining Girls,1,"It’s an intriguing watch, and Moss’ patented, unglamorous intensity is rewarding."
Shining Girls,0,"To me this is contrived and exploitative. Also, I feel as though I’ve seen a lot of it before."
Shining Girls,1,"If you are coming into this series expecting something closer to Mindhunter, you may be disappointed. If you are prepared to follow an intricately plotted character study with some mind-bending multiversal elements, you are going to love this series."
Shining Girls,1,"There are two reasons to watch Shining Girls: it is based on the novel by South African author Lauren Beukes and it boasts incredibly intense and nuanced performances by Elisabeth Moss, Wagner Moura and Jamie Bell."
Shining Girls,1,"Due to the nature of episodic TV with so much time to fill, threads throughout this series become cumbersome and tiresome waiting for something to happen or to draw us back in. But the acting by Moss, Wagner and Bell will keep you in front of the screen."
Shining Girls,1,"Bell certainly deserves kudos for playing so damn skeezy. True to the disturbing book character, he sets your teeth on edge."
Shining Girls,1,"""Shining Girls” is undeniably kooky, but the characters, situations and the city itself are so vividly brought to life that you’ll be dying to figure out what happens next."
Shining Girls,1,"It’s a strong, potentially off-putting gambit, but Moss and the creative team sell it magnificently, ensuring that this might just be one of the most addictive TV thrillers of 2022."
Shining Girls,1,"The dark and grim Shining Girls has moments that are hard to stomach – you may also have filled your quota on violence perpetrated against female characters – but the plotting, performances and vibe are crafted so well, it is compelling to watch."
Shining Girls,1,"If you can give your full attention and have patience, Shining Girls is a confident drama with a satisfying pay-off, plus a powerful metaphor for trauma and women not being taken seriously in the aftermath of a crime."
Shining Girls,1,"By using oppressive pasts as a foundation to leap into the traumas of the present, Shining Girls tackles bold ideas."
Shining Girls,1,"This show is fascinating, deeply disturbing, and utterly unlike anything else on television right now."
Shining Girls,1,"What emerges is an aria of fear that goes well beyond Shining Girls' crime-procedural surface.... As much as I hated the first couple of hours of the show, I loved -- in a creeped-out way -- the rest."
Shining Girls,1,"hining Girls takes its time to reveal the entire picture of what its story is about. But with a fine lead performance by Moss and expert direction, it’s still got enough tension to make us OK with getting only little bits of info."
Shining Girls,1,I almost got accustomed to the sags in pace because I knew there would be a peak following each valley.
Shining Girls,1,There’s a terrific thriller trying to break out of the sometimes-confusing plot machinations here. Close scrutiny is required and rewarded with a dose of the chills. Moss is astounding
Shining Girls,1,The acting is sublime. The writing is outstanding. And the Chicago Sun-Times of the early 1990s takes a triumphant victory lap.
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
Shining Girls,1,"Even as the female victim count adds up, Shining Girls keeps its integrity and never backs away from this underlying truth."
Shining Girls,1,"If what are meant to be the eerie parts of the story do not deliver much of a frisson, the more human interactions do create a nice glow."
Shining Girls,1,"They revolve around the magnetic teaming of Elisabeth Moss and Wagner Moura, who absolutely nail complicated characters who act like you or I might act if we were having an existential crisis that might kill us."
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
Shining Girls,1,"Shining Girls offers an intriguing mystery which takes some unexpected routes, featuring an Elisabeth Moss performance as strong as any on her remarkable résumé."
Shining Girls,1,"Not since David Fincher’s FBI profiling series has a show captured the mix of detective work and gut-churning, mounting tension as this... But ultimately, Shining Girls sacrifices psychological depth for quantum flash."
Shining Girls,1,"It’s further proof that when it comes to audience buy-in, whether the story is seemingly conventional or dauntingly out-there, having Moss at the top of the call sheet is as close to a guarantee as you’re ever going to get."
Shining Girls,0,There was simply not enough here to fill all that screen time. “Shining Girls” would have been better as a 105-minute movie.
Shining Girls,1,Is it a wholly satisfying eight episodes? Not completely  things start to drag a bit in the middle and the end feels a tad rushed once we get to it. But I was entertained and kept coming back for more.
Shining Girls,1,"Between the high-concept premise, some great direction from Breaking Bad alum Michelle MacLaren, and the usual superhuman intensity from Elisabeth Moss in the lead role, the series transcends a lot of the usual clichés and pitfalls."
Shining Girls,1,"Shining Girls is a well-acted, intriguing series... But not everything in its story works, and with a high-concept drama such as this one, every misstep dims the show’s potential just a little bit more."
Shining Girls,0,"There’s good stuff here: Alongside Moss, Moura as the journalist aiding her, and Jamie Bell as the personification of human venality pursuing her, do fine work. But there’s simply not enough story here to make for a credible eight-episode series."
Shining Girls,1,"For those who enjoy a more experimental approach to storytelling, unburdened by the confines of one specific genre, Shining Girls is an exciting entry for Apple TV+."
Shining Girls,1,"On a show whose purposely bewildering twists function as metaphors for the psychological power aggressors wield over their victims, the only way to stop history from repeating is to confront it. This... is the method in Shining Girls’ madness."
Shining Girls,1,"While Shining Girls is an intricate and mind-bending game of cat and mouse the likes of which you haven't seen in this genre before, it's the notions of justice, overcoming trauma, and taking control of your destiny that set Shining Girls apart."
Shining Girls,1,"Moss and Bell absolute steal the show and, even with the story being a wonderfully concocted slow burn, you simply can't take your eyes off of the screen."
Shining Girls,0,iShining Girlsi ultimately doesnt give us much sense of whats at stake in its byzantine narrative.
Shining Girls,1,"While the Apple TV+ series certainly merits fair warning for its mature themes, learning too much about its premise may detract from its rewarding twists and turns"
Shining Girls,1,"If you're willing to pace yourself, and let the mysteries of ""Shining Girls"" slowly envelope you, you might be rewarded with an addictive new series."
Shining Girls,1,"'Shining Girls' features an ensemble cast who play incredibly nuanced, interesting characters that will draw you in. The blended genres make for a thrilling viewing experience that will leave you still processing the events that unfold in each episode."
Tehran,1,"As twisted as it is, the story never forgets to give us some depth of feeling about all the players, no matter which side they are on."
Tehran,1,"It’s a corkscrewing drama that paints a nuanced portrait of a country often caricatured as one-dimensionally theocratic and anti-Western. Just as importantly, it ratchets up the tension with bruising panache."
Tehran,1,A thriller so hectic it makes Homeland look like one of those ambient noise apps that send you off to sleep.
Tehran,1,"Israel has produced several masterfully crafted, suspenseful espionage dramas in recent years and Tehran is one of the very best."
Slow Horses,1,"A series that, although it explores some of the usual clichés in these stories, does so with great efficiency and a sensitivity that invites the viewer to binge-watch its 8 half-hour episodes with a permanent smile on their lips. [Full review in Spanish]"
Slow Horses,1,"Consistently maintains its tension, while hitting its mark to make you laugh.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Slow Horses,1,"A jigsaw puzzle with multiple traps, confabulations, and betrayals... [Full review in Spanish]"
Slow Horses,1,Director James Hawes creates a world of light and shadow that perfectly contrasts intrigue with truth.
Slow Horses,1,Slow Horses' subversive take on Bond and Bourne tropes is further elevated by dark humor -- mostly delivered by the frequently inappropriate and flatulent Oldman -- as well as slick pacing and some engrossing plot seeds we can't wait to watch more of.
Slow Horses,1,"It has the classic British spy feel with the cover-ups, conspiracies, characters working against each other. It feels like the old John la Carré novels."
Slow Horses,1,"Imagine 24 with an inferiority complex, or James Bond as an unloved Eeyore of the spy trade."
Slow Horses,1,"Still, despite its slow start and occasionally meandering plot, Slow Horses is a nice homage to the classic spy genre, with a heaping dash of irreverence and self-awareness thrown in to create an effectively compelling watch."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses takes a beat to kick into motion, but once it does, it is tense, suspenseful, and occasionally fun, even as it falls back on the tropes of British espionage thrillers."
Slow Horses,1,"Zippy, mordant, a little silly, bracingly violent in places, and extremely British in its celebration of irascibility, rainy London streets, geopolitical decline, and governing class contemptibility."
Slow Horses,1,You can practically smell Gary Oldmans Jackson Lamb through the screen.
Slow Horses,1,Slow Horses is a frequently laugh-out-loud thrill as the failures are forced to become the front line troops.
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses, billed by Apple TV+ as a ""darkly funny espionage drama,"" seems to be unable to decide quite what it is."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses hardly reinvents the wheel, mostly comfortable with recycling spy-story archetypes with a few minor twists here and there. But when it’s this entertaining... it’s hard to complain about the end product."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is a solid, purposeful spy thriller that hits all the notes you want it to hit. The plot is satisfyingly dense and unpredictable without being unreadably labyrinthine."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is a show that believes even dumb, greasy, badly dressed cast-offs have it in them to outsmart slick, rich, powerful villains, and, well, that’s quite fun to watch."
Slow Horses,1,“Slow Horses” is in the tradition of other recent espionage adaptations like “The Little Drummer Girl.” It packs suspense that works because it always feels dangerously real.
Slow Horses,1,Gary Oldman delivers audiences an unhygienic anti-hero to remember in this new Apple original drama.
Slow Horses,0,"Even at six episodesmost of which are around 40 minutes longthe show feels like its going around in circles, dragging you by the hand along with it. And a lot of it requires massive leaps of logic."
Slow Horses,1,"It feels like some members of the Slough House team get short shrift, at least at first. But Oldman’s presence elevates our interest in just how everyone who works at Slough House actually got there."
Slow Horses,1,"It’s a decent start to the series. In addition to getting a sense of the MI5 pecking order, we also learn a bit about all the people working at Slough House."
Slow Horses,1,"If the terrorist plotting feels dated at times, there’s enough elsewhere to make up for it. Principally, the show’s stars, with Oldman and Scott Thomas a particularly fizzy double act."
Slow Horses,1,The premiere of AppleTV+s Slow Horses sets up a sharp spy thriller centering on an excellent performance by Gary Oldman. The timely drama blends dark humor and tense action for a novel ensemble spin on the genre.
Slow Horses,1,"By season’s end, Slow Horses feels more familiar than truly innovative, albeit with some sharper acting and jokes than most others it’s following."
Slow Horses,1,This adaptation is a welcome dog-eared antidote to the shiny globe-trotting nonsenses of the Bond franchise.
Slow Horses,1,"The series is adapted by Will Smith (the English one) who wrote for Veep and The Thick Of It, and it seethes with splendidly tart dialogue. But for all that, it’s a curiously warm series."
Slow Horses,1,"The action and violence, when it does happen, is fast, brutal and efficient. And just as quickly, the show is back to something that occasionally resembles a bleak workplace comedy. It’s an expert juggling of tones."
Slow Horses,1,"Smartly, often funny scripting, an ace cast of characters and a peek at failed spies is rousing and entertaining, and this is one heck of a great behind-the-scenes adventure."
Slow Horses,0,Deja vu is my primary experience of Slow Horses.
Slow Horses,1,"The mixture of office satire and espionage thriller isn't always balanced but the salty dialogue and a cast led by Gary Oldman as a misanthropic spy chief, makes this new Apple TV + series highly watchable."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is a comedy, something of a satire of le Carre-style capers, but it also manages to be a genuinely twisty, old-school spy thriller at the same time. So twisty in fact, it’s hard to keep up"
Slow Horses,1,"This is how you do a solid British intelligence thriller. Get some of the most seasoned British actor, add in a few really good younger British actors, provide them all with unusual characters and a tense story line laced with black humor."
Slow Horses,1,"Boasting a slew of crackerjack actors, this six-part thriller makes an excellent introduction to Herron's gleefully corrosive vision of British intelligence — and of present-day Britain."
Slow Horses,1,"The show around Oldman is not entirely up to the standards set by his performance, but it’s not too far off — “Slow Horses” is a highly satisfying celebration and sendup of the John le Carré novels that clearly inspired it."
Slow Horses,1,"A smart, witty, cleverly plotted piece about a group of outcasts in the world of espionage."
Slow Horses,1,"It takes an episode or two to fire up the engine of Apple TV+’s twist-filled six-part series, but your patience gets rewarded in enormous ways."
Slow Horses,1,"Gary Oldman is a force of nature in Slow Horses, a stellar spy series that finally puts a fresh spin on the genre in a way that makes even Slough House somewhere we hope to keep visiting for many years to come."
Slow Horses,1,"A good combination of clever twists and unexpected turns, executed expertly by the actors, makes Slow Horses fly."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is ostensibly a comedy, but it also works as a thriller, a terrorism procedural and a humanist study -- there’s not an uninteresting character in the show"
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses is both gripping and non-gripping; you won’t want to binge it, but when you do tune in, you will be required to give yourself fully to each episode."
Slow Horses,1,"Slow Horses gets to have its cake and eat it too, combining a genuinely tense thriller plot with the unexpected comedy of the people trying to solve it being outcasts of whom nothing is expected."
Slow Horses,1,"To say it’s a pleasure to watch Oldman in this role is inadequate; if you’re a fan of spy fiction, you have to use words that make you feel almost corny, like, “it’s a gift.”"
Slow Horses,1,"The series is more of a dark office comedy than spy show, finding most of its drama in the tension radiating between its characters."
Slow Horses,1,"Some of the humor from Herron’s book gets lost in translation to a six-episode season, but Slow Horses still has enough twists and turns and gritty London texture to keep its excellent ensemble busy."
Slow Horses,1,"For fans of spy thrillers, this is definitely for you. And, if youre like me and could take or leave a spy story, I think youll find a lot to like with Slow Horses."
Slow Horses,1,“Slow Horses” plays like a serendipitous meeting between John le Carré and Elmore Leonard.
Slow Horses,1,"Oldman turns Lamb into a layered character who you will like despite how unlikeable he is. Had this series focused more on him than the ensemble, it likely would have been better, but as an introduction to an ongoing series, this is a decent start. S"
Slow Horses,1,"While it’s entirely watchable, Slow Horses is unlikely to drag you away from whatever else you’re currently viewing."
Slow Horses,1,The series manages to play with and rearrange familiar tropes to create something arresting and often very funny.
Slow Horses,1,"With plenty more Herron source material at its disposal, there’s the potential for this to be one of many future “Slow Horses” mysteries. As such, his opening season has some of the growing pains of a first big case."
Slow Horses,1,"Not quite a comedy, not quite a full-on espionage thriller, Slow Horses is a compelling series that keeps you guessing about where the story will take its hard-luck agents."
Slow Horses,1,"A grimily authentic espionage yarn populated by a bunch of funny, intriguing “losers, misfits and boozers”, as they’re described in the lyrics of the wonderfully atmospheric Mick Jagger theme song."
Slow Horses,1,"If you want an excellent slow-burn surveillance mystery delivered point-blank, this is it. It’s produced well, written better, and manages to maintain that one-two punch throughout."
Slow Horses,1,"It’s solidly entertaining, well-acted and well-plotted."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Physical,1,"Byrne plays Sheila with emotional dexterity to match the character's physical fitness... this smart and entertaining series from creator/writer/producer Annie Weisman (Suburgatory, The Path) does indeed have it all."
Physical,1,The dark comedy figured out where it went so wrong in its first season: It’s giving us the Rose Byrne ferocious ’80s aerobics instructor show we were all promised.
Physical,1,"There’s a buoyancy to this season that’s engaging. Though watching Season 1 of “Physical” helps establish the various characters, there’s enough separation of time that you could jump into the second season with only a cursory viewing of the first."
Physical,1,What started as an intriguing enough concept gets better in the second season of Apple TV’s “Physical.”
Physical,1,"Sheila is conniving, unkind, fake, deceitful and opportunistic. Yet, she is the most sympathetic character. Byrne’s portrayal is so flawless, the voiceover narration of her thoughts is entirely unnecessary."
Physical,1,"The increased focus on character depth and dynamics is a welcome change, and one that hopefully signals the series’ second season will actually have something significant to say."
Physical,1,"Weisman and Co. don’t shy away from uncomfortability and human error. Each of these characters gets called out on their guff, and it’s their handling of it that’s Physical’s ultimate power move. Awards are coming!"
Physical,1,"It's worth the investment of time over the season for what it reveals about Sheila and the great challenges of living in that period of time in that place in a male-dominated culture that has been, and is still, extremely slow to change."
Physical,1,"Physical Season 2 is perfect Rose Byrne, and a perfect balance of the darkness and humor that pulled me into the series initially. I wasn’t sure that the series could get better, but it did..."
Physical,1,"Byrne continues to prove that she is one of our very best actresses today, navigating a complex part, one that calls for her to be funny, fierce, and at times, frightening. It’s an awards-worthy performance, as is the ensemble, as is the show."
The Essex Serpent,1,"With a muted but indulgent visual palette, The Essex Serpent not only looks amazing but its leads propel it beyond the standard period piece affair into the stratosphere."
The Essex Serpent,1,Fear and faith anchor a moody historical drama.
The Essex Serpent,0,"Despite its riveting source material, The Essex Serpent ends up being a gothic bore. Even the charms of Tom Hiddleston can't save this one."
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
The Essex Serpent,1,"A satisfying series that explores the possibilities and limitations of ambition, progress and human connection."
The Essex Serpent,1,"A dark plot that ponders the clash of faith and science, with a chemistry that’s hotting up, this has reeled me right in."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
The Essex Serpent,0,[The greater concepts] are squandered for the mundane banality of the people in this town.
The Essex Serpent,0,"If you are hoping for Crimson Peak or The Others, this isn’t it either. But, if you are a fan of Jane Eyre or deliberately paced 19th-century British dramas with solid performances, you may enjoy The Essex Serpent. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Restrained as a corset, it feels as if The Essex Serpent doesn't want us to excite ourselves or to get any ideas beyond the ones drolly lined out for us. And that's a shame."
The Essex Serpent,1,"Those expecting the show to make good on its promise of a folkloric thriller might be disappointed, but those who surrender to its larger musings will find it rewarding."
The Essex Serpent,1,"The series isn’t perfect by any means -- it’s painfully slow-moving at points --but its moody, atmospheric setting, thoughtful explorations of faith and belief, and haunting Gothic romance vibes will certainly captivate many a viewer."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Against this beautiful backdrop, the human drama never crackles. Directed by Clio Barnard, the show seems to forget that, along with all the portentous symbolism, there needs to be a spark of wit or a flicker of emotional depth."
The Essex Serpent,1,"""Serpent"" ultimately draws you in with deeply-felt performances which tease out the inner lives of the characters, building up to an understated but intense and cathartic resolution. It would undoubtedly repay multiple viewings."
The Essex Serpent,1,"There’s a lot of talking, but not a lot of story propulsion, which makes us wonder if a six-part series was the best way to present this novel."
The Essex Serpent,1,"For a series that wants to have its eel pie and eat it, too, The Essex Serpent balances folk horror and romantic threads reasonably well..."
The Essex Serpent,0,This “Serpent” slithers away without leaving much of an impact.
The Essex Serpent,1,A great example of atmosphere combined with rich acting.
The Essex Serpent,1,A tense and heartfelt exploration of grief and belief and how much those two things can mess with you. The great sweaters are just a bonus.
The Essex Serpent,1,"It’s a lot for a TV drama, but it’s such an unusual story there’s little chance to be anything but enchanted, and terrific performances from Danes, Hiddleston and particularly Dillane as Dr Garrett, keep up the pace."
The Essex Serpent,1,"The Essex Serpent might not be something entirely unseen before in period drama fare, but with its commanding cast, intriguing premise and well-considered scientific and social context, it will certainly sweep viewers along with its story."
The Essex Serpent,1,"As historical fiction, as sleepy Gothic romance, as an understated showcase for its cast and crew’s talents, it’s impossible to escape The Essex Serpent‘s unexpected charms."
The Essex Serpent,1,"The Essex Serpent succeeds as a gothic meditation on the magic and wonder of the natural world, whether it’s seen through the lens of science or the supernatural. But it’s also a moving story about human connection."
The Essex Serpent,1,Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes effectively anchor The Essex Serpent with playful and passionate chemistry that crackles even when the overly ambitious limited series loses its way at times.
The Essex Serpent,1,"The Essex Serpent has an incredible texture to it. Even at its most unnerving, the series is impossible not to absorb like a humid fog permeating the skin."
The Essex Serpent,1,It’s a tasteful and static enterprise that deserves attention because it comes to life whenever Danes is onscreen.
The Essex Serpent,1,"If Perry's book is a novel of sensation posing as a novel of ideas, then Anna Symon's screenplay is more of the same; if you're after melodrama, you're in the right place."
The Essex Serpent,1,Another little work of art…. in times when “more” continues to be mistaken for “better.” [Full review in Spanish]
The Essex Serpent,1,"If the journey it takes can seem occasionally odd and even frustrating, it’s one guided by a steady heart toward an ultimately worthwhile destination."
The Essex Serpent,1,Symon’s take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists...
The Essex Serpent,1,"A moody, atmospheric, and visually stunning adaptation of Sarah Perry's novel, which is anchored by the chemistry between Danes and Hiddleston in the lead roles."
The Essex Serpent,0,"At least the drama lights up whenever Hiddleston appears on screen. Because it’s otherwise desperately dreary, which is unforgivable when the source material is so rich."
The Essex Serpent,1,"Apple TV’s The Essex Serpent is an atmospheric, melancholy mystery/love story about abuse, repression, and renewal. But its critique of misogyny is confusedly undermined when it blames its central character for inspiring love."
The Essex Serpent,0,Some viewers are sure to enjoy its generally slow pacing — and all that breathing the story is allowed to do — but others may find their attention drifting more than once.
The Essex Serpent,1,"What may sound like a romantic soap opera plays as an urgent, if melodramatic, investigation into changing cultural mores and slowly evolving views on the importance of medicine and science in overturning deeply-held beliefs that are rooted in rumor."
The Essex Serpent,1,An intriguing drama that likely won’t be for everyone … but it rewards those who don’t mind a show that’s strange and murky.
The Essex Serpent,1,"A Beast-Hunt Gives Way To A Gorgeous, Eerie Gothic Romance."
The Essex Serpent,1,"The Essex Serpent deals more in what we uncover by searching within ourselves, and by allowing those we love to really see what we were once willing to leave buried deep beneath the surface."
The Essex Serpent,1,"Overripe at times, it leaves room for enough mystery and respect for the unknown to keep mind and soul working in tandem toward a heady exploration of faith and doubt."
The Essex Serpent,1,"Gritty, pithy, compelling drama that’s one of the most accomplished and engrossing shows of the year so far."
The Essex Serpent,1,"Gorgeously shot, cleverly crafted, and brimming with intrigue, Clio Barnard’s latest reaffirms her status as one of Britain’s most important directors."
Foundation,1,Silence your phones: This show demands your attention... [Full review in Spanish]
Foundation,1,"While Foundation falls prey to peak TV's recurring pacing problem, it still manages to not only adapt a seminal classic sci-fi series but update it for a modern audience in a way that still makes it feel relevant despite its source material's age."
Foundation,1,"Virtually every episode offers a moral quandary with no easy answers. Theres no clear right and wrong here, which makes the drama and conflict all the more compelling."
Foundation,0,"As Hari Seldon, a heretical mathematician who claims to predict the social and political future, Jared Harris is the only bright spot in a cast that seems to be reciting its lines at a green screen and probably were."
Foundation,1,"The galaxy might be incomprehensibly vast, but Foundation still cares about the individuals fighting within it."
Foundation,1,"Some people are likely to be turned off by the plodding pace and posturing/pontificating. Pah, I say! If you're going to make a show that tries to get math to look sexy, you're going to lose a few people along the way."
Foundation,1,"As with all good sci-fi, Foundation gives you plenty to chew on -- and the chewing has only just begun."
Foundation,0,"It would be enjoyable if they had a bit more fun with it, but watching it felt like I was in a meeting."
Foundation,0,"A forced, utterly humorless march into sci-fi history."
Foundation,1,"If the series is passionate about anything, it's the uplifting clarity of science and math... One scene starring Gaal is a literal math montage that's as sensual as anything that happens in bed."
Foundation,1,Here's hoping Foundation finds its feet and its personality more in upcoming episodes.
Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible."
Foundation,0,"Foundation attempts to achieve as many plot points as possible from the beginning, which is concerning early on. Hopefully, the jittery exposition is only served to launch the series, and the story improves from here."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
Foundation,0,"By keeping the audience at arm's length, Foundation also makes it that much harder to connect with any of the characters, despite some solid performances from the entire cast."
Foundation,1,"Austere and slow-moving, Foundation may not boast characters that immediately grab you. But this stylish, serious series lays a solid foundation for an intriguing sci-fi diversion."
Foundation,1,"There's a lot to unravel in Foundation, and the first two episodes - while utterly enthralling - may be quite confusing for some."
Foundation,1,"Foundation has achieved the impossible, bringing Asimov's universe to the small screen with coherence and flexibility. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Foundation,0,"Whether Foundation works for you is going to depend on your mileage for sci-fi. If you're a dedicated junkie, already conversant in either Asimov's writings or in the genre tropes, it's likely a lot easier to digest."
Foundation,1,"There is a lot to unpack here and I found that with each subsequent episode I was more invested in the story, but I am not sure if general audiences will be invested enough to see this through to the end."
Foundation,1,"The opening two episodes of Foundation are extremely promising, covering a lot of ground and leaving you desperate to see where the story will go, as well as delivering some earthshaking shock moments."
Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this."
Foundation,1,"Great sci-fi sends the mind and heart racing, and 'Foundation' does exactly that."
Foundation,1,"Sprawling and convoluted, yet completely coherent once you gauge the cadence and tone, there are few programs capable of coming close to this level of reality."
Foundation,1,"The two other most compelling characters are easily those played by Lee Pace and Jared Harris. Whenever these two actors are giving elaborate speeches or chewing the scenery, Foundation soars to its epic science-fiction heights."
Foundation,1,"At this point the acting and script are standard for the genre: neutral, passionless, rising to a light pomposity. For the moment it's left to Pace and Harris to strike all the sparks."
Foundation,1,"At times it's imperfect, certainly, and not all of the choices work. But overall Foundation is an exciting, imaginative and intelligent space opera with a lot to offer anyone in the mood for some immersive science fiction."
Foundation,1,"Let's just say the opening episodes of Foundation have made a fantastic, if slightly uneven, foundation for your next favourite show."
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
Foundation,1,One of the most impressive feats Foundation pulls off is never letting you forget it is individuals affected by galaxy-wide events.
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
Foundation,1,"A gorgeous, overcomplicated Isaac Asimov adaptation about the collapse of an empire. It won't be a ratings hit, but it certainly drew me in."
Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" is incredible to look at. The visuals are spectacular."
Foundation,1,The series certainly feels as though it's been constructed by people with a love for Asimov's writing.
Foundation,1,"I think Asimov himself would be pleased with Foundation, particularly since his daughter Robyn is an executive producer on the series and signed off on Goyer's vision."
Foundation,1,"We shouldn't have to sit through hours of TV that makes our heads spin to get to stuff like this, that entertains and challenges us. But in this case, the patience does pay off."
Foundation,1,The performances are staggering. Lee Pace is jaw-dropping as the Galactic Emperor Brother Day. Jared Harris portrays the role of Hari Seldon as if he's actually lived the character's life and Lou Llobell is unstoppable.
Foundation,1,Foundation has very much started to reward the effort and developed a habit of ending episodes with breathless cliffhangers that practically dare viewers to stop watching.
Foundation,1,"When ""Foundation"" draws on that core, and manages to make discussions of those questions more intuitive than didactic, it's invigorating to see so many component parts work in tandem."
Foundation,1,Foundation's set and costume designs are more impressive than many feature film projects. This is an expansive sci-fi story told in ten parts that feel limitless.
Foundation,1,"Packed with massive starships, sprawling vistas, slick technology, and incredibly imaginative costumes, it's a big -- and clearly big-budget -- affair that could easily stand up against any silver-screen sci-fi epic."
Foundation,1,"Foundation is reminiscent of many science fiction works, the most obvious being Star Wars. It's not super exciting, but it's visuals and acting make for a captivating space tale."
Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in."
Foundation,1,"Not just an adaptation of a long-revered work of science fiction, but a thoughtful, provocative, consistently compelling series worthy of the investment in time and effort to reach the final moments of its ten-hour running time."
Foundation,1,"Foundation's ten episodes are sumptuous TV and showrunner David S. Goyer has successfully brought an extremely difficult book series to life on the screen, even if it doesn't really feel much like the original source material."
Foundation,0,"As with some of Apple's other high budget series, the desire to look massive overtakes a lean narrative... This is probably the priciest slow burner show ever made."
Foundation,1,"Sometimes the mood is deliberately lightened, clearly to aid accessibility, and when it is, the tone clashes jarringly ... [but] it feels mostly respectful to Asimov's tone and story, which may make it good for the fans and incomprehensible to [others]."
Foundation,1,I feel like it's a partial realization... it's straying quite a bit away from the Foundation idea while still trying to do cerebral science fiction.
Foundation,1,"I'll just thank the science-fiction gods that Foundation, often considered an impossible-to-adapt Isaac Asimov property, received such a lavish, compelling treatment."
Foundation,1,"The intrigue, imaginative costumes and sets, and the dramatic and unexpected violence - including a terrorist attack that is both breathtaking and horrifying - will certainly hold your attention."
Foundation,1,"I do love the sheer size and scope of the show, though: the visual effects look stunning... [Pace] is absolutely perfect dancing between callousness and charisma as Brother Day."
Foundation,1,"More than just being aesthetically pleasing, the visuals contribute to the worldbuilding... Just give me some interesting characters!"
Foundation,1,"Its emotional expanse ... is a bit more of a question, but the show sucks you in a great deal."
Foundation,1,Season one comes off as a 10-episode pilot for later seasons - one just good enough for us to want to stick with the show. But the sluggish storytelling suggests there were good reasons Asimov's books did not make it to screen before.
Foundation,0,"There is no saga too epic for a little levity, and here it might have made some of the characters more believable. It might even have made me want to wade through the complexity."
Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor."
Foundation,1,Foundation is a promising but cautious piece of sci-fi epic storytelling.
Foundation,1,"The fantastical settings and epic scope make it closer in feel to Thrones, but the need for patience as things develop hews much closer to Simon's snowballing exploration of crime, culture, and community in Baltimore."
Foundation,1,"Remixing Asimov's characters, settings and themes into something more timely and fitting for television versus the page, this iteration of ""Foundation"" thrives most when becoming something all its own."
Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" has been reinvented as something more accessible, more vibrant, more action-driven, sexier, and yes, more fun in the traditional sense of the word."
Foundation,0,"The dense, at-times muddled narrative offers little to warrant the enthusiasm to justify that, leaving behind an impenetrable show that looks like several million bucks but feels as if it lacks the tools to save itself, much less all mankind."
Foundation,0,"While shows don't need to hold our hands or slowly spoon-feed us information, they do need to help us follow along. No one enjoys feeling like they're missing something, but that's exactly what happens as you sit down to watch these episodes."
Foundation,1,"The result is an adaptation that's generally faithful to Asimov's original work, but that also expands on events in interesting ways that the exposition-heavy novel didn't in 1951."
Foundation,0,The show's starry-eyed ambitions are dulled by its execution. Its scattered focus stalls momentum by introducing and discarding characters like a wad of receipts found in your back pocket after a night on the town.
Foundation,1,"Even as Foundation stumbles throughout its execution, it still maintains a grip on the unconditional hope of its characters."
Foundation,1,Spectacular.
Foundation,1,"It's an interesting approach, although some of these micro stories are stronger than others."
Foundation,1,"While there's much to enjoy in ""Foundation,"" if the goal is to instill hope, then all of humanity should be present."
Foundation,0,"Foundation has no evident limitations of any kind, yet no real visceral impact for the most part, because it's almost stultifyingly dull, especially in its middle episodes."
Foundation,1,"Foundation could easily have become an overwhelming mess of confusing concepts and names, but it finds the right balance between visual spectacle, epic plots, and human drama."
Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands."
Foundation,1,"""Foundation"" jumps back and forth in time and from one world to another as it breaks into myriad storylines. It does initially seem a bit too enthralled with bloated world-building but things pick up as they splinter."
Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots."
Foundation,0,The individual parts of this Foundation equation add up to something that's very pretty and slightly dull. Asimov's books have long been considered impossible to adapt. This version is a noble effort that can't quite solve the problem.
Foundation,1,"Perhaps the best aspect of Foundation, beyond all the money spent on sets and effects, is the amount of humanity that's allowed to thrive on screen."
Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted."
Foundation,1,"While it delivers in both scope and spectacle, Foundation is not for the faint-hearted. This is a slice of rock-hard sci-fi that tickles the intellect with concepts both philosophical and profound."
Foundation,1,Conjures up its own vision for what might happen.
Foundation,1,"Foundation isn't sure if it wants to be a philosophic metaphor for war and why we should listen to the thinkers not the shooters, or if it wants to be a sexed-up sci-fi about revolutionaries carrying on a movement long after the founder has gone."
Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be."
Foundation,1,"With a sumptuous big-budget production, enigmatic performances & a compelling examination of the human condition, Apple TV+ has another hit on their hands."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Foundation,1,"Outside of aesthetic considerations, the series' first two episodes focus on themes that are both poignant and agonizingly familiar."
Foundation,1,"This is definitely more Westworld than The Mandalorian, and things don't start paying off or making any sense until halfway through episode three. There's no instant gratification in Foundation. Well, other than Lee Pace's arms."
Foundation,1,"Foundation is thin on character development and can get bogged down in narrative baggage, but its stellar cast makes this show worth watching."
Foundation,1,"Viewers who stick with it - and sci-fi fans in particular - will be intrigued, to say the least."
WeCrashed,0,"However great Hathaway and Leto are, though, at portraying these insufferable people, the fact remains that we have to watch these people be insufferable..."
WeCrashed,1,"Ambiguous, ambivalent, [and] contradicting because it isn’t entirely convincing, but at the same time fairly entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
WeCrashed,1,"This drama's cautionary portrait of unchecked ego is pretty much what viewers expect, but what might take them by surprise is the cockeyed yet rather enviable romance at its center."
WeCrashed,1,The show’s main hook is that it’s genuinely funny.
WeCrashed,0,
WeCrashed,0,I think we could all use a little Jared Leto break.
WeCrashed,1,Anne Hathaway’s Rebekah Neumann offers a complex portrayal of a woman determined to reach her goals but is stifled by the men around her while watching them expecting her to help them achieve theirs.
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed isn’t perfect, but Hathaway’s performance (and Leto’s, to a lesser extent) and the fact that Adam Neumann’s at times shown to be the hustler he is sold us on wanting to watch more."
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed plays out as a very flashy, glam and exceptionally entertaining piece of content, feeling more fictional than the true story it is."
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed is almost singularly focused on Adam Neumann (Jared Leto), for better and for worse - he's a compelling character, but for WeCrashed to work as an eight-hour television drama it needs to broaden its scope."
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
WeCrashed,0,"In general, the series is a bit like the neon ""Hustle Harder"" signs that adorn the WeWork offices we see here -- flashy but vague."
WeCrashed,1,"Jared Leto gives another immersive performance, and the show doesn't tell you how you should think about Adam Neumann. It's ""The Social Network"" meets ""The Wolf of Wall Street"""
WeCrashed,1,"It's hard to look away from ""WeCrashed"" – although there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments that may make viewers avert their eyes. Even if you know how the WeWork story ends, it's an enthralling ride to the inevitable implosion."
WeCrashed,1,"Goes long on the idea that watching two infuriatingly self-involved yet eminently attractive people, portrayed by two very talented actors, is an intrinsically compelling proposition."
WeCrashed,1,"This cautionary tale about the flameout of the 47 billion workplace startup WeWork 
feels like a terrific two-hour movie trapped in a meandering, eight-hour  miniseries,but Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway dazzle as the delusional founding couple."
WeCrashed,0,"In declining to conjecture what WeWork’s nosedive meant for the rest of us, it’s got even less of a purpose than a co-working space during a pandemic."
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
WeCrashed,1,This deeply enjoyable schadenfreude tale will have you rubbing your eyes in disbelief and asking: how?
WeCrashed,1,"Its best moments occur when they present the hypocrisy behind both main protagonists...Flaws and all, the show survives because its protagonists are the equivalent of a car accident: you don't like what you're seeing but you can't stop looking."
WeCrashed,1,"Both [Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto] inhabit their characters so persuasively, relate to one another -- and the world -- so credibly that it becomes impossible not to feel the depth of their connection."
WeCrashed,0,"There is little here that is enjoyable to watch and even less that is entertaining, and spending eight hours with the versions of these people portrayed by Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is a punishment."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
WeCrashed,1,"It’s open for debate whether this decade of exuberance was good for the wider economy, but one thing is now apparent: it makes for great TV."
WeCrashed,0,"Unfortunately, caring about the demise of rich people is just outside my scope of interest, and I was left with little to care about for another episode of WeCrashed."
WeCrashed,1,"It’s a tale for our times, and while it occasionally lags, “WeCrashed” catalogues a changing work environment to perfection."
WeCrashed,1,"Yes, you’ll have fun watching WeCrashed, even if the rhythms of the story are a little cliched. I did. My problem, and I fully admit that it’s a Debbie Downer of a problem, is that yet again we are elevating some truly godforsaken people."
WeCrashed,0,"There’s only so much posturing, partying and profligacy one can take before it gets wearisome."
WeCrashed,1,"It treads familiar ground to other rise-and-fall cautionary tales, and somewhat lacks a point of view — but WeCrashed is still farcically entertaining, buoyed by Jared Leto’s electric performance as Adam Neumann."
WeCrashed,1,"The series fully captures the Monopoly money quality of the startup era, the sense that nothing is quite real, and certainly not relatable to most people on the planet."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed trods a more than a well-worn path, as Apple TV+ joins the list of streamers eager to capitalize on the con artist trend."
WeCrashed,1,"The absurdity of WeCrashed is what makes it a truly great cringe drama, as we watch this couple and this company fail upwards."
WeCrashed,0,"However, unlike the significantly better The Dropout . . . WeCrashed is a series that lacks a clear point of view and cant decide just what tone it wants to set when exploring the rise and fall of the Neumanns."
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed stands out with its fascinating mix of entrepreneurial capitalism, frou frou new-age spirituality and an inspiring love story that fuels its protagonists to great heights."
WeCrashed,1,"Within the bloat of its myriad acts of corporate intrigue, the push and pull of investors and board meetings, WeCrashed succeeds most when it keeps its focus on Hathaway’s space-cadet performance and the innate absurdity that underpins its true story."
WeCrashed,1,"There is a lot to enjoy in this slick production, and Anne Hathaway, as one half of the WeWork couple, is a force to be reckoned with."
WeCrashed,0,"Boy howdy if it doesn’t match former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann pound-for-pound on crappy decision-making, hapless showmanship, and missed opportunities to get back to basics."
WeCrashed,1,"For all the talk of unicorns and rental leases and IPOs, the real drama is a human one."
WeCrashed,1,"A handsome production that’s easy to watch, but one without enough consequence to merit the time."
WeCrashed,1,"While its sparing criticism for the system that created them can be infuriating at times, lively performances and a playful tone make WeCrashed eminently fun to watch — probably more fun than it should be."
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
WeCrashed,1,"WeCrashed makes for a reasonably entertaining reenactment by relishing in the can-you-believe-this-crap absurdity of Neumann’s worst impulses, but has little to add to the beats we already know by heart."
WeCrashed,1,"Why would anyone want to watch another one of these? A couple of reasons, actually: Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway."
WeCrashed,0,"The show seems overtly fascinated with Adam Neumann's con... but the consequences of his financial shell-game (many of which fell on his overworked, underpaid workforce) are largely treated as an afterthought."
WeCrashed,1,'WeCrashed' gives a great crash course (pun intended) into the origin story of Adam Neumann and what he did for the co-working space. The series is filled with brilliant performances by both Leto and Hathaway and offers a memorable quirky soundtrack.
WeCrashed,1,"Anne Hathaway steals the show in a sleek, seductive tale of a startup gone wrong."
Servant,1,"Even when the story is bad and the characters don't make sense, the show knows just how to craft the perfect cliffhanger to get audiences to tune in the next week and feel like there is enough good to keep going."
Servant,1,"Granted, the confounding nature of the Servant’s plot hasn’t affected my enjoyment of the series, which can be darkly funny, disturbing, bleak, and often incredibly tense, but I’d like to think I would have a better handle on the show by now."
Servant,1,"Servant's third year lives up to the potential this premise started out with and will hopefully stick the landing. At the very least, you are definitely going to rethink wearing rings on your fingers by the time you finish watching this show."
Servant,1,I'm as high on this show as I can be.
Servant,1,Another veiled horror festival that raises even further the tension and impact levels while adding enough novelties to keep fresh the formula without betraying a bit of its essence.
Servant,1,"Like a lot of Shyamalan-associated work, Servant is slyly, quietly funny, but it's also concerned with real human ache, compellingly funneled through Ambrose, Kebbell, and Free's performances."
Servant,1,"While Season 2 had pacing issues, [season three premiere] ""Donkey"" hits the ground running and is bolstered by strong performances."
Servant,1,The third season of the spooky Apple TV+ series proves there's something rewardingly compelling about being strung along in this excessive fashion.
Servant,1,"As Servant advances into season 3 with all its tonal ideocracies intact, audiences may start to question that pedestrian pace, but ultimately, there is no doubting the ensemble cast."
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
Servant,1,"By stripping away the campy bells and bizarro whistles, it's found a nice mix of silly and sinister-a show that gets in, gooses the audience repeatedly with an acidic smile, and gets out."
Servant,1,"Consistency is key here. While the mysteries consistently pull us along for the ride, consistent character flaws will have us question how long we should stick around."
Pachinko,1,"A story that intertwines themes of love, loyalty, and faithfulness (or not) to traditions. [Full review in Spanish]"
Pachinko,1,Pachinko the show is just as beautiful as the book on which it's based.
Pachinko,1,"The series shines in each and every one of its artistic, technical and narrative aspects, rising as one of the best cathodic productions that we'll be able to enjoy throughout 2022."
Pachinko,1,"Riveting, knife-sharp, poetic, this adaptation of an acclaimed novel from Min Jin Lee holds secrets; an epic family saga that integrates meaning within meaning."
Pachinko,1,A series whose greatest flaw may be that it will leave the audience wanting more.
Pachinko,1,"This is grand-scale drama, both epic and intimate, beautifully acted and completely engrossing."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko asks us to question just how much the world has improved when the people held down by misogyny, classism, and xenophobia are the very people instrumental to industrial and financial progress."
Pachinko,1,"Justin Chon, as well as a uniformly excellent ensemble cast, beautifully conveys the sweep and spirit of the novel. The only major misstep is a structural choice that undermines Lee’s carefully paced storytelling."
Pachinko,1,"This is an unfinished epic, and I look forward to another chapter."
Pachinko,1,"Throughout it's eight immaculate episodes, ""Pachinko"" weaves a beautiful and profoundly moving melodrama about a matriarch's perseverance to maintain her national identity, and the long-lasting, devastating effects of colonialism."
Pachinko,1,"This eight-episode season lacks for little, delivering satisfaction on a cellular level entirely on its own. For that same reason, eight episodes is not enough. Every rich moment satisfies, and each will make you ache for more."
Pachinko,1,"Historical epics aren’t new. Nor are family dramas that span generations, or period pieces... And yet, Apple TV Plus’ newest drama, Pachinko, manages to take all of these tropes and refine them into something beautifully specific and new."
Pachinko,1,The masterful show spans generations in a story of the forces that shape a family.
Pachinko,1,Life’s rich pageant is present and correct in Pachinko and it’s magnificent. A strong shout for the most satisfying TV of the year so far.
Pachinko,1,"If the settings are epic, the human element is more complex, yet emotionally universal."
Pachinko,1,"The perfection of the series resides in all of the elements blending perfectly: the acting, the directing, the story, and the production aspects. It may be too early to say this, but Pachinko may be one of the year's best series."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is an epic that truly has the feel of an epic, but with a through-line of oppression and racism that permeates every time period it portrays."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is stunning, important television, of the sort we don’t see often enough in this medium."
Pachinko,1,"An exceptional boldness and truthfulness in vision reverberate through every layer of Pachinko: its story is full of searing humanity, its casting is thoughtful, and the project boasts a formidable multi-national team of producers, consultants, and crew."
Pachinko,1,"Deeply emotional, this eight-episode Apple TV+ series barely scratches the surface of the novel upon which it's based, and will surely leave a core audience clamoring for more."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is breathtaking in almost every department. Epic in scope but intimate in focus, it is easily not just one of this year’s great dramas; it stands out as among the best of the past few years."
Pachinko,1,"An impressive, grandiose work, with one major caveat."
Pachinko,1,"It’s a vast, sumptuous, dynastic political TV series of the kind scarcely made any more, complete with swooning strings from Nico Muhly’s score."
Pachinko,1,It is a quiet masterpiece.
Pachinko,1,"Featuring strong, supple performances and a thoughtful, propulsive narrative, Pachinko resembles a magnificent melodramatic epic."
Pachinko,1,"It’s a deeply rewarding, even exquisite work..."
Pachinko,1,"Living up to the quality of Min Jin Lee's novel is a daunting challenge. This adaptation is smart enough to not go 1:1 and puts its own spin on the structure. The results are a beautiful and often heartbreaking story of identity, family, and sacrifice."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is a terrific example of how to highlight the harsh realities of the immigrant experience in a humanist manner, without compromising on anger against the oppressors, but making sure to not incite hate against them."
Pachinko,1,"The best series I've seen so far in 2022, giving Apple TV Plus even more strength in its ""quality versus quantity"" strategy. It's human, powerful, emotional, masterfully shot, acted and directed, a work of art in eight episodes."
Pachinko,0,"While showrunner Soo Hugh cannot have had an easy task in finding the series within this sprawling, multigenerational novel, and while she conjures moments of immense power, and of connection, throughout, Pachinko does not, finally, cohere."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is a sweeping epic filled with fantastic performances and a captivating story of survival. The entire ensemble is excellent, especially with Youn Yuh-Jung and Lee Min-ho showcasing their immense talent."
Pachinko,1,"Nostalgic and reminiscent, a new Korean, Japanese and English family drama details a painful history between two nations and its effect on a multigenerational family."
Pachinko,1,"When at its best, which is the case through nearly all its eight-episode first season, “Pachinko” is a lesson in how to do melodrama right."
Pachinko,1,“Miraculous” is a word that constantly came to mind while watching the eight-episode first season.
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is timeless in how it grapples with the complexities of immigration during very specific times, and the writing accurately captures the longing for—and meaning of—home."
Pachinko,1,Pachinko has become the new standard for television.
Pachinko,1,Soo Hugh’s eight-part adaptation of Min Jin Lee’s acclaimed novel traces the trials of a Korean-immigrant family across generations in the face of Japanese oppression.
Pachinko,1,"The intricate emotions and situations combined with a vast cast of characters do require an attentive audience, but it’s one of the most impressive series yet on any streamer."
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko offers a cornucopian narrative that's at once a multi-generational epic, an immigrant saga, a history lesson, a portrait of cultural bigotry, a high-class soap opera and a celebration of women's capacity to survive even the darkest circumstances."
Pachinko,1,The show finds boundless human complexity and different kinds of love beneath melodramatic cliches.
Pachinko,1,I came out of Pachinko frantic for another chapter in Sunja's story  and knowing more about Korean-Japanese relations than I learned in four years of higher education.
Pachinko,1,"Several times an episode ended after I thought it had been playing for about 15 minutes. It’s rich, deep and wholly engrossing."
Pachinko,1,I do wish watching Pachinko could last forever.
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko, AppleTV+s stunning adaptation of Min Jin Lees novel, is the next great television series from the emerging streaming network."
Pachinko,1,"Splitting the narrative into two (and later more) time periods makes the story more manageable and, more importantly, it lets the characters and their situations talk to each other across the decades."
Pachinko,1,"To be clear, I am happy to see a series like Pachinko arrive. The show is well intentioned and well made... But if Pachinko returns for a second season, it would do well to be bold in its telling of Sunja’s story."
Pachinko,1,iPachinkoi is an artfully staged and detailed historical epic that details one familys experiences across generations.
Pachinko,1,"Pachinko is a gorgeous TV show that will transport you with its straightforward charm and epic soul. But like all art, it also pulls off that most holy miracle: it will make you feel more human."
Pachinko,1,"Even if this were well-trod territory, Pachinko covers the subject with such artistry and grace that it would still feel special. It’s a family saga that combines the denseness of prose fiction with the specific advantages of television."
Pachinko,1,"AppleTV+’s Pachinko provides a compelling story of otherness, familial sacrifice, and the generational burden that comes with it, delivering on both entertainment and more than a few emotional moments."
Pachinko,1,"This Apple TV+ show is, like the 490-page book, epic in its scale -- and enrapturing in its execution."
Pachinko,1,"That idea of having a clear glimpse at some portions of the past and only being able to grasp at others seems fundamental to the idea of a shared family history. It makes Pachinko a lovingly crafted paradox, one worth giving yourself over to."
Pachinko,1,"""Pachinko"" is a story told in pieces, but the pieces are more vibrant, earnest, and stirring than most any other show on TV today."
Pachinko,1,"Vivid and lush, Pachinko is another important step forward for Asian representation on the screen, but it's also a frustrating adaptation."
Pachinko,1,"An epic, breathtaking multigenerational family drama, Pachinko will grab your heart and make it feel full. This is a love letter for immigrants everywhere, but especially for the Koreans living in Japan."
Pachinko,1,Pachinko is a harrowing portrait of suffering balanced against an elating tale of familial resilience and female strength.
Pachinko,1,Pachinko is a triumph of visual storytelling that goes in its own direction and finds a destination that leaves you absolutely floored in how masterfully it executes its vision.
The Morning Show,1,"While the second season involves plenty of strong acting from the cast, there was an attempt to squeeze in too much in. The story becomes too busy and involved."
The Morning Show,1,"Ultimately, it was a mess of a season, one where - aside from killing off Mitch Kessler - the series didn't advance the story much... Still, as beset by problems as it is, it was a very watchable season."
The Morning Show,0,"The plot became a haphazard mess, motivations were mysterious, no two storylines tied together, and the cast foundered. Saying it was off the rails was an insult to train derailments everywhere."
The Morning Show,0,It's baffling how a series with such a talented and star-studded cast managed to bypass prestige drama and land in the realm of soap opera.
The Morning Show,1,"Even after sitting through the 10 episodes, I'm not exactly sure whether I hate-liked the show or like-hated the show. But The Morning Show really doesn't care as long as I keep watching."
The Morning Show,1,"There's a fair bit of scene chewing in Morning Wars, so it only stands to reason that it's so dramatically delicious, you're going to eat it up."
The Morning Show,1,"Though the impending pandemic is still looming overhead, it's still interesting to watch characters deal with the turmoil of what was, objectively, everyone's least favorite year."
The Morning Show,1,"Not quite as entertaining as Season One, but still fascinating."
The Morning Show,1,"[The Morning Show] looks sleek and shiny, but it's artfully loaded with intriguing shades of grey."
The Morning Show,1,"A great cast with a lot behind this. The second season is even better, get on the bandwagon now while you have a chance."
The Morning Show,1,"The Morning show is still a show about sexism, misogyny, and the prejudice dynamics that endanger many to protect a few, Yet, this season observed how even the helpless can sell out."
The Morning Show,1,The Morning Show works on many levels: as a look at an industry struggling to keep up with the fast-changing times; as a dive into sexual politics in the 21st century workplace; and as a good old fashioned soapy tale of power and its pursuit.
The Morning Show,1,The teasers so far are promising... The teasers so far are promising.
The Morning Show,0,It's clear that whoever is writing the loaded conversations between these characters has never participated in one of their own to learn that this is simply not how we talk about any of it.
The Morning Show,1,"The key to The Morning Show might be that faults, however glaring, don't detract from the bright spots... it's a goofy mess undergirded by relevant themes-just enough of them to keep you on board even when the show can't keep itself from flying over..."
The Morning Show,1,"The Morning Show certainly features one of Aniston's finest performances. For those who don't know her much outside of Rachel Green or her work with Adam Sandler, this will be a revelation."
The Morning Show,1,"The show for all its faults, is a reflexive capsule of our time. The smug self-importance is organic to what it sets out to achieve."
The Morning Show,1,"It's the inner politics of UBA that keep the season darkly intriguing and sharp... All in all, ""The Morning Show"" packs a slightly weaker punch this time around, but it still doesn't merit cancellation."
The Morning Show,1,Cory reveals his vulnerable and humane side. Crudup's performance is among the show's best.
The Morning Show,1,"The writing is stronger than it was last season, and the all-star cast is as present and energetic as ever. It may not be the flagship show the streaming platform wanted, but there's promise of a sharper, tighter sophomore season here."
The Morning Show,1,"""The Morning Show"" most definitely succeeds at striking the balance between advancing its own personality-driven narrative and tackling topical issues in one entertaining drama."
The Morning Show,0,"If the first season was about the Me Too movement, the second season is about... well, I'm not sure really. The show says so much without saying anything at all."
The Morning Show,0,"After watching Season 2, I struggle to be certain what this show is about. The answer, at this point, really isn't ""a morning show."""
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
The Morning Show,1,"By the time the season gets going and all the bizarre twists start to kick in, it would be wrong to deny there's an appeal. An inaccurate medieval illustration of an elephant is still charming, after all."
The Morning Show,1,"Compelling performers and their interpersonal storylines make The Morning Show watchable, even as the series' lecturing threatens to push the audience out of reach."
The Morning Show,1,"This season's MVP, however, is undoubtedly Julianna Margulies, who joins the show as veteran anchor Laura Peterson via a particularly icy on-air interview."
The Morning Show,0,"Without the storyline that gave The Morning Show all its power and nuance, we are left with the old luxury fluff, reacquainting ourselves with characters who aren't substantial enough to merely hang out with."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
The Morning Show,0,"Why [It] feels so committed to giving Mitch's bland, predictable, ""old guard"" point of view equal weight to those of supposed gamechangers like Alex and Bradley is part of a larger problem surrounding the show's relationship to power."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
The Morning Show,1,"The first two episodes ease the audience back into this world and these juicy characters played to perfection by this ensemble. Episode three brings in the messy, ruthless world of UBA that we love to watch."
The Morning Show,1,"Those who liked the first season will probably liked this season too. For those who didn't, there's not much that'll convince them to come back. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Morning Show,0,"It wants us to be content to marvel at its framework of aspiration and drive, along with loving its two co-stars. After a point, though, the performances aren't enough of a reason to continue ignoring the story's lack of substance, guts and a soul."
The Morning Show,1,"The writing retains its high level of excellence, the series remains on the best in American TV."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
The Morning Show,1,"The acting, if not the dialogue, is terrific, and with a budget of $15 million per episode, Morning Wars looks as sleek as you'd expect."
The Morning Show,1,"The Morning Show is a camp masterpiece. Liberated from its previous desire to parse events in a meaningful way, it's become stranger and more fun."
The Morning Show,1,"The character work remains incredibly solid, particularly when it comes to the slippery, morally gray space most of these people operate in regarding their professional careers, but its pace remains glacial."
The Morning Show,0,"I'm not certain the show has anything to say, overall, about the news industry, about sexual abuse, about complicity, about cancel culture, or about workplace politics; so it has become one big time-filling mash of histrionics."
The Morning Show,1,"It's still shiny, but this time The Morning Show feels like it has more substance. It's confident and lighter on its feet."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
The Morning Show,1,"It's a show that is decadent in its self-absorption, much like the oversized characters it brings to life. Whether that decadence works for you is a personal choice, much like the real life news personalities we instinctively choose over the others."
The Morning Show,1,The Morning Show is still something of a luxurious mess. It's stronger when its characters guide the narrative... but feels trapped by its own fixation on real-world relevance.
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
The Morning Show,1,"It doesn't always succeed ... More frequently than not, however, the show fires on all cylinders, and it's a marvel to behold."
The Morning Show,0,The Morning Show once again fails to provide its stellar cast with compelling storylines or complex character development.
The Morning Show,1,"The laughs are fewer but sharper in this pandemic season of a dramedy series that takes on too much (bless it) but allows MVP's Aniston, Witherspoon, Carell and the sensationally soulless Crudup to create an irresistible chaos that's a pleasure to watch."
The Morning Show,1,"After watching all 10 episodes of season 2, I still have no idea whether the folks who make TMS believe it's Important TV or just high-priced melodrama. Either way, it's a lot more fun to watch this time around."
The Morning Show,1,The Morning Show still suffers from bloated episode run times but it looks amazing and often sounds amazing... This is one fun -- and sometimes bonkers -- show.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"As engaging a series as Attenborough has ever fronted, and one that's frequently astonishing."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Prehistoric Planet is visually ambitious, but the docuseries often fails to contextualize those visuals for the curious viewer."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"A gorgeous, engrossing look at the creatures who used to roam the earth."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Styled as a visually splendid nature documentary, this series explores the lives and times of dinosaurs in a remarkably realistic way."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Prehistoric Planet offers a remarkable blend of science and spectacle: it’s ‘filmed’ in such an immersive and tactile way, and the Cretaceous period is rendered with such intricacy and substance, that you'll forget dinosaurs are extinct."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"It means seeing a ferocious reptile rest at the surface and make derp face before it immediately starts to brawl with a younger male. This is peak entertainment, folks!"
Prehistoric Planet,1,Prehistoric Planet is an impressive technical docuseries that shows what life might have been like millions of years ago.
Prehistoric Planet,1,Prehistoric Planet is another success for Apple TV+ and a groundbreaking endeavour for the BBC’s Natural History department
Prehistoric Planet,1,"I didn’t think I needed a swimming T-Rex in my life, but now that I’ve seen it -- and now that Attenborough has talked me through the everyday trials and tribulations of your average meat-eating dino clan -- I don’t think I’ll ever be the same again."
Prehistoric Planet,1,It is so breathtaking that I often had to pinch myself to remember it wasn’t real. I have quite the sore arm.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"As one watches Prehistoric Planet, it is hard to come up with any word to describe the experience other than breathtaking."
Prehistoric Planet,1,A truly breathtaking display of CGI that feels authentic and looks like Apple TV+ sent a bold crew millions and millions of years into the past. Prehistoric Planet is a modern magic show.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Every bit as amazing as it promised to be, but troubling, too."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Apple's lavish nature documentary is a little difficult to follow, but breathtaking to behold."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"For family viewing with a bit of added educational value, this is liable to be a big hit."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"The amount of detail seen in the series makes you think that, surely, the creators had a plethora of live dinosaurs to observe -- that there’s no other way they could have known what these animals sounded like when they breathed."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Could the pacing of Prehistoric Planet be a little better? Sure. But the presentation of realistic-looking prehistoric animals in real-life environments is stunning to watch, especially for those with 4K TVs."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"It’s not perfect — some heads looked animatronic, and some of the herds had a decidedly animated feel. But those few visual misses were drowned out by the film’s meticulous attention to detail."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"It’s an impressive  and visually audacious feat to behold, one that gains more documentary cred from landing the highly regarded Sir David Attenborough as narrator."
Prehistoric Planet,1,Only a tech company with the financial resources of a medium-sized nation could achieve this. It's TV in a new league.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"A documentary composed of fictions, fictions composed of indisputable facts, a vision of a faraway past that could only be made using our knowledge of the present. A show like this is a kind of time travel."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"I’m not sure dinosaurs need their image rehabilitated, but seeing their existence and struggles laid out in familiar fashion does allow us to recognize that in the overall timeline of life on Earth, we’re not that far removed from them."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"By portraying them as they lived in their own time, Prehistoric Planet serves as a welcome reminder that the pop-culture vision of dinosaurs that has become magnified in the rear-view mirror goes beyond just the stuff of science fiction."
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Some of you may find the music a tad annoying, but for sheer creative effort and imagination it deserves five stars."
Prehistoric Planet,1,Prehistoric Planet is a stunning feat of CGI. The dinosaurs look as real as any animal you see in a wildlife documentary. This is the point.
Prehistoric Planet,1,Watching Prehistoric Planet has induced in me an existential – joy/delight? – that I don’t quite know what to do with.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"I can’t recommend it highly enough. Sit back, relax and bask in the reflected glory of monstrous beasts. (Spoiler: no humans are eaten.)"
Prehistoric Planet,1,Once you’ve researched and created these extraordinary creatures you have to give them something amusing to do. Prehistoric Planet does.
Prehistoric Planet,1,"Like ""Planet Earth,"" ""Prehistoric Planet"" aims to delight and surprise."
The Afterparty,1,"The cast is top-notch. The writing is clever. Surprises arrive frequently, and the throwaway gags — including the jokes involving Xavier's film career, cameos from other famous faces and magnificent 80s yacht-rock references included — are simply glorious"
The Afterparty,1,"Its worth accepting the invite to iThe Afterpartyi, even if you might not be the best party of your life. The performances are fun, particularly from Tiffany Haddish and Ben Schwartz."
The Afterparty,1,"Overall, ""The Afterparty"" may not be the most compelling whodunit, but it's funny and decidedly original. Its shortcomings stem from the same narrative ambition that informs its best and most creative parts."
The Afterparty,1,"Somehow, all these the different genres cohere into a show that's consistent, full of funny inside jokes, and, perhaps most remarkably of all, a compelling mystery."
The Afterparty,1,"Even when the gimmick threatens to overwhelm the narrative, theres plenty packed into those seven episodes to fuel endless debates and theories about the true identity of the killer."
The Afterparty,1,"be warned: the best way to watch is on a bit of a binge, for leaving weeks in between episodes means losing track of who is who and what is what and, thus, of whodunit."
The Afterparty,1,"Its only ever just good enough to ensure youll tune in for the next episode  once youve caught up on everything else, that is."
The Afterparty,1,The show carefully calibrates shtick and insight.
The Afterparty,1,"Stick with it even if Ep. 1 doesnt hook you. The pilot features multiple moments where physical humor doesnt connect, but I promise it gets better in a hurry. Youll be begging for new episodes after the hilarious musical genre of Ep. 3."
The Afterparty,1,"You barely know it’s happening to you, which is a good thing in our current perpetual state of crisis. Weightless distraction, with just enough happening onscreen so you can bear whatever else is going on in your life."
The Afterparty,1,Christopher Miller and company have captured magic in The Afterparty and have audiences on the edge of their seats with each new episode.
The Afterparty,1,"Boasting creative twists and great characters, this addictive, hilarious murder mystery is a gem."
The Afterparty,1,"The best part of The Afterparty premiere episodes is that the show is a comedy that ranges from the ridiculous and insane, to the very well-crafted joke here and there."
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
The Afterparty,1,The result of it all is one of the most enjoyable shows I’ve seen in a while. The story trickles out drip by drip with single events getting shown from multiple viewpoints...
The Afterparty,1,"Christopher Miller has created a truly hilarious murder mystery, something I never expected to write. This is a great show that I expect people to be buzzing about over the weeks to come."
The Afterparty,1,"Richardson, Schwartz and Chao find room for sweet interactions in all the confusion and panic and Haddish plays endless variations on bemused irritation."
The Afterparty,1,"It combines many of the things I love -- Agatha Christie-like murder mysteries, great comedies, scene-stealing comedic character actors, and wild-party/high-school reunion movies -- into one genuinely entertaining series."
The Afterparty,1,We are treated to parodies of these genres as their mind movies play out with scenes from the investigation interspersed throughout. The storytelling nature helps it all flow as clues and motivations are revealed.
The Afterparty,1,"""The Afterparty"" is a whodunit that understands the rules of the game well."
The Afterparty,1,"Smart, funny, and with a cast clearly having a ball, The Afterparty is a winner."
The Afterparty,1,"That trio of episodes, in addition to being frequently hilarious and clever, illustrates what sets the series apart: Each serving, while focusing on one character, also plays with a film genre, such as action or romantic comedy."
The Afterparty,1,The Afterparty on Apple TV+ is more comedy than mystery.
The Afterparty,1,"I'm not sure I care whodunit, but I'm enjoying the ride."
The Afterparty,1,The Afterparty is a witty satirical experiment so entertaining I'd be in favor a second season with a whole new reunion-murder.
The Afterparty,1,"We're off to a great start. Though not all of these characters are likable, they're definitely fun to watch."
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty is not only pretty funny, but it does a good job of poking fun at multiple movie genres while telling a whodunit that's not only hilarious but even a little intriguing."
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty features an all-star comedic ensemble and a genre-bending approach to its murder mystery, making it one of the most unique TV shows I've seen in a while."
The Afterparty,1,"Despite the different creative storytelling choices in each episode, there's a really cohesive feel to the show. It plays with the audience and what we think to be true when we see certain events happen slightly differently in each episode."
The Afterparty,1,Sam Richardson gets to shine as the lead and the one crime Ben Schwartz commits is stealing every scene he is in. There's plenty to enjoy in this comedy that deftly walks the line of its premise.
The Afterparty,0,"An Apple TV+ comedy series with one murder, plenty of suspects and minimal intrigue -- the sort of show that's modestly entertaining but doesn't bring enough to the party."
The Afterparty,1,"Only with the perfect talent involved can a comedy and murder mystery unfold simultaneously, and the talent is here, splendidly connected to the sheer weirdness of the material."
The Afterparty,1,"Given [its] A-list talent, it's not as consistently funny as one might expect, but there's simple joy in watching these people do what they do so well on a program that's buoyant, funny, and engaging."
The Afterparty,1,"In a time when comedic murder mysteries are having a moment (both with Hulu's ""Only Murders in the Building"" and Netflix's upcoming ""Murderville""), ""The Afterparty"" stands out as top tier on multiple fronts."
The Afterparty,0,"If this is the future of television, pass me the bottle."
The Afterparty,1,"The series' two best episodes, ""Yasper"" and ""Zoe,"" go all out...The other 5 episodes are still good, but given how the show excels when it truly commits, they feel vaguely like missed opportunities."
The Afterparty,1,"A fun, witty essay on the power of perception; how we see ourselves, how we think others see us and how they really see us. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Afterparty,1,"In concept and execution, it's impressively ambitious..."
The Afterparty,1,"It's as if the show's creators put 1997′s ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" in a blender with Agatha Christie and, voilà, may I interest you in ""The Afterparty""?"
The Afterparty,1,"Within its limited lane, The Afterparty delivers. It's pure, lively, slapstick fun..."
The Afterparty,1,"I don't think it's a great show, but I think it's a solid show, and I grew kind of fond of these people as they told their different stories."
The Afterparty,1,"It is busy with fun ideas and good performances, but lacking in pace."
The Afterparty,1,"Because each episode gives viewers a new genre it keeps things interesting, right up until the last second.The hilarious cast each bring something unique to this fun mystery."
The Afterparty,1,"An exceedingly delightful, cleverly constructed, adeptly acted comedy-mystery set around a 15-year high school reunion."
The Afterparty,1,"For all the formal flights of fancy into genre play, the central whodunit is what will keep you coming back."
The Afterparty,1,"For as much as the format trickery forms the spine of The Afterparty, the show becomes more intriguing and much funnier than it might've been thanks to the sharp actors embodying each different genre."
The Afterparty,1,"The inventive structure distinguishes The Afterparty, and the strong ensemble makes it all special."
The Afterparty,1,"Yes, this is a Rashomon-style of story that will have you laughing aloud as you try to put all the pieces of the puzzle together."
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty is a 7/10 show with a cast that'll make you wish it was a 9/10 show - it's good, but you can't help but be disappointed it's not that little bit better."
The Afterparty,1,It's like the adorable lovechild of Agatha Christie and Akira Kurosawa.
The Afterparty,1,"""Afterparty"" never takes itself too seriously and is filled with many lively and weird characters."
The Afterparty,1,"As a murder mystery it's only OK, but as a TV confection ""The Afterparty"" is a lot of fun."
The Afterparty,0,"While it will elicit a chuckle or two, The Afterparty relies too much on stereotypes and your existing attachment to the actors. Despite a clever premise, it's let down by weak writing and an over reliance on experimental storytelling devices."
The Afterparty,1,"It isn't revolutionary, but t's made with talent and a lot of love for the genres it embodies. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Afterparty,1,A fantastic script that fills every corner of the screen with visual gag after visual gag. [Full review in Spanish]
The Afterparty,1,"At its best The Afterparty is the meeting point of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon - the ultimate viewpoint-shifting crime story - with the self-referential, punchline-deferring humour of comedies such as Community and The Good Place."
The Afterparty,1,"Lord and Miller are among the most reliable names in the business for whip-smart meta-comedy, and this playlist-on-shuffle of genres so far seems to be up there with their best work - with a head-scratcher of a murder mystery to boot."
The Afterparty,1,...The Afterparty is one of the best new comedy series to arrive this year.
The Afterparty,1,"It's a murder-mystery parody, yes, but its primary focus is on playing with perspective and genre, resulting in a clever and charming ride that frequently serves up fun surprises."
The Afterparty,1,"In both subtle and outrageous ways, ""Afterparty"" is an enjoyable act of doing the same thing over as differently as possible - as best as you can get away with it."
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty takes elements from an Agatha Christie murder mystery and Rashomon-style storytelling and layers it with a comedic sheen. It works pretty well, too."
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
The Afterparty,1,The Afterparty shows that nothing is too difficult for Lord and Miller to accomplish in what is already one of the best TV debuts of 2022.
The Afterparty,1,"Apple TV+’s newest charmer exceeds even the loftiest of expectations as it delivers an uproarious, cleverly crafted murder mystery that’ll leave you wanting more."
The Afterparty,0,How does something with such sparky potential come to feel so strangely flat?
The Afterparty,1,"In the hands of creator and director Christopher Miller, Apple TV+'s The Afterparty takes this versatility and runs with it, creating one of the most entertaining shows of the young new year."
The Afterparty,1,Marvelous concoctions that demonstrate the creative ingenuity that remains possible in an episodic series.
The Afterparty,0,The series attempts to navigate a deceptively tricky balancing act between murder mystery and comedy.
The Afterparty,1,"The Afterparty is a class valedictorian at an all-night rager. It's smart, with thoughtful ideas to offer those who feel like engaging with them - but it's concerned first and foremost with having a good time."
Mythic Quest,1,"Mythic Quest is workplace comedy for the millennial generation, and it understands its audience well."
Mythic Quest,1,"With only 20 episodes so far, Mythic Quest has humanized Ian without losing how annoying he is. That's an impressive feat."
Mythic Quest,1,Season 2 sees Mythic Quest hitting its stride by combining quick-fire comedy with moments of real vulnerability and character growth.
Mythic Quest,1,"Writers Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, Ashly Burch and David Hornsby have taken what made Mythic Questwork, then expanded on a winning formula."
Mythic Quest,1,"The show is smart about the obvious gender politics at work here, beyond simply pointing out how hard it is for women to thrive in the tech bro world (though it hits this mark consistently, too)."
Mythic Quest,1,"If season 2 is indeed the final chapter in the saga of Ian, Poppy, and the MQ team, the series goes out on a high note."
Mythic Quest,1,"What Mythic Quest does so superbly is ground its zanier premise with these emotionally honest moments, particularly between Ian and Poppy, two high-strung high-achievers with bags and bags of vulnerabilities."
Mythic Quest,1,"It sets you up with the promise of typical comedic hijinks, and then packs quite an emotional punch when you least expect it. That's the cheat code to its appeal: just when it's being silly, it steals in a sneakily mature moment."
Mythic Quest,1,"Through [Charlotte Nicdao's Poppy Li], the writers of Mythic Quest are challenging cultural stereotypes about the kinds of women who get to get ahead in business"
Mythic Quest,1,"With some true gems over the course of Season 2, there's plenty of reason to put Mythic Quest in your weekly rotation."
Mythic Quest,1,Mythic Quest triumphs once again in a stupendous second season that is never too generous with laughs in a post-pandemic world. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mythic Quest,1,"Some of the developments are more successful than others, but that hit-or-miss quality doesn't detract from the overall giddiness of the nine episodes."
Mythic Quest,1,"People like this exist in workplaces, and unlike workplace comedies that have made them into adorkable icons, Mythic Quest makes audiences reckon with the vocational landscape."
Mythic Quest,1,"Mythic Quest suffers a bit in its need to make the majority of its cast likable, as well as like each other... This tension makes the new season a little less funny than the first, but there's still an edge there that's fresh."
Mythic Quest,1,"Season 2 is an uneven mess at times, but the good outweighs the bad mostly thanks to the great roster of characters and the talented actors behind them."
Mythic Quest,1,"Mythic Quest's Season 2 premiere is immediately more comfortable in its own skin, managing to kickstart a brand of comedy that's appropriately cynical while still finding ways to make us root for its characters."
Mythic Quest,1,"Too often there's something disposable about ""Mythic Quest,"" but those C.W. episodes nearly broke me. It's a tremendous achievement buried inside something that has the potential to be so much more."
Mythic Quest,1,"Even when Mythic Quest slips sometimes, I continue to love the show for how seriously it invests in the hard questions of creative work."
Mythic Quest,1,"After a season introducing the cast and trying out different dynamics, Season 2 sees the writing team pulling almost all the right levers."
Mythic Quest,1,They're enriching their own universe and playing off each other and actually trying to tell human stories.
Mythic Quest,1,"While ""Everlight"" is a tough episode to top, ""Titans' Rift"" is an excellent season premiere."
Mythic Quest,1,They're endlessly nagging questions that leave people second guessing themselves on a daily basis. Yet this season Mythic Quest has found a way to explore these headaches without ever once compromising on humor or emotion.
Mythic Quest,1,"I've never been a fan of video games, but I'm sold on the sardonic silliness of Mythic Quest."
Mythic Quest,1,A joy to watch with its razor-sharp writing and outstanding performances that illuminate these lovably weird characters at every turn.
Mythic Quest,1,"Mythic Quest continues to level up in Season Two, even with the characters all back in the office together. It's now a consistently funny show, on top of an emotionally effective one."
Mythic Quest,1,"The excellent three-episode run in the second season of ""Mythic Quest"" is a joyful reminder of how strong this comedy can be when it's really clicking."
Mythic Quest,1,The cast remains top-notch and the ensemble does a good job milking their characters' foibles for laughs without taking things too far.
Mythic Quest,1,"I don't know how to explain it, but Mythic Quest is so much more than just a workplace comedy. It's a journey that highlights elements of empathy and vulnerability through a cast that knows how to garner laughs and emotional responses."
Mythic Quest,1,A major upgrade from the first season -- which was already great -- and deserves to stand out as one of the best comedies across streaming platforms and on television today.
Mythic Quest,1,"Mythic Quest excels at finding deeper and nastier ways at cutting its cast, and its fans, to their cores."
Mythic Quest,1,"The show seems more focused on going for the heart than consistent laughs. It gets away with it because of the deep bench of great performances, and how it takes the workplace sitcom into new, diverse areas. I just wish it...level up its comedy stats."
Mythic Quest,1,Fantastic follow up to the first season that allows the viewers to get to know the characters even more. Hilarious and better than the first!
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Herschkoph is inherently unlikable, decidedly shifty and lacking in moral fiber, while Markowitz simply misses a backbone. Epiphanies, gumption or redeemable characteristics are in short supply, meaning there is little to get behind as a viewer."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Rudd, Ferrell and Hahn's charismatic presences are only thing that prevents a fall into a predictable monotony. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd have terrific chemistry in performances that could have skewed grim, lightening up a chilling premise."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It never gains any momentum, and despite the presence of Ferrell and Rudd, it all feels sadly underwhelming."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
The Shrink Next Door,0,This is a staggeringly huge misfire.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"What begins as a twisted buddy show soon takes a deep dive into the dark, shocking pool of manipulation and scheming. It spins a fun web of lies, discomfort and lots of stingingly hilarious lines of dialogue."
The Shrink Next Door,1,The Shrink Next Door is a disturbing and tragic story of trust being abused. It explores the dark side of greed and manipulation.
The Shrink Next Door,1,The Shrink Next Door is a consistently beguiling series that pushes Rudd and Ferrell as actors in ways we've never seen before.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"As compelling as the real story may be, the early episodes of the series which were released to the press, are underwhelming..."
The Shrink Next Door,1,Works better than it should because of how keenly the cast capture the personalities of their characters.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"It's a methodically paced, odd but mesmerizing piece set to an infectious soundtrack highlighted by its strategic use of '80s soft rock hits. Besides, the cast hoists the show over and through its slack spots."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I have to say, it's a downer of an introduction, and one that has dulled any anticipation for the next installment."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The execution of the story doesn't feel balanced as an eight-episode series. It's oddly surface level at the same time never diving into the nuance or the complexities of how this could have happened.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Maybe a different creative team could've done a better job adapting The Shrink Next Door, or maybe Marty Markowitz's story simply didn't need to be retold."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"As it stands, the show presents the fictionalized highlights of Markowitz and Herschkopf's story in a compelling enough manner to give watchers a decent helping of literal psychological drama."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The Shrink Next Door gives Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, and Kathryn Hahn some outside-the-box characters to play, but the rinse/repeat abuse dynamic of Ike and Marty becomes an exceptionally tedious watch by series end. I"
The Shrink Next Door,1,Rudd's boyish charisma is so pervasive he almost makes you believe there's affection for Marty beneath Dr. Ike's passive-aggressive manipulations...
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The way Ike silkily asserts control over Marty's life, and why Marty was susceptible to it, is a key element to all of this. But the show's approach is weirdly miscalculated."
The Shrink Next Door,1,What a story! Yikes!
The Shrink Next Door,0,Herein lies the central problem with The Shrink Next Door. It's not interesting to watch someone avoid conflict.
The Shrink Next Door,0,The majority of The Shrink Next Door evokes too much cringe to be sustainably enjoyable.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The show depends to a large degree on our knowing that this crazy thing really did happen, kinda sorta in this way. At the same time, with all such adaptations, it is cramped by that dependency..."
The Shrink Next Door,1,The sheer size and nerve of the three-decade scam will keep you going to the end.
The Shrink Next Door,0,Amounts to less than the sum of its ambitious parts; intriguing moments of acting and casting that somehow fail to reveal a surprising or enlightening tale.
The Shrink Next Door,1,It would all seem a tad daft and overblown if it wasn't for the fact that it all really happened. Just with a less attractive psychiatrist.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Ferrell's timid, clipped, kvetching voice and tentative body language is some of his most subtle work."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"An unbelievable cautionary tale that takes it's time, but delivers by the end. The ""how deep & far can this go?"" keeps you hooked. A tragedy with sprinkle of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Both playing nicely against type, Paul Rudd portrays the unscrupulous psychiatrist and Will Ferrell is the insecure man he exploits."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The series rapidly hops between decades but feels like it moves at a crawl, dulling the myriad charms of its leading cast."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Disturbing - and not in an entertaining way.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"If you watch The Shrink Next Door as a showcase for two extraordinary actors, you will likely have a great viewing experience. I certainly did."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Though the performances are uniformly terrific -- Ferrell has to walk the highest tightrope, making Marty believable but not too pathetic -- The Shrink Next Door is Exhibit A in streaming series bloat. There's not enough story to justify eight episodes."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The three main characters and actors couldn't be more fascinating to behold while the writing and directing is snappy, shrewd and filled with wry little details that later have a big impact."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Another great podcast adaptation after Dr Death. Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd & Kathryn Hahn all deliver fantastic nuanced performances in a very well written, interesting show."
The Shrink Next Door,0,A drawn-out true-cringe story.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The story is undoubtedly compelling but, given how swiftly the doctor-patient boundaries are breached, you wonder how The Shrink Next Door can sustain the dramatic tension across eight episodes."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The Shrink Next Door may lack the urgency of a true-crime binge watch but the story finds unsettling ways to seep in, making it one of this fall's must-see series."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The Shrink Next Door has fine performances, darkly comic moments and one of the funniest bar-mitzvah scenes you'll ever see."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Won't leave you smiling at the end, but the story is fascinating, sad and no matter how uncomfortable it might make the viewer, you can't look away."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"It's a slow burn, and not exactly a barrel of laughs along the way, but it is strangely engaging throughout, getting scammier and more uncomfortable with each passing episode. The Shrink Next Door Kathryn HahnIt helps that all three stars are superb."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Watching the story unfold, as Rudd's psychiatrist manipulates Ferrell's patient utterly and completely over the course of decades,is sometimes like scraping your knuckles on a cheese grater."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"The script can occasionally be toothless in that you're never sure whether to laugh or cringe and it takes time getting accustomed to Ferrell's shockingly restrained performance, but ""The Shrink Next Door"" moves with subtle unpredictability."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"A heartbreakingly funny story, delivering pathos and discomfort as only brilliant comedic performers can."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Ike Herschkopf is Paul Rudd's Tom Ripley. Rudd taps into his own charm and that mischievous nature but poisons it with Ike's greed and selfishness, and Ike's ambition to be liked and admired is both tragic and unsettling."
The Shrink Next Door,1,There is solid acting from these two performers as well as the supporting cast best known for their comedic work but it is buried under too much filler.
The Shrink Next Door,1,"While eight episodes is a long stretch to follow such a slow-moving trainwreck of psychological abuse, that kind of low sizzle is what makes The Shrink Next Door's grander tragedy stand out among the droll laughs."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The Shrink Next Door has plenty of star power but can't get past its confused narrative, disappointing lack of character development, and dragging pace."
The Shrink Next Door,1,Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd play to their strengths ... revealing effective dramatic elements that are woven into the comic fiber that is the show's greatest strength.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"""Something something daddy issues"" is a perilously slender thread from which to hang an entire scripted drama, and perhaps that's why the show feels so sterile."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"[It's] the one thing its protagonist always untruthfully claims and wishes he is: forgettably, plainly fine."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The premise sounds so simple and fruitful. But despite all the talent involved, the result is confusing, landing in a no-man's-land between comedy, drama and thriller."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"""The Shrink Next Door"" strikes a few chords over eight episodes and holds your interest throughout..."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"No expense was spared in building sets and procuring costumes that make the socioeconomic details of this story come through crisply, but both characters are, in the end, ciphers."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"Even for those familiar only with the broad strokes of what real-life Marty Markowitz went through, the series presents the frustrating case with great detail and insight."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
The Shrink Next Door,1,"A compelling and crushing story, ""The Shrink Next Door"" is a riveting look at flawed humanity, companionship, greed and the cost of self-worth."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
Defending Jacob,1,A great Apple TV + production. [Full review in Spanish]
Defending Jacob,1,"[Martell] epitomizes the bullied teens of the post-Columbine era, social outcasts that seek refuge in violent video games, playing out fantasies on dark websites and tortured by their peers on social media."
Defending Jacob,1,A good show whose premise ends up being secondary as more profound (and relevant) themes are explored. [Full review in Spanish].
Defending Jacob,1,"The show can drag a bit, but the performances are absolutely great."
Defending Jacob,1,"It's a mixture of courtroom drama, murder mystery, and psychological thriller, and if it sometimes falls back on familiar genre-ish cliches, the show can boast some fine performances and possesses the critical ingredient of watchability."
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob is a crime thriller mini-series that will certainly keep you guessing about what actually happened. A little bit of a slow burn, but worth it in the end."
Defending Jacob,1,"Perhaps its dour tone would have bothered me less if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic, but that's just the world we live in. As such, I would say that Defending Jacob is worth a watch, just be aware of what you're getting into."
Defending Jacob,1,"The ambiguous ending to the eight-part series is a bit frustrating, but it sets the stage for a possible second season."
Defending Jacob,1,"The show's strength lies within its exploration of family, grief, and desperation."
Defending Jacob,1,"Approached as a crime drama, Defending Jacob might seem a little slow and underbaked, but as an ensemble character piece it hits the mark."
Defending Jacob,1,"Perfectly structured to deliver revelation after revelation right up to the end, it's deliciously infuriating and ambiguous, with a gut punch closer it would be hard to see coming, leaving you with much to mull over."
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob is a mostly successful show, driven by strong performances across the board and mystery narrative that holds audience interest, despite a few stumbles."
Defending Jacob,1,"Book-based crime drama has violence, cursing."
Defending Jacob,1,It may be a slow burn but there are reasons enough to keep going.
Defending Jacob,1,"One of the most addicting shows I've seen this year with memorable performances from Chris Evans and Michelle Dockery, especially. Defending Jacob is not one to miss on Apple TV+."
Defending Jacob,1,"A gripping, well-produced and directed, legal drama that will keep you guessing until the end. Chris Evans is great here, flexing his dramatic chops. [Full review in Spanish]"
Defending Jacob,1,"The director applies an autumnal hue, with a color range of frosty blues that really adjusts to the atmosphere of slowly crumbling feelings. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Defending Jacob,1,"It's a slow-moving deep sigh of a dramatic series, but it's easy to relax into its rhythms. It's bleak, but in the way that a page-turning murder mystery is."
Defending Jacob,1,"What really hooks you are the relatable characters, superbly played by the terrific cast. Come for the mystery, stay for the drama. [Full review in Spanish]"
Defending Jacob,1,Apple TV+ may have just delivered America's answer to Broadchurch.
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob is a slow burn crime drama featuring twists & turns which are gradually revealed throughout, I just wish they'd come around a little faster."
Defending Jacob,1,"[T]his crime-and-courtroom murder mystery boasts a filmic quality, high production values, a moody atmosphere and enough twists and secrets to keep you guessing till the next episode's reveal."
Defending Jacob,1,"Stretched out a bit too long, Defending Jacob still offers smart entertainment that keeps the audience in suspense. I do wish it was more family friendly."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob never really comes to life...
Defending Jacob,1,You will love watching the episodes but after it is over you won't feel very good about it.
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob finds its best form in exposing those family cracks, latent in everyday life, which then explode with crime. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Defending Jacob,0,Underneath this tale... is pretty standard fare and about two hundred minutes too long.
Defending Jacob,1,Director Morten Tyldum and showrunner Mark Bomback are successfully able to turn William Landay's novel into an entertaining piece of television with slick direction and engaging scripts.
Defending Jacob,1,It's a crisply tailored crime and courtroom mystery designed to keep its audience guessing while also highlighting the cast's performances.
Defending Jacob,1,"One thing that's evident from the outset is that all of the actors are perfect for their roles. Jaeden Martell, in particular, is still a young actor, but he handles the dark material with ease, and I appreciated the way the journey began with him."
Defending Jacob,1,"Very entertaining mystery melodrama. Evans, Dockery & Martell all bring their A-Game. My only complaint: this is a show to be binged, and Apple isn't letting viewers do that."
Defending Jacob,0,"In the pantheon of Massachusetts-set entertainments, ""Defending Jacob"" falls somewhere between Mark Wahlberg's godawful ""Spenser Confidential"" and Kenneth Lonergan's flawless ""Manchester by the Sea."""
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob has merits. It's unhurried to the point of being dourly focused, and it looks stunning."
Defending Jacob,1,It's a well-done drama that will keep you guessing and entertained and thinking about it even when you're not watching it.
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is a story that feels both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Like its namesake, Defending Jacob is brought down just as it's taking off."
Defending Jacob,0,"Part legal thriller, part whodunnit, the eight-part series stars an A-list cast, adheres to familiar crime genre convention and steps so carefully toward the finale reveal that it often feels more sleepy than suspenseful."
Defending Jacob,1,"Mission mostly accomplished: the acting is strong, the music is effectively forbidding, Cherry Jones plays a lawyer. That's all good, and makes Defending Jacob a worthy little binge for these stuck-at-home times."
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob is not bad so much as the result of what happens when you try to reverse-engineer a bestseller into a conversation-starter, and prestige-TV it to death."
Defending Jacob,0,Perhaps the biggest crime committed in Defending Jacob is that the elements to make this series pop are all there; they just weren't executed properly.
Defending Jacob,1,"Intriguing story, solid performances, and production values. Well worth the time."
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob suffers greatly from its format, stretching 120 minutes of story max into eight hours of episodic television."
Defending Jacob,1,"The pilot does a remarkable job of building up the situation and its main players, but leaving enough in a nebulous spot that there's still some doubt and some questions to dig deeper into."
Defending Jacob,1,"Defending Jacob is a clever little thriller. It boasts the slickness that Apple originals have come to be defined by, but sadly, the service still hasn't found that one piece of programming that it can flash as its calling card."
Defending Jacob,1,"Evans and Dockery deliver strong performances that, along with the rest of the cast, ultimately make the series worthwhile."
Defending Jacob,1,"Chris Evans does some of the best work of his career as Andy... He expertly conveys Andy's desperate, ferocious need to protect his son, his genuine love for his wife - and the haunting memories that jolt him awake in the middle of the night."
Defending Jacob,0,"""Defending Jacob"" has great ingredients, but the portion size is off."
Defending Jacob,1,"Well cast and twisty, it's an earnest if mostly undistinguished effort, one that relies heavily on the one-time Avenger's star power in serving its mission to bring viewers to Apple TV+."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is imitation-flavored television - a chronic occurrence, six months after the streaming service's launch. There's a larger mystery there, and someone needs to solve it."
Defending Jacob,1,"You've seen it before, perhaps, but don't let that stop you. ""Defending Jacob..."" is gripping enough in its own way, despite some of the familiar moves, and the acting is consistently fine."
Defending Jacob,0,"Better to leave audiences craving more than demanding less, I suppose, but Defending Jacob boasts a tremendous ensemble of actors who make you wish they had the rich characterizations they deserve."
Defending Jacob,0,"For a show so devoted to stringing you along for answers, ""Defending Jacob"" doesn't leave you with much once it's over."
Defending Jacob,1,"It's a story of the torment of enduring suspicion, seductive in its detail, abetted by a thriller-sized plot twist, and worth all the fatigue its eight hours of uncertainty can induce."
Defending Jacob,1,The high-profile names involved and impressive production are what really separate it from your standard basic cable crime dramas and not necessarily the content itself.
Defending Jacob,0,All the ingredients are in place to make Defending Jacob one of the year's best shows. Instead it's an average outing into an already crowded medium. And that's kind of indefensible.
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob comes close to being good, but it relies too heavily on melodrama and never delivers the emotion the heavy subject matter deserves."
Defending Jacob,0,The worst thing about Apple TV+'s new limited series Defending Jacob is that it feels like every other crime series we've seen before.
Defending Jacob,1,"An exceptionally enthralling ride filled with tense scenes, astounding performances, well-written characters, and an unpredictable outcome!"
Defending Jacob,1,"Despite the limited performances of Dockery and Evans, Cherry Jones, as the boy's attorney, and J.K. Simmons, as his grandfather, offer outstanding supporting performances."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion still doesnt seem to know exactly what its saying, repurposing its more political source material into a series of middle-of-the-road thriller beats that are never as gripping as they aim to be."
Suspicion,1,"Dark, driving, and addictive, this thriller casts a keen eye on modern-day surveillance and social media."
Suspicion,0,Suspicion is a show consistently filled with incident it can sometimes trick you into thinking it is complex.
Suspicion,1,"In an information age where attention spans are short, distractions are abundant, and deep fake footage defines the culture, this abduction is clever stuff."
Suspicion,1,This isn't a bad thing at all; it makes Suspicion feel new and different from other investigative thrillers.
Suspicion,0,"The cast is appealing, but Thurman lacks energy to the point where she seems almost glazed."
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
Suspicion,0,"By the time you reach the series end, the genre pleasures and the politics have gotten so tangled together and muddled that its hard to care either what happens to the characters, or what the series is trying to say."
Suspicion,1,The pace remains quick but the action remains coherent... Quickly engrossing.
Suspicion,0,“Suspicion” is another Peak TV offering where the idea gets outdone by the need to break it up into too many pieces that can get tiresome trying to fit together.
Suspicion,1,"I have a suspicion of my own, and its that you will love it! It's smarter than your usual kidnapping thriller."
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
Suspicion,0,"It brings to mind an important lesson: television works when it uses the storytelling tools at its disposal, rather than just hacking a story into pieces and expecting viewers to follow it."
Suspicion,1,"At the end of the day, Suspicion has all of the elements that make up a solid show: complex characters, an intriguing mystery, and performances that do a great job of enhancing the story... Where it falls short is in how it balances itself."
Suspicion,1,"What you’ve got instead of a drama built around one leading character, is a tense, involving thriller that requires your concentration, but rewards it."
Suspicion,1,"Sometimes, nothing hits the spot quite like a well-paced TV thriller."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Suspicion,0,"There are bare minimum levels of intrigue, and fans of the genre might even enjoy the ride, but Suspicion has nothing to offer besides an average suspense story."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion is convinced of its own cleverness and righteousness, but very little over the course of its eight episodes provides any evidence for either."
Suspicion,1,"If it isn’t a show you need to put straight on your must-see list, it does stand as an exemplar of everything that’s good – and bad – about big-league streaming TV in 2021."
Suspicion,1,Follows the “24” playbook: Count on breathless excitement and engaging characters to outrun any gaps in logic.
Suspicion,1,"If it never becomes more than a jigsaw – done by others, you just sit back and watch the picture take shape – that’s OK. It never promised to be anything else."
Suspicion,1,"This is political-thriller territory of a special kind, as riveting as it is complex."
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
Suspicion,1,"...Scratches a very particular itch, emitting vibes that are perhaps best described as ""90s paranoiac thriller starring Will Smith and Gene Hackman or maybe Sandra Bullock and the Internet."""
Suspicion,0,"This viewer simply lost the patience waiting for the show to allow Thurman, a gifted performer who too rarely gets the chance to let loose these days, to do much of anything."
Suspicion,1,"If you get through the initial stodge, you'll find a tense, mindless thriller."
Invasion,0,"A slow-moving, often tedious disaster drama, Invasion takes five episodes to get through what a blockbuster movie might take care of in half an hour."
Invasion,1,"Some Sci-Fi fans will be disappointed. Don't expect spectacular space battles, to witness landmark buildings get destroyed, or terrifying monsters running amok.  [Full review in Spanish]"
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
Invasion,1,The fact that it gives this many characters time to actually shine and develop by leaning more towards emotional drama rather than spectacle is the show's biggest grab.
Invasion,1,"A decidedly slow burn, but for those who tune in more interested in stories about people than in stories about boom crash aliens, it's a nice change of pace."
Invasion,1,"Invasion is invested more in its flavorless wheelspinning than the curiosity, fear, and panic that should come from an alien invasion."
Invasion,1,"It has fully realized characters, solid acting (Neill and Farahani always bring it) and a building dread."
Invasion,1,"There is so much unexplained in those first three episodes, and so many cliffhangers we can't wait to see resolved."
Invasion,0,"While it's an ambitious, sometimes welcome subversion of the genre, the approach often works to the series' detriment."
Invasion,1,"The first three installments as a block, though, pay off nicely, because by episode four, even the most sci-fi agnostic will be pulled in by some breakout performances and character development."
Invasion,0,"And aside from rhyming with Foundation which premiered last month, Invasion asks a similar question: Do you have time for this?"
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
Invasion,1,"There is enough vaguely intriguing mystery, patient atmosphere-building and big-budget sheen here to ensure that the show remains entirely watchable despite some loose-change characterisations and plotting."
Invasion,1,"The problem is that bigness again. In a bid to tell a sweeping story for all mankind (to borrow another strong Apple TV+ title), Invasion takes hours, literally, to get to the invasion."
Invasion,0,"The series is determined to tell, not show-relying on shots of people fleeing in terror or gaping at something offscreen, and waiting until the midseason mark to provide the first glimpse at what has everyone on the run."
Invasion,0,"Invasion is a ten-hour season devoid of nearly all humor, where characters across the globe continually bumble around in their own misery, resentful that aliens keep interrupting their tragic lives."
Invasion,0,"""Invasion"" always feels like it's using each far-flung story as a checklist."
Invasion,0,"Individually, none of the subplots builds to anything shaped by the careful arcing of a good short story, much less to anything that gives you reason to invest in the main characters."
Invasion,0,"It's sophisticated, visually excellent, but doesn't quite hit the mark. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slow burn that threatens to become simply slow.
Invasion,1,"It is at times an enchanting, moving drama about love's mysteries, not at all about the gross, fear-inducing spectacle of monstrous invaders."
Invasion,0,Perhaps Invasion is a worthy and ingenious effort to subvert the conventions of apocalyptic sci-fi. Or maybe it's just a flop.
Invasion,1,"We're on board with Invasion because of its performances and cinematic look. We're just concerned that there won't be any there there, and the show will spend its first season spinning its wheels more than advancing its story."
Invasion,1,"The slow-burn reveal was worth it. Not only are the aliens unexpected and scary, but their arrival also makes almost every character's arc more interesting."
Invasion,0,"Take away the aliens, and what's left is essentially the sprawling network family drama series This Is Us."
Invasion,0,"It's unclear whether these alien visitors have all the time in the world waiting around for somebody to get to the point, but a lot of us mere mortals don't."
Invasion,0,"Rather than so much as utter the word ""alien"" in these initial episodes, Invasion focuses on the global ripple effects of increasing panic -- which might be fine, if it also did a decent job developing its many characters along the way."
Invasion,1,"'Invasion' invades your hearts and minds with its character-driven narrative and strong themes of community, loss, fear, exile, power and love."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
Invasion,0,"For all that money, we might have expected more. The plotting is occasionally a letdown too, bordering on infuriating."
Invasion,1,A refreshing and often thrilling juggling of plot-threads that involve incredibly flawed or hurtful decisions made in the name of survival.
Invasion,1,This is one alien invasion show that couldn't be less about aliens - and is all the better for it.
Invasion,1,"Those looking to meet some scary aliens might be frustrated by the slice-of-life drama that dominates the premiere, but the show seems to be improving over time, making it worth sticking around to see how all the pieces come together."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Invasion,0,"Perhaps it's simply that I've watched Independence Day too many times, but there's nothing about this show that's even particularly enjoyable, let alone fun."
Invasion,1,Believe me when I say there is at least one jaw-dropping moment in each episode that will leave you gasping.
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
Invasion,1,Takes a different approach than what I've seen before.
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slog - and not a particularly enjoyable one at that.
Acapulco,1,"For an amiable half-hour slice of dramedy, it's certainly serviceable entertainment, just calibrate your expectations accordingly before checking in."
Acapulco,1,The good-natured show's protagonist portrayed by Enrique Arrizon exudes innocence and optimism. It's a great companion to Ted Lasso. The 80s music is played to hilarious comedic effect. And finally a show that represents Mexicans properly.
Acapulco,1,"The characters are likable, even when in conflict, because they care genuinely for others."
Acapulco,1,"Sweet, gentle and filled with likable characters."
Acapulco,1,"The character-driven story will lure you in, especially because the characters are so well-written and acted."
Acapulco,1,"Acapulco is, at its core, wholesome and genuinely feelgood television. And that makes me feel, oh, I don't know, sort of anxious."
Acapulco,1,"Through it all, though, ""Acapulco"" is a skillful comedy, too. There's a strain of tenderhearted goofiness to go along with some very funny setups."
Acapulco,1,"Acapulco allows these tensions to rise naturally-never forcing a happy resolution, but also not belaboring the friction. It's a well-balanced show with an endearing lead performance and a whole roster of equally charming supporting players."
Acapulco,1,"Drama aside, the overall effect is gentle, sunny and laidback, and the show wears its easy charm well. Acapulco doesn't reinvent the wheel, but Las Colinas is a most pleasant place to spend some time."
Acapulco,1,"The amiable cast carries the narrative through its lack of real urgency, with Arrizon and Perez delivering pleasant chemistry, Collins, Overstreet and Carsa providing humor and Alcázar and Bauche contributing some emotional grounding."
Acapulco,1,A surprisingly charming trip back in time to the Mexican resort town in the 1980s.
Acapulco,1,The first episode of Acapulco shows a funny series with some charisma but nothing extraordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
Acapulco,1,"Acapulco has a ton of heart, plenty of humour and looks stunning. Told in Spanish and English, this coming-of-age story doesn't set out to break barriers or be scintillating. It anchors itself in seductive cuteness and succeeds."
Acapulco,1,"On the whole, Acapulco feels like a satisfying enough scripted destination, albeit the kind its biggest name had to wait for American television to be ready to make."
Acapulco,1,"On paper, this might not sound like a whole lot of fun. But Acapulco boasts enough sharp characterizations to make its gentle screwball comedy ping pong around the hotel with effervescent ease."
Dickinson,1,"In probing this riddle, Dickinson pushed the boundaries of anachronistic storytelling-and became one of the most audacious series on TV."
Dickinson,1,"Whenever Dickinson takes grand license with its heroine's history my appreciation for this show is renewed. It's one of those sparkling gems that's likely to be appreciated more broadly in its afterlife, especially as Steinfeld's stardom grows."
Dickinson,1,Dickinson reaches brilliant and mature heights in its exploration of a unique voice. [Full review in Spanish]
Dickinson,1,"With the Civil War as its backdrop, and parallels to our current mid-pandemic world, the end of this incredibly nuanced and well-written show is superb. I will miss it a lot."
Dickinson,1,"It's doubtful Dickinson Season 3 will convert any new subscribers to AppleTV+. Still, the final season provides a strong salute to wartime poet Emily Dickinson."
Dickinson,1,"Our series, via Em's voice-over, wants to assert that Dickinson has been sidelined from the canon of war poets for all the reasons you might expect: (1) not being a soldier, (2) being a shut-in, and (3) being a woman."
Dickinson,1,"The supporting cast is still stellar bedrock for Hailee Steinfeld performance, which is growing deeper and sharper with the character's own development as an artist."
Dickinson,1,"The ending is pitch perfect, and I'm grateful those behind the scenes decided to leave on a high and leave us wanting more."
Dickinson,1,Unquestionably a phenomenal final season...
Dickinson,1,"Back for its final season, the first three episodes of Dickinson Season Three are a promising start to what I hope will be a satisfying season of one of television's most inventive shows."
Dickinson,1,It doesn't matter how closely this portrayal aligns with the real Dickinson; what matters is that she toohas moved audiences with her art.
Dickinson,1,Dickinson has quietly perfected a mix of sitcom and sincerity in its final season...
Dickinson,1,"A tightly-written journey that will grab your attention from the first scene until the last. Many TV shows end a few seasons too late, but the stars align for Dickinson to conclude with one of the most satisfying final seasons I have watched in my life."
Dickinson,1,"Dickinson's final season is shaping up to be its best yet, and, as much as I don't want this ride to end, I can't wait to see what transpires next."
Dickinson,1,"It's a scene that's a wonderful example of what Dickinson has deftly been able to do over its short but sweet run on Apple TV+, melding the absurd with the morbid."
Dickinson,1,"Rooted in an intelligent, wild, sensuous performance from Steinfeld, Dickinson remixes facts, hypotheses, rumors and daydreams about the famously reclusive poet's life into a buoyantly implausible family dramedy."
Dickinson,1,"Over three seasons, audiences watched Emily fight to be a writer, fight to be published, and now fight to know if her writing changed the world. It did and does, partly through the show's very existence."
Dickinson,1,"'Dickinson' is a treasure chest of fun and brilliance, and its third season shines right at the top."
Dickinson,1,"Vital and independent, 'Dickinson' reflects upon the very best of what people are capable of doing,"
Dickinson,1,"Sharp and irreverent, weird and sexy, and just anachronistic enough to have something to say without getting tiresome, Dickinson has been wholly and idiosyncratically itself since the day it premiered."
Dickinson,1,"Feels as sharp and clear-eyed in its final installment as it did in its first, bringing its story to a rich and satisfying -- if somewhat bittersweet -- conclusion, even if some of us (read: me) wish it could go on forever."
Dickinson,1,"As usual the beauty and power of Emily's poetry infuses every moment of the episodes, lifting the storytelling to ethereal heights and redeeming the characters in their darkest times."
Dickinson,1,"With its final season, Dickinson accomplishes what feels impossible: it balances the tricky work of preserving the mystery of Emily Dickinson while giving us a peek into the life of one of the world's most reclusive poets."
Calls,1,Calls has come at the right time. [Full Review in Spanish]
Calls,1,Calls is a thrilling and highly entertaining viewing experience that brings an experimental format to English-speaking audiences.
Calls,1,"Experienced as either an ensemble piece or individual act one plays, Calls is consistently satisfying and never outstays its welcome."
Calls,1,"When Calls is locked in, it's an especially effective slice of horror. That usually comes when the show sticks to the ""less is more"" side of things."
Calls,1,"This would have made a great episode of The Twilight Zone, the eeriness and appalling nature of the chap's predicament lingering with you for days."
Calls,1,"The fact that each call tells a different story is enough to keep this feeling fresh and immeasurably compelling. Disorienting and frightening, the concept of this show is unconventional."
Calls,1,"Based on the French series of the same name, the star-studded scifi thriller series Calls is genuinely exciting television."
Calls,1,"If you're a fan of mind-benders (and Calls is inherently mind-bending, as from the start it asks you to deprioritise the sense of sight) then you're in for a treat."
Calls,1,A TV show that doesn't show you what's happening turns out to be surprisingly effective for horrific stories.
Calls,1,"Calls is instantly compelling as telephone calls between people in different parts of the US begin to paint a picture of a terrifying space-time anomaly and a more immediate, throat-ripping kind of menace."
Calls,1,"While the audio is the focus of the production, what's intriguing about this otherwise good-but-not-great story is that it has some of the charm and simplicity of audio-only storytelling, with some of the advantages of visual cues."
Calls,1,"The nightmares in our heads are scarier than any monster conjured up on screen. For the mind is susceptible to suggestion and ripe for manipulation. If only the stories were more fresh, Calls could have been a fine advertisement for audio storytelling."
Calls,1,"Calls is a uniquely emotional and alarming experience. It's a very effective sci-fi horror yarn that, at its best, will give viewers some good ghastly gotchas while skillfully threading all its chapters together into one scary story."
Calls,1,Wholly immersive and totally chilling.
Calls,0,"Truly, Calls is a collection of choices that I mostly just don't understand."
Calls,1,Will chill you for days.
Calls,1,"""Calls"" works in part because it represents a change of pace, built around the notion that the horrors conjured by our imagination often surpass anything that millions of dollars in special effects can visualize."
Calls,1,"Asking viewers to suspend their existing notions of all these concepts as they watch to the stories play out is what makes a show like Calls so deliciously engaging - if, and it's a big, important if, you can get past the quirks of the format."
Calls,1,"I fully did not expect to cry and laugh and scream all within the span of one show, and yet that's exactly what these episodes did. It's a fascinating way of storytelling, and I hope that others enjoy Calls as much as I did."
Calls,1,"Somehow, despite not a single actor appearing on screen, Calls manages to be one of the best-acted and well-executed series of the last few years. And it is going to freak you out."
Home Before Dark,1,"Home Before Dark deserves more seasons, for the magic and mystery it crafts but also because of a cast that gives their all to a story that pulls out all the stops."
Home Before Dark,1,"With all of our favorite characters firmly entrenched in the latest Erie Harbor mystery, or perhaps a continuation of the last mystery, it's time to dive into the unique intrigue that is Home Before Dark."
Home Before Dark,1,"This is a family show that makes every member of the family think about their place in the world, and what they can do about it."
Home Before Dark,1,"It's not exactly an Amblin feel, but it's in that ballpark - it's a murder mystery, but it has a sense of wonder and a delightfully precocious kid that even adults can look up to."
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
Truth Be Told,1,"It was hard not to be worried about the series because the only character that got some marked progression in the initial half of the premiere was Poppy, who Octavia Spencer continues to play to perfection."
Truth Be Told,1,"Truth Be Told is definitely taking significant steps in the right direction, but it's still not quite living up to the full potential of its premise and impressive ensemble cast."
Truth Be Told,1,"Hudson cannot quite summon the feral, streetwise quality her role requires. But she and Spencer share a chemistry suggestive of long friendship."
Mr. Corman,0,"Its efforts in trying too hard drowns out any kind of story to connect to, and it's something that no song and dance number or cool montage moment can save."
Mr. Corman,1,"Suddenly, I was sitting in Corman's chair, understanding that exact feeling and wondering what he might do next. It's a feeling I got consistently throughout the first season."
Mr. Corman,0,"Aside from a glimmer of invention when his world briefly becomes animated, there is nothing to hold your attention."
Mr. Corman,1,It's one of the best depictions of listless thirtysomething manhood I've seen in ages.
Mr. Corman,1,"Stop moping, get up off your ass, and don't waste your life complaining about it, the series seems to be saying. It takes a while for [It] to finally get there, but once the point avails itself, it retroactively redeems the entire show, and then some."
Mr. Corman,1,"He writes, directs, produces, stars, sometimes even performs music in some episodes, so it's curious that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's central character feels pretty blank in this fitfully arresting series."
Mr. Corman,1,Mr. Corman is a complex character for American TV/streaming with a richly inquisitive mind.
Mr. Corman,1,"While its overall tone of introspective, mumblecore dramedy certainly won't be for everyone, Mr. Corman offers flashes of inspiration and relatable recognition."
Mr. Corman,1,"Arturo Castro has been underrated hilarious in every show he does, but he does yeoman's work here as Victor."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman has the potential to become something truly great and powerful, a modern-day mirror to the glorifying of perceived trauma that has come to define so many narratives. You just have to give it space to get there."
Mr. Corman,1,Gordon-Levitt's engaging presence and sharply observed scripts make Mr Corman the sort of teacher you really want to spend your extracurricular hours with.
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman is a very basic premise but unlike anything else on TV. There is loads of potential here. Hopefully, it takes the distinctive building blocks from this first episode and expands on them."
Mr. Corman,1,"As director, Gordon-Levitt switches fluently from the macro to the micro, from Instagram to astronomy, a global pandemic to one person's unshakeable unease."
Mr. Corman,1,"In truth it's a little bemusing, too: there have been some great TV shows (including Curb) in which nothing much happens and Mr Corman may go on to be one of them. Or, like Mr Corman himself, it could shine at first and then disappoint."
Mr. Corman,1,"Based on the opening episodes, Mr Corman barely stands out from the other not-so-funny comedies with an indie film sensibility. But stick with it, and it unfurls into something far more curious and absorbing."
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman has a few missteps, most notably in an episode that tries to take on the bureaucracy of insurance companies, but the series more than recovers in the last few episodes."
Mr. Corman,1,Mr. Corman is a smartly experimental dramedy about the absurdity of life. Joseph Gordon Levitt should be applauded for trying to break TV boundaries and create a new narrative around mental health.
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr Corman straddles the line between drollness and ruminative drama, and is playfully experimental."
Mr. Corman,0,It's disingenuous for [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] to try to get in the mind of the average man who doesn't know what he wants to do.
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Mr. Corman,1,Consider Mr. Corman one of those instances where Gordon-Levitt and company do enough extra-credit work to legitimately class up an otherwise basic course.
Mr. Corman,1,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt's perfect rendering of the torments of a full-scale panic attack merits all accolades that come to mind. Including, of course, ""breathtaking."""
Mr. Corman,1,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his creative cohorts have created a weird, wild, and wonderful series that ranks among the most ambitious series of the year, if not the decade and/or this century."
Mr. Corman,0,"It's not dark enough or funny enough, or meaningful enough or irreverent enough."
Mr. Corman,1,"Blessed by A24 to resurrect his dormant directing career, Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes all in."
Mr. Corman,1,"Thankfully, Mr. Corman isn't a lost cause. His dreams of music stardom may have stalled along with his romantic life... but he achieves harmony as a terrific and empathetic teacher to his fifth graders,."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman doesn't fall into the expected tropes about Josh resurrecting a failed musical career, but it does speak to the idea of rediscovering things that bring you joy."
Mr. Corman,1,"Mr. Corman is ambitious, well-acted, and committed to showing respect for and curiosity about all of its characters. When you think it's going to zig all the way through ten episodes, it zags on you."
Mr. Corman,1,"From the fantasy sequences to Josh's one-man-band musical endeavors to the New Zealand-for-LA doubling, it's all over the place. But it's all over the place in an increasingly charming and creative way."
Mr. Corman,0,"Stop me if you already saw this indulgent indie flick back in the early 90s, because trust me -- you did."
Mr. Corman,1,"Gordon-Levitt throws everything into the early episodes. The first has too many didactic exchanges, but the ideas start to impress, even if they don't always illuminate each other."
Mr. Corman,1,"Even in its most jumbled or chaotic moments, Mr. Corman remains a fascinating glimpse into the mind of both its main character and its star."
Mr. Corman,1,"[Joseph Gordon-Levitt's] proving himself a thoughtful, unique filmmaker grappling in sweet, funny and subtle ways with nothing less than the existential dread at the core of our times."
Mr. Corman,0,"Because Josh is such a drag, and so generally one-note about it, even the show's more impressive Walter Mitty-ish flights of fancy ring hollow. They look cool, but in service to a thin, frustrating protagonist."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman, the new AppleTV+ series from Joseph Gordon-Levitt suffers from a number of issues, not least of which is an uninteresting lead character."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
Mr. Corman,1,"It's about a guy and his values and his masculinity and his identity and his stress over what to do with, you know, his life. It's a study of a person... And by the way, it is excellent."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"While it's packed with enough twists and turns to regularly nudge you to the edge of your seat, The Mosquito Coast frequently strains the boundaries of believability too far in an effort to sustain its secrets and mysteries."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Allie is enjoyable to watch, even as he puts his family through an endless series of challenging scenarios."
The Mosquito Coast,1,-The pilot episode is extremely focused with its set up of a family on the run. It has that edge of your seat stressful ride that carries on with each episode. There are cliffhangers and tension with every episode.
The Mosquito Coast,1,"I'm hooked on this suspenseful, seven-episode adventure/drama.thriller series on Apple TV+."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"While The Mosquito Coast may be a tough watch to get through at times, it's Justin Theroux's performance that keeps you coming back for more."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"The sheer propulsive pace of the drama has it surging forward, always. It is the proverbial white-knuckle ride, a gush of narrow escapes followed by yet more dangerous situations."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"The Mosquito Coast is not without problems... Yet taken as a whole, the show does something undoubtedly bold, infusing a fast-moving action-adventure story with the type of layered, capitalist-critical commentary that's rarely explored to this degree."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"What you can expect is a largely thrilling, sometimes frustrating journey."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"When it comes to an adrenaline rush, the TV series is the hands-down winner."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"""The Mosquito Coast"" draws blood. But it may not be the blood you expect."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Cross, who created the series and wrote or co-wrote the first three episodes, is a skilled melodramatist who knows how to keep you hooked into a story, even when it starts to leave reality completely behind."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"""The Mosquito Coast"" finds the kind of depths needed to build a history worthy of its origins and more modern inspirations. Season 1 isn't quite there yet, but Theroux is reason enough to look to the horizon."
The Mosquito Coast,1,It can seem as if the writers are unnecessarily running out the clock... But there's enough going at the level of performance and characterization that you rarely feel as if a given scene is devoid of purpose.
The Mosquito Coast,1,Fans of the novel or the 1986 movie may be underwhelmed but everyone else may find this jaunt south of the border to be worth the investment.
The Mosquito Coast,1,"The scripting is very tightly paced, allowing sufficient time to understand the motivations of the wife and children while keeping the father as a bundled-up coil of nerves that threaten to explode at any moment."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Apple TV's version is fine as a distraction or entertainment to be watched here and there in parts. Yet it tries too hard to keep us watching by not saying much, or saving important information until the very end."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Maybe such candor is too much to ask of a show created for a platform owned by one of the world's most valuable corporations. Sadly, the alternative leaves us with a commercial for thinking about America more than a complete thought."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"When an insufferable man is putting his family in danger and spouting philosophy, it's hard to care about his adventures on the run."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
The Mosquito Coast,1,Has a real chance to be the next talked-about series.
The Mosquito Coast,1,"A prestige feeling thriller with an all-star cast and a solid production pedigree, this is the sort of series that feels, on paper, like it should be a slam dunk. And it's not... bad."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"A stellar Justin Theroux, playing Allie Fox with an addictive mix of naive warmth and smug self-righteousness, is backed up by a strong cast capable of making you care about the Fox family and invest in their plight."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The bottom line is Apple has produced a series that not only fails to get under your skin, but mostly just makes you want to swat it away."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Beautifully written, directed and photographed, Mosquito Coast is addictive."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"It's pretty well put together, at least to begin."
The Mosquito Coast,1,Secrets are scattered across this bracing cinematic plunge into the odyssey of the Foxes. It's the next great TV show you should see.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The most prescient thing this version of The Mosquito Coast has to say about capitalism is how quickly it morphs into a knockoff of Breaking Bad and Ozark, repackaging a primetime TV template to bring an old story to a new audience."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"If you have to be stuck on a meandering, seemingly endless trek with a family of four, you could do a lot worse than the quartet of actors cast as the Foxes."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Ultimately, the first season feels a bit like a walkway to the real story -- or, more accurately, a runway. It's a lot of busy preamble."
The Mosquito Coast,1,The Mosquito Coast makes up for a lack of buzz with breathtaking scale and a brash Justin Theroux.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"A lot of bleeding-heart sentiments are expressed in a show where a white family traverse the hostile, corpse-ridden landscape from the US to Mexico like tourists in other people's suffering."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
The Mosquito Coast,1,"The first season feels like a prologue to the novel's richer, deeper environmental concerns about American colonialism. Still, Theroux is convincing and compelling as this delusional narcissist of an antihero."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Time after time, the Foxes seem utterly snookered only to be saved by a completely outrageous twist. Still, it's all handsomely shot, the action is tense and kinetic, and before long we're getting some confronting perspectives on the American Southwest."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"There's enough twists, turns and tantalising teases to make an initial exploratory dip into the first instalment turn into an addictive all-night binge."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
The Mosquito Coast,0,Even [Justin Theroux's] absorbing performance can't make Mosquito Coast make sense.
The Mosquito Coast,1,"Educational and entertaining in equal measure, The Mosquito Coast rattles its sabre at contemporary issues, whilst delivering a supremely polished piece of mainstream entertainment."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The title, and the blueprints from other shows, seem disposable, or at least casually, even wastefully transposable. How predictably American, Allie Fox would probably think."
The Mosquito Coast,1,"""The Mosquito Coast"" is stronger in its unpredictable plotting than its dialogue, and its momentum is remarkable. It really never sags for its seven episodes, taking Allie and his family to unexpected places on their journey."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is a poignant, slow-building drama that raises the bar for centering Black characters and weaving truth and fiction into great television."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"With powerful actors Samuel L. Jackson and Dominique Fishback at the center, this book-turned-limited series is affecting and habit-forming, with fully-fleshed characters occupying a brisk plot."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"It’s worth diving in, not just for Jackson’s career-best performance, but for Fishback’s too."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"First-rate Jackson, entertaining series."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"[Jackson gives] a superb, profoundly moving performance, the best we’ve ever seen from him."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Fishback, the breakout star of HBO’s The Deuce, is as incandescent as the young Samuel L. Jackson was, and they make a superb team. It’s the best intergenerational TV show in recent memory."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Jackson brings every conceivable shading to the role, with confused grief evolving into a charming swagger as the real Ptolemy emerges..."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"What audiences get is a family melodrama where mental illness is addressed on the way to another destination. There’s no doubting the sincerity of those involved, but ultimately this glossy slice of streaming content lacks teeth in its latter stages..."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Similar to a novella, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey takes its time getting set up, making sure we understand the Before, so the After lands a solid punch. If youre patient, this one pays off."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"The narrative focus becomes one of its more ambitious elements, matching Samuel L. Jacksons dramatic range in bringing this story to life."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Like many streaming series, thus one can feel a little overlong, a little too involved with loose storylines that don’t add to the essence. But, throughout, Samuel L. Jackson dazzles in a down-to-earth way."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,“The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” has the rare quality of finding strengths in being hard to classify.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,The prolific Jackson provides a reminder of his range.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of the best performances in his career in the new six-part The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,This is a more vulnerable and subtle role for Jackson. Jackson breathes an endearing life into Ptolemy that easily charms viewers and immediately has us wanting to protect him.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Just securing a project featuring Jackson (who produces as well as stars) is probably coup enough for the streaming service, but the marquee value doesn't overcome what turns out to be a slog as a viewing proposition."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"While “Ptolemy” has flaws in its execution, it’s redeemed by earth-shaking performances, and justifies Jackson’s desire to spotlight a storyteller confined to the page for too long."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Due to its meandering nature and stretched out plot, the novel would have been better served as a well-structured film than a rambling TV series. Despite first rate performances from its stars, this is a show you’re likely to soon forget."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Jackson and Fishback fill the screen with pain that goes bone-deep, and joy that feels like a glorious victory."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,A satisfying piece of entertainment and subtle social commentary.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Most of its pleasure comes from the easy rapport between Jackson and Fishback.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"There is much to recommend it; for all its dark elements, it is, more than anything, sweet."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Completely absorbing to sink into and reflect upon.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"If the story sometimes meanders, Samuel L. Jackson and Dominique Fishback's performances and Walter Mosley's dialogue consistently hold up."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey is a contemplative and winding drama that offers both Samuel L Jackson and Dominique Fishback a compelling showcase for their many talents.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"What feels so fresh—and so successful, thanks to stunning performances from Jackson and Fishback—is the boldness with which Mosley combines seemingly incompatible elements."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Ptolemy Grey braids a few genres with style and humor to showcase its star’s range.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,“The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey” runneth over with life. It’s easy to forgive it for being a bit much.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Jackson has never been in finer form. But Fishback stands toe to toe with the giant...
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,A series that started out a heartbreaker ends in a shrug.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"[Samuel L. Jackson and Dominique Fishback's] pas de deux is a wonder all its own, something rare and exhilarating, an alchemical reaction of youth and experience, defiance and resignation, fragility and stone."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"It is in many ways a career-best performance from Jackson (and from Fishback, though we must hope that hers is merely the first of many to come)..."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"It all holds together well, even though this could have been more effectively told in four instead of six episodes."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"At the very least, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey serves as one of Samuel L. Jacksons finest performances and another example of why Dominique Fishback needs more leading roles."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,It’s a subtle archetypal shift that proves once again that Jackson is one of the greatest actors of our time.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,This adaptation of Walter Mosley’s novel provides a moving account of the bewildering existence endured by Jackson’s Ptolemy.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,The series starts strong but its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"See it for Jackson and Fishback, in particular, and for what they can accomplish when plot takes a back seat to character."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,"Handsomely mounted and thoughtfully paced, this is Samuel L. Jackson giving it his all with a complex, emotional, deeply personal role. In a decades-long career, he’s rarely been better."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,1,Performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Dominique Fishback are the saving grace for a series that wears its heart on its sleeve and is emotionally manipulative enough that one can’t help but be sympathetic to it.
Schmigadoon!,1,"A terrific cast delivers an uneven, but fun, comic parody of musicals."
Schmigadoon!,1,Features a cast of TV and Broadway stars more than willing to have fun. [Full review in Spanish]
Schmigadoon!,1,"...Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio's series for Apple tv does have plenty to recommend, not least the pitch-perfect songs..."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Sometimes it seems like they're devoting so much energy to recreating the classic movie musical, they allow the actual narrative to fall by the wayside. Still, it's difficult to judge Schmigadoon! too harshly: its heart is undeniably in the right place."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! coasts on smug finger-wagging. Still, it does so while wringing thrills out of the talents of modern musical icons like Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cumming, and Jane Krakowski."
Schmigadoon!,1,A love letter to musicals with first-class ingredients that doesn't quite deliver.
Schmigadoon!,1,"You're not required to be a golden-age Broadway geek to enjoy. But it can be awfully fun to shout, ""Oh wow, that's a direct quote from 'Carousel'"" to politely indifferent viewers in the room."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Bright, colorful, and lots of surreal fun, this series spoofing creaky old musicals both satirizes the conventions of the genre and gives us a central story to hold onto."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Once it finds its stride, Schmigadoon! is an irresistibly fun and ultimately heartwarming musical rom-com."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Nice cast and all, but Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio's strained and stilted offering spends most of its time threading a rickety line between half-baked parody and annoyingly clunky Rodgers and Hammerstein tribute."
Schmigadoon!,1,Schmigadoon! is a hell of a lot of fun and an absolute love letter to the musicals of years gone by.
Schmigadoon!,1,What makes a musical work for the musical-averse? A healthy dose of skepticism toward the very genre it's operating within.
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! gleefully spoofs golden age musicals, while delivering a pitch-perfect spin on the genre."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! also takes a simplistic approach to addressing people's problems... But, after a barren year for Broadway and the West End, this good-hearted show is a welcome musical reprise."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Overall, this is a top-notch production that captures the style and verve of the old productions and has fun with it without being snide."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! is funny, quirky, and had me saying, ""I'm just so happy for Cecily Strong,"" out loud multiple times."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It becomes a teensy-weensy bit tiring (at one point, a leprechaun appears in a puff of green smoke), but it's all done with a giggle and a gigantic wink."
Schmigadoon!,1,"In a time of harsh realities and hard truths, Schmigadoon! challenges us to laugh at the absurdities of life and trust in love. Not only that, but it literally tells us to ""Enjoy the ride."""
Schmigadoon!,1,"Saturday Night Live veteran Strong and the seemingly ubiquitous Key are solid, if not spectacular in the leads, leaving a deliciously dark Chenoweth (The West Wing) to steal the show."
Schmigadoon!,0,"What seems like a strength at first, of having every song and dance as a full production number, quickly becomes wearing after the initial impressiveness wears off."
Schmigadoon!,1,"For people open to a low-stakes theater sendup that definitely feels like an overblown SNL sketch, Schmigadoon's worth giving a go."
Schmigadoon!,1,"What works in the show's favor though, is that all the actors and actresses in leading and supporting roles, including Keegan-Michael Key, are well cast and watchable, and reason enough to tune in."
Schmigadoon!,1,"This has energy, and smarts, and while some gags don't land, others very much do."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A hilarious parody - a satirical, six-episode summer trifle - on Apple TV+."
Schmigadoon!,1,"With high production values, sharp writing, and a nearly perfect cast, Schmigadoon! is off to a great start."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Bright, zany and crackling with energy, Schmigadoon has all the trappings of an exciting and fun musical series. And it is - most of the time."
Schmigadoon!,1,"The show is full of glorious musical numbers with impeccable costumes, sets and choreography, performed by some of the best stage and screen musical stars working right now."
Schmigadoon!,1,This is the kind of TV series that is custom made for people who are fans of musical theater.
Schmigadoon!,1,"It's so strange and niche, it may actually work..."
Schmigadoon!,1,Eminently likable Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key star...
Schmigadoon!,1,"A really endearing, frothy ode to 1940s musicals in the style of Rogers and Hammerstein and Cole Porter."
Schmigadoon!,1,Big and bouncy fun!
Schmigadoon!,1,"It is not necessarily the most groundbreaking or experimental comedy, but it's thoroughly enjoyable and sweet, the kind of uncomplicated series that makes an easy summer watch."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It would work to the show's advantage to lean on its Broadway cast more and not be afraid to find the humor in darker topics. Either way, I'm off to sing ""Corn Pudding"" one more time!"
Schmigadoon!,0,"Like so many quality control-lacking project with Lorne Michaels as an executive producer, this series... is an SNL skit in search of a story."
Schmigadoon!,1,The songs are pretty clever... for a show that will keep you smiling.
Schmigadoon!,1,"The Joshes of the world are unlikely ever to warm to ""Schmigadoon!"" To my fellow Melissas: Dust off your character shoes. Our time is now."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Much like its Apple TV+ counterpart ""Ted Lasso,"" this is a series that's optimistic and uplifting."
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Simply put, it's sporadically fun but a little too cute for its own good."
Schmigadoon!,1,"If you're somebody who loves musicals, you're going to find a lot to love in Schmigadoon! If you're not, you may well find yourself totally lost."
Schmigadoon!,1,An irresistible song-and dance romcom that gleefully mocks the thing it loves. Strong and Key lead a cast of Broadway greats in a series that throws so many woke and witty curveballs that even musical haters will be laughing too hard to resist.
Schmigadoon!,1,An enchanting and hilarious parody series
Schmigadoon!,1,Schmigadoon! would make Rodgers and Hammerstein proud.
Schmigadoon!,1,"The show goofs on the conventions of the genre, but it's an affectionate goof, one that makes fun of the sexism and vapidity of the old shows while simultaneously delivering top-notch and well-shot choreography and plenty of catchy schmaltz."
Schmigadoon!,1,"This is no sketch; it's a gloriously colourful, uplifting and sustained spoof with a ton of heart and a small army of great stage-musical performers."
Schmigadoon!,1,Schmigadoon! is a hoot -- an inventive and thoroughly enjoyable summer delight.
Schmigadoon!,1,"A savvy send-up of classic Broadway, Schmigadoon! is probably the best time one can have with one's TV at the moment."
Schmigadoon!,1,"t's a pointed skewering of traditional notions of morality and the Hollywood Golden Age musicals that celebrated them, but it's all deftly done and light-hearted in nature."
Schmigadoon!,1,"""Schmigadoon!"" manages to both expose and celebrate the formulaic structure of traditional musicals; theater buffs will love the sheer audacity of it all."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A hoot and a hymn to a bygone tradition, Schmigadoon! is such a delight I never wanted to leave."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It is so sweet, so innocently knowing, so pleased with itself. Frankly, the whole thing is mortifying. I love it. I love it with the helplessness of a musical protagonist being yanked into an indulgent, unnecessary dream ballet."
Schmigadoon!,1,"If you're a person who, say, wrote a substantial paper about movie musicals in college (ahem), it's a lot of fun picking over choreography flourishes and musical and lyrical flourishes as they are, in some cases, mashed up with modern life."
Schmigadoon!,1,The cast of Schmigadoon! is a parade of insane talent.
Schmigadoon!,1,"Plays like an absurdly ambitious ""Saturday Night Live"" recurring sketch, or a much less ambitious musical spoof created expressly for the small screen."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Even if you don't recognise all the visual and musical references, you'll know some of the songs being lovingly lampooned -- and even if you don't, it's impossible not to get caught up in the silly, infectious fun."
Schmigadoon!,1,The love story that emerges most charmingly is that of a parody falling hard for the subject it intended to satirize.
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon! is cute, as far as it goes; it just doesn't go as far, or as hard, as fans of contemporary TV musicals might expect."
Schmigadoon!,1,"In an era when snark and cynicism are easy and dismayingly popular, ""Schmigadoon!"" opts for a different path. It asks why everyone is singing, then answers by singing along."
Schmigadoon!,0,It's one of those comedies that works well enough at the moment and only loses the melody when one considers how great it could and should have been.
Schmigadoon!,1,"If a lot of it is an inferior knockoff of the real thing, it's a mostly pleasant and often appealing one."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A six-episode summer trifle... it can sometimes be a bit of a toothache, but the series is also just as often irresistible, with a tremendously committed, blue-chip cast working at the peak of their powers."
Schmigadoon!,1,"A hilarious, must-see, spoof of classic musicals"
Schmigadoon!,1,"There's a reverence for the musicals from the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, but it's through a sharpened critical and contemporary lens."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Schmigadoon will be catnip for musical fans, but the appeal may not transfer over to those who aren't into classic musicals."
Schmigadoon!,1,"What I enjoyed most about Schmigadoon! is it is not only a musical and a rom-com, it's also an anatomy of a love in its second phase. It breaks it down and takes us on this journey of whether or not love can survive."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It's hard not to grab on to the confectionary delight of this show with both hands, rolling and reveling in the sincere joy it takes in the idea of the musical as both an art form and necessary emotional touchstone."
Schmigadoon!,1,"The series manages to be simultaneously an adoring homage to the genre and a spot-on satire of it; every trope is lovingly upended, every plot difficulty laid bare."
Schmigadoon!,1,"At just six episodes, it neatly wraps up its story in a way that seems to shut down any questions about a second season, but it's hard not to wish for an encore performance."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Despite the magic of show-stopping musical numbers, Schmigadoon! provides a surprisingly realistic depiction of a relationship rut."
Schmigadoon!,1,Certainly a love it or hate it show but for those that enjoy humor & musicals this one is a blast! Cecily Strong & Keegan-Michael Key make some beautiful music together.
Schmigadoon!,1,"There's a lot to like about Schmigadoon! Musical theater nerds get to see perennial favorites like Chenoweth and Tveit camp it up in delightfully stagey numbers, and the show seems a pleasant showcase for Strong's musical and dramatic chops."
Schmigadoon!,1,"It's a very affectionate, very specific parody of Golden Age musicals, and theater nerds will undoubtedly adore it... but others might be put off by all the excessive cheer. (The exclamation point in the title is there for a reason.)"
Schmigadoon!,0,"After having borrowed quite so heavily from traditional forms, the show only haltingly and gradually, and without much of the help that the neglected Key and Strong might have provided, arrives at something that can stand on its own."
Schmigadoon!,1,"Cecily Strong is a hero for our time, even if she has to spend some time in Schmigadoon to prove it."
Dr. Brain,1,"Despite the somewhat absurd premise, this adaptation plays it mostly straight, keeping its story grounded in character drama and sci-fi."
Dr. Brain,0,"It does go some way to fulfilling it prophecy in terms of jump scares, eerie underground car parks and ominous shadows, but is let down by a plot which requires Cliffs Notes."
Dr. Brain,1,"While the shows sci-fi leanings turned out to be a touch superficial, the project is carried off with such visual aplomb by director Kim... that its aesthetic delights largely make up for any narrative shortfalls."
Dr. Brain,1,"An adaptation of Hongjacga's eponymous webtoon that condenses in its six accurate chapters one of the freest, most mind-blowing and addictive TV shows of the year."
Dr. Brain,1,"Some folks may not find Dr. Brain to be as weird as they'd like it to be, but the overall series is still entertaining."
Dr. Brain,1,"As the show leans more into its silliest possibilities, the more entertaining it becomes, inviting comparisons to everything from Flatliners to The Fly in how it blends genre thrills with a cautionary high concept tale."
Dr. Brain,1,Dr. Brain is an intriguing blend of imaginative science fiction and mystery.
Dr. Brain,1,"A mad, thrilling mix of Inception and Frankenstein."
Dr. Brain,1,"Dr. Brain is a well-written exploration of science that perhaps goes too far, especially in the hands of someone so curious. We just hope it keeps that interesting premise and doesn't become another run-of-the-mill thriller."
Dr. Brain,1,"Although the show fumbles through the details of the brain sync mechanism, the central story of Dr. Koh's search for truth and redemption is resoundingly coherent."
Dr. Brain,1,"Whole sections of ""Dr. Brain"" are silly as hell, but to paraphrase the old song: You might've been a headache. But you never were a bore."
Dr. Brain,1,There's certainly been nothing else quite like it on TV lately.
Dr. Brain,0,Dr. Brain jettisons the most intriguing parts of its own setup in favor of a missing persons mystery that ultimately lands where so many other rogue scientist stories lead.
Dr. Brain,1,"With strong concept and even stronger performances, [Dr. Brain] is perfect for fans of crime thrillers, horror, and sci-fi alike."
Dr. Brain,0,"Too often Dr. Brain dodges the dark freakiness of its central idea and instead lingers on rote, slow-moving mystery plotting."
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
Dr. Brain,1,"These questions could make the series stagnant, but Kim's signature propulsive visual storytelling and other choice spices bring big-screen sensibilities to small-screen material."
Dr. Brain,1,A superior and enveloping thriller that constantly jabs at the viewer's kidneys.
Dr. Brain,1,"For most of its run, ""Dr. Brain"" is a classy and absorbing entertainment."
The Big Conn,1,"The jaw-dropping escapades described in this true crime story, along with the gripping accounts of the people caught in the crossfire, make for a uniquely entertaining docuseries."
The Big Conn,1,It’s as intriguing as a good scripted drama...
The Big Conn,1,"Even though it’s too long, The Big Conn is a worthwhile look at a case that made little news outside of Kentucky."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
The Big Conn,1,The Big Conn does a wonderful job of not getting swept up in Conn’s eccentricity...This one highlights moments of absurdity while also making sure that the victims stay at the center...
The Big Conn,1,"Conn’s wild antics, from his outlandish personal life to his ill-fated, “Catch Me If You Can” taunting of the FBI, are the stuff of feature films..."
The Big Conn,0,A Convoluted Story Tries To Make Light Of A Real Tragedy.
The Big Conn,1,Hernandez and Lazarte recount the entire tale with considerably more zeal and alacrity than what the government displayed toward a rather obvious picking of its pocket.
The Big Conn,0,"There is no reason this needed to be four one-hour episodes. You can easily edit this down to one two-part and release it that way and the same story gets told. As you are watching it, the viewer is sitting there like, “okay, I get it.”"
Losing Alice,1,Draws on both the universe of Alfred Hitchcock... and the dreamlike frameworks of David Lynch. [Full review in Spanish]
Losing Alice,1,"Losing Alice takes pride in its direction and attempts to reel in the audience with half-measured answers and eeriness. It's not the story it wants to be yet, but it has promise."
Losing Alice,1,"It's a thoroughly engaging yet enigmatic Hitchcockian thriller that likes to toy with the audience, revealing its storyline teasingly through flashbacks, flash-forwards and films-within-the-show."
Losing Alice,1,"Losing Alice, besides being a seductively-paced drama you may have trouble shutting off, is also a backdoor commentary on women who disappear from the entertainment business around middle age, both in front of the camera and behind it."
Losing Alice,0,"Apple's new miniseries looks gorgeous, but its cinematic sensibilities don't quite make for gripping telly..."
Losing Alice,1,It will definitely resonate with working moms out there...a little bit of Fatal Attraction to it...
Losing Alice,1,"Losing Alice seeks to seduce you with pretty smart, very sexy and maybe just a little bit frightening."
Losing Alice,1,"Tense, complex erotic thriller has sex, alcohol, drugs."
Losing Alice,1,"Avin patiently investigates the nature of relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, women of different generations, older men and younger women-and, in a stunning finale, between life and art."
Losing Alice,1,"A neo-noir erotic thriller that shouldn't be watched with certain family members, in Losing Alice Apple TV+ has acquired yet another feast for the senses."
Losing Alice,1,"An absorbing tale of obsession and jealousy that's filled with twists, turns and shifts in time."
Losing Alice,0,"It might have worked effectively as a 3-hour movie, but at 7 hours doled out over eight episodes, Losing Alice dribs and drabs, but mostly drabs."
Losing Alice,1,"Anchored by a couple of tremendous performances, ""Losing Alice"" can take an evocative color palette, a well-placed camera, and a few gentle moves to unlock some genuine uncertainty and anxiety."
Losing Alice,1,Is it a psychological thriller? A dark story of obsession? A cautionary tale about the way we view creativity and female ambition? The answer is that the show is all of those things -- and more.
Losing Alice,0,"Despite the interesting way Alice and Sophie play off each other in the first two episodes, their interactions and the show as a whole has increasingly diminishing returns."
Losing Alice,1,Ayelet Zurer absolutely hits the right notes as Alice.
Losing Alice,0,"As a psychological drama, Losing Alice feels too self-conscious to be enjoyable or even provocative. Its inherent eroticism feels ill-earned only because Avin seems to be prone to sanitising the brazen fixations of his protagonists."
Losing Alice,1,"It shocks and surprises, and but with glossy authenticity."
Losing Alice,1,"An immensely compelling drama, if an overlong one, and a heroine who is, title notwithstanding, anything but lost."
Losing Alice,1,"The echoes here include Fatal Attraction and even The Player, but focusing the power dynamic on two women gives the building menace a fresh perspective."
Losing Alice,1,Apple's erotic thriller is too timid to bare it all. But lush visuals and a couple of excellent performances are its saving grace.
Losing Alice,0,Director and writer Sigal Avin so belabors the point that an idle mind can stray into self-destruction that Losing Alice paradoxically has the same effect on its viewers.
Lisey's Story,0,"Theres no internal logic to Liseys Story, and theres little formal filmmaking logic, either."
Lisey's Story,1,Liseys Story is the end result of a lot of mismatched top-tier talents...a textbook case of its parts being greater than its whole.
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Lisey's Story,1,Stephen King and Pablo Larraín collaborate on an unusual but potent expressionist horror-romance.
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is beautifully shot, features stellar performances and production values, and oozes with haunting atmosphere. That said, its story rarely achieves the high bar set by these other elements."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story shows that even the best artists - Moore, Joan Allen and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisey's sisters, director Larraín and cinematographer Khondji - can give it their all and be hamstrung by the material."
Lisey's Story,1,Lisey's Story is a great case study for the strengths and weaknesses of King's writing - beautiful themes occasionally clashing against self-indulgence
Lisey's Story,1,"Julianne Moore, Joan Allen, Clive Owen and Dane DeHaan are standouts in a mystical story created by Stephen King."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite Moore's earnest performance, the show gets stuck in a twilight zone between hokey and horrifying. It ultimately comes to resemble a ponderous, misshapen beast, much like the one that haunts Boo'ya Moon."
Lisey's Story,0,Another King adaptation that can be added to that long list of disappointments with this wasted snooze fest.
Lisey's Story,1,"Will it fill a day's worth of binge-watching? Absolutely. Is it made by some of the most impressive talents working in film and television today? Undoubtedly. Will it go down as one of the series highlights of the year? Sadly, that is very, very unlikely."
Lisey's Story,0,"This is intense, dark and disturbing material that could have woven the thread more adeptly through the needle. Sometimes we worry about Stephen King."
Lisey's Story,1,I really like this. I find it surprising for Apple TV+ to be doing a show like this too.
Lisey's Story,1,"Larraîn manages to maintain the same pulsing direction he demonstrated in Ema or Jackie, but only in the first episode. The series loses steam, though. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Lisey's Story,1,Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are both very suitable. [Full Review in Spanish]
Lisey's Story,1,"It's perfectly crafted, austere and elliptically put together, but it does little to stir the blood."
Lisey's Story,1,"King put so much of his heart into both the novel and onto the screen that you can't help but be moved by it, despite the pacing issues. Of course he didn't want to take too much away in his adaptation: how do you edit a love letter?"
Lisey's Story,1,"It is hard to look away from the sublime nature of the couple's love story, one that transcends the darkness of mental illness and childhood trauma."
Lisey's Story,1,"With a dreamy, surreal tone, director Pablo Larraín navigates an introduction to a story about who owns intangible things like memory, passion, and creativity."
Lisey's Story,1,"The execution may be lacking, but the idea of Big Little Lies by way of The Shining is sound."
Lisey's Story,1,"As I've mentioned, these issues start to smooth out in the third and fourth episodes - but the bumpy start may be off-putting to some viewers."
Lisey's Story,0,An eight-episode gluepot.
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story's failings aren't an indictment of King the screenwriter, they're a tribute to King the novelist."
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is ultimately a cautionary example of what can go wrong with the creative process when a megabucks patron such as Apple says ""yes"" to everyone."
Lisey's Story,1,It's as riveting to watch Julianne Moore wander through her own memory as it is witnessing her interactions with those around her.
Lisey's Story,1,"Julianne Moore is engrossing as the titular Lisey, a woman adrift since Scott died two years ago."
Lisey's Story,1,"For all its faults, the miniseries has a shockingly good cast, making clunky dialogue sound almost natural, and rising to and often above the material in ways which, at best, feel legitimately transformative."
Lisey's Story,1,Magical surrealism. Embracing those two words will be key to your enjoyment of Stephen King's latest series Lisey's Story.
Lisey's Story,1,"An honest work about a literary life and love, and the dangers of the obsessions great talents can inspire... It's an imperfect piece that can be confusing and hypnotic, uneven but hard to look away from."
Lisey's Story,0,"The problem is that when it's this close to the heart, it can often be a case of not being able to see the wood from the trees."
Lisey's Story,0,"""Stephen King's Greatest Hits""...slow, obscure, structured to maximize the tedium and obscurity, and thus a little wearing."
Lisey's Story,1,"Director Pablo Larrain, cinematographer Darius Khondji and the production design team infuse Lisey's Story"" with an unforgettable look..."
Lisey's Story,1,"The show is paced slowly but deliberately, with just enough revealed in each episode to keep you guessing until the end."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
Lisey's Story,0,"Add a relentlessly repetitive narrative structure, and the show is left with precious little space to let dread build, to make the scary things scary and the emotional things moving."
Lisey's Story,0,There's a whimsy that Stephen King usually has that is absent in total.
Lisey's Story,0,"[Director Pablo Larraín] never entirely immerses us in horror or submerge us in grief. It's the opposite, actually. Instead of engrossed, I felt trapped."
Lisey's Story,1,"Lisey's Story is definitely more ambitious and stylized than your average King adaptation. It boasts a great turn from a powerful if underused Moore. But from the first two episodes, it's yet to find its footing"
Lisey's Story,1,"When those wails seem to catch her by surprise, Moore captures that idea of out-of-nowhere despair better than almost anyone."
Lisey's Story,0,"Even though there is an actual Lisey's Story in Lisey's Story, it's a story for Lisey from Scott; not one of her or by her."
Lisey's Story,1,"At the end of the day with this show, as with Stephen King's literature, I just wished I was more a fan of the genre to be able to appreciate it."
Lisey's Story,1,"The point where the storyline shifts to a netherworld will put off some viewers, but there is so much to luxuriate in, from the exquisite setting and colour palette, to the performances of Moore, Allen and Leigh."
Lisey's Story,1,Lisey's Story is a dark and complicated story as there's a thick web pulling Lisey and the audience in a multitude of directions. Director Pablo Larrain has made this visually appealing to look at and his cast with have you emotionally pulled in tight.
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is the definition of a slow burn series.
Lisey's Story,1,"A deeply confusing series that does eventually reward steadfast patience, but also does a lot to push a skeptical viewer away... It's a fantasy about life after Stephen King, though his passions and pretensions are unmissable throughout."
Lisey's Story,1,It's surprising how much of Lisey's Story as a miniseries works.
Lisey's Story,0,What's on screen can be bloated and exasperating. But Stephen King's eight-hour version of his favorite among his own scary novels can-thanks to stars Julianne Moore and Clive Owen-pull you up short with the beauty and terror of marriage.
Lisey's Story,0,Larraín is a filmmaker who thinks in images and abstractions. King loves to create extravagantly detailed fantasy universes and the tension between these two approaches isn't always productive.
Lisey's Story,1,"The photography is lavish and painterly, though it would be hard to make the Maine woods look anything less than glorious."
Lisey's Story,1,All the performances are first-rate. Mr. Owen is in rare form -- the role of the wounded child-turned-artist is not something previously in the actor's repertoire. Ms. Allen and Ms. Moore are extraordinary
Lisey's Story,0,"It's disappointing given the top-tier cast and production team. The three brilliant female leads are mostly weeping, catatonic or angry and confused, which is relatable to those of us struggling to keep up with the narrative."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has the distinct feel of something that has been created by a bunch of men who haven't been told 'no' in quite some time. Ultimately, it is a woman who pays for their overindulgence."
Lisey's Story,0,"While Lisey's Story was one of King's best novels in part because of its complexity, he was unable to edit down the endless subplots and subtext that float well in the novel's undercurrents but become choking and unwieldy on screen."
Lisey's Story,0,"The Apple TV+ limited series lands in the shallow end of the King cinematic pool, with a convoluted story that mostly squanders its big-name cast."
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has a strong cast and direction, but the writing ultimately sinks the series."
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
Lisey's Story,1,"Lisey's Story, from the mind of Stephen King, hinges on performances from an exceptional ensemble cast who deliver."
Lisey's Story,0,"The back half of this miniseries is so bogged down by inconsistent pacing, drawn-out scenes, muddled plotting, and a frustratingly anticlimactic ending that all the good Lisey's Story delivers before that collapse ends up overshadowed."
Lisey's Story,1,"Totemic language and objects abound in Lisey's Story...bring their winding, disorienting drama to life with misty, shadowy, shimmering beauty."
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Lisey's Story,1,"Its effectiveness, even in some of its less compelling moments, with heady and heartfelt writing, and performances that simmer is hard to forget. It's the Stephen King adaptation I've been waiting for."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is pretty to look at and fairly faithful, but far too bloated to be very engaging."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
Lisey's Story,1,"The Lisey's Story series allows viewers to see Stephen King's mind unleashed...for better or worse. The ride is enjoyable, though, filled with memorable moments"
Lisey's Story,1,Not nearly as epic as some of King's work but is worth the additional running time to explore the complex layers of the story. The result is a limited series that earns a spot alongside the best adaptations of any Stephen King novel.
Lisey's Story,1,"""Lisey's Story"" is unmistakably a writer's miniseries, so much that it romances a rough draft."
Lisey's Story,1,"A relatively faithful and gorgeous adaptation, which includes delivering a bloated narrative that could have served itself better with a more expedited journey."
Lisey's Story,1,Superbly disturbing artistry of [director] Pablo Lorrain sneaks up and disarms any natural defenses.
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
Lisey's Story,0,"Director Pablo Larraín and a splendid cast led by Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are left with the task of making Lisey's Story cinematic, resulting in a push-and-pull that's all-too-visible, especially in the series' clumsy back-half."
Lisey's Story,1,"There's much here that works well: What is meant to be scary is scary, what is meant to touch the heart will."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
Roar,1,"A thought-provoking anthology that highlights empathy, compassion."
Roar,0,"A series with certain traits of audacity that wants to make a statement about female empowerment in these revolutionizing times, but often does so with more clumsiness than intelligence. [Full review in Spanish]"
Roar,1,"Full of mystery and fantasy.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Roar,0,"In the end, the biggest problems with “Roar” may be failures not of the filmmakers, but of the medium itself. Some short stories simply work better on the page"
Roar,0,"The problem of Roar might just be the curse of inconsistency that always follows around anthologies. But this feels like something more serious than a case of variable quality, and instead something more existential for the show itself. On"
Roar,1,"Whether you crave the catharsis of an abusive boyfriend being carted off by Animal Control, or the rush of solving your own murder ... ""Roar"" has enough darkly comic delights to make you shout."
Roar,1,"Though it suffers from the typical unevenness of an anthology series, even its weaker entries are still solid, and their blessedly short half-hour runtime makes it all go down smooth."
Roar,0,"Roar has built a daring experiment, bringing in a diverse group of female writing, directing, and acting heavyweights -- which makes the series almost fascinating in its failure to deliver."
Roar,1,"Ultimately, the series is an interesting look at several uniquely feminine perspectives  and despite a few weak spots, it's worth watching for the sake of better understanding what it's like to be a woman."
Roar,1,"While its blend of humour and magical realism makes for fascinating viewing, its the poignant observations Roar makes during each episode that makes this show essential."
Roar,1,"The best episodes don't let the whimsical framing detract from reality. Instead, it makes it clear that the promise of a happy ever after is as fantastical as any fairytale."
Roar,1,"Even when the show’s inquiries of “what it feels to be a woman today” feel predictable, stretched, or tame, Roar is never not rewarding."
Roar,1,"By keeping the stories simple, Roar is able to send its messages without hammering it over viewers’ heads. Could some of the episodes stick their landings better? Sure. But the storytelling in the series mostly solid."
Roar,0,"Some of these are so on the nose, they lose their creative energy because they're so obvious."
Roar,1,"Streaming services are glutted with anthology series, but we still needed this one. Truthful, validating and sometimes just plain magical."
Roar,1,"There’s a lot of creativity and some powerful performances in Roar’s tales about the challenges women experience, but the 30-minute episodes almost all feel overly long and predictable."
Roar,0,All the starry turns and strong performances can’t make this anthology series cohere into a show that has something to say about contemporary womanhood.
Roar,1,"While Roar has its hits and misses, its anchored by strong performances and stylish production value. It’s also refreshing to see an anthology series focus on women’s issues, driven by (mostly) women writers and directors."
Roar,1,A remarkable and frequently mind-bending eight-part anthology.
Roar,1,"What unifies the chapters, other than that they are about women in a variety of circumstances, is that they are satisfyingly, pleasantly weird."
Roar,1,"When it works, it really works, and even when it doesn’t quite come together, it is different enough to demand your attention."
Roar,0,"Mostly the stories hammer you over the head with their obviousness, then peter out."
Roar,0,"A series of one-line set-ups are expanded into eight (mostly) lacklustre episodes in Apples Roar, an ill-advised attempt at wokeness that ends up doing a disservice to its many relevant ideas."
Roar,1,"The chapters take on different storytelling genres, some more successfully than others. But even the less successful endeavors feature actors who eagerly tear away at the material, which lends itself to a visceral experience."
Roar,0,"While stylish and provocative, the series ultimately falls a little flat in its message. If a woman’s plight is to suffer, then Roar doesn’t end up giving its women a way out."
Roar,1,"The end result is a mixed bag of vignettes that don’t always feel cogent, but are never boring."
Roar,1,Roar is generally one of the weirdest shows that the year 2022 has seen.
Roar,1,Roar tells uncanny tales about our modern world that lay bare the absurdity of the stigmas and obstacles that women encounter in everyday life. It is also a daring foray into the surreal.
Roar,1,A sweet treat that is (mostly) good for you.
Roar,1,"The MVPs of Roar just might be the casting directors, who found the actors who could not just handle this material, but find subtlety where there sometimes is none."
Roar,1,"Tones and takeaways may change, but the show’s consistent howl is motivating. Roar recognizes how much time it has to deliver its messages, making the most of its 30 minutes, each and every time."
Roar,0,"In its attempts to universalize these intensely personal experiences, Roar loses much of the heart that makes them worth caring about to begin with."
Roar,1,"Roar is one part Black Mirror, one part The Twilight Zone, all filtered through the lens of feminism."
Swagger,1,A refreshing look at youth basketball
Swagger,1,"Swagger doesn't reinvent the wheel of the emotional sports drama, but it certainly knows how to fine tune the formula in a very satisfying way."
Swagger,1,"Swagger offers up a lot to love, but it's the performances of O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Quvenzhané Wallis that carry the show from good to great."
Swagger,1,Swagger isn't just good - it's good in a way that scarcely seems possible for a freshman season.
Swagger,1,"The storytelling in 'Swagger' is nimble, unpredictable, and keeps me on my toes."
Swagger,1,A show that truly could have been a one-man drama that laser focuses on a young talent becomes a surprisingly rich ensemble piece.
Swagger,1,"Even when it seems obvious what will come out of Swagger's playbook next, the way it gets drawn up is often surprisingly satisfying."
Swagger,1,"ou find yourself rooting for the team and its star player, even if his ego is as a big as his voracious appetite."
Swagger,1,"Swagger might have one manufactured conflict too many, but when it settles into the stories that come naturally from these kids dealing with an uncertain future, it shines."
Swagger,1,"Swagger is a realistic look at how a talented kid becomes a superstar in the youth basketball world, but at least learns how to be a fully-realized person if basketball (more than likely) doesn't make him rich."
Swagger,1,Apple TV Plus has already produced a winning sports comedy in Ted Lasso; now the streamer gets to add one of the best sports dramas in recent years to its programming.
Swagger,1,"Whether you're a basketball junkie or a casual fan, Swagger is an instantly captivating and authentic dramatic ride."
Swagger,1,"With its powerful themes and sterling performances, the next great sports drama has arrived."
Swagger,0,"Every possible sports cliché lands with a thud, the dialogue is clunky and the attempt to frame the story as a rebellion against racism falls flat."
Swagger,1,"A lesser show might buckle under the weight of all such heavy-duty issues. But while Swagger does wobble here and there, it handles most of these plot points as deftly as its characters do a ball."
Swagger,1,It's a new era in sports; it only makes sense that the progress extends to sports drama.
Swagger,0,The diffuse focus makes the series too muddled to really latch on to any one narrative thread.
Swagger,1,"Crisp dialogue and winning performances, including by Quvenzhané Wallis... help it maintain interest."
Swagger,0,"For the most part, it plays more like a second-tier series than a blue-chip one."

1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything does a terrific job of living up to the big-ticket promise of its title. After these many months with no live music, it reminds us that music is more than entertainment. It's the sound of living."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"If you can look past the very US/UK-centric stance and the way that the focus is skewed by the willingness to participate of artists or their estates, this is a rock buff and pop-culture historian's treasure trove."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"This statement feels like an exaggeration, but as the 45-minute episodes unfold, the enormity of that single year's impact on not only music, but on global politics and culture, and vice versa, cannot be overemphasized."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"By lacking a clear narrative line or critical point of view, and grouping madly disparate events into broadly thematic episodes, it lacks focus and risks tokenism... But at its best, the series reminds you of the long histories of modern questions."

1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Part history lesson, part celebration of some truly iconic sounds."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"1971 wants to be both Ken Burns and VH1's Behind the Music. It could have been a great version of either one, but it's too thin to be both. Still, it hits the spot when it gets there."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"1971 feels immediate, exciting, confused, current - and it also feels like the stresses that impact culture today are the same ones that fuelled the tug-of-war between the establishment and counter-cultures of America and Britain 50 years earlier."

1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Every time I found myself wondering if 1971 was just the latest example of a megacorporation trying to sell boomers their own history in a shiny new package, it delivers a moment like David Bowie's unpolished, exquisite performance of Changes..."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"The clips throughout are eye-opening, from a joyous ""Soul to Soul"" concert by Stax artists in Ghana, to James Brown issuing ""Soul Power"" on Italian TV."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,1971: The Year Music Changed Everything is an excellent time capsule of music from a time which was a lot less innocent. How do we get that lack of innocence back?
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"The music is fantastic, the footage is generally superb, the editing is sharp and clever, and any music fan of a certain vintage should be happy just to strap in, turn up the volume, and turn back the clock to a time when pop still genuinely mattered"
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Perhaps foremost, ""1971"" reflects how music influenced the national agenda during that period, as exemplified by songs like John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"Some of the material has never before been presented publicly, and all of it stands well clear of overused sound and video bites and clichéd narratives."
1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,1,"It's a lot to take in, and almost sure to earn ""OK, Boomer"" eye-rolls from those who came along decades later. But ""1971"" starts with an outlandish claim and proceeds to do a pretty good job of backing it up."

Central Park,1,"Though it might be rather repetitive, with similar character tropes repeating themselves in the three shows, it hasn't lost its appeal so perhaps sometimes you can have a lot of a good thing."
Central Park,1,"Out of a park, Bouchard has built a universe. It’s a rare thing in TV. Sitcoms in the US are almost always about the three spheres of American life: work, school, and home."
Central Park,1,Season 2 is a wholesome continuation and a marked improvement.
Central Park,1,"Whether it's throwaway jokes or spotlight solos, the cast both elevate and benefit from Central Park's tight, confident writing."
Central Park,1,"Much like the Tillerman family themselves, this season of Central Park is only more confident in its voice and it continues to develop the optimistic animated series in a healthy direction."
Central Park,1,"Despite the lack of a substantial plot, Central Dark is still a good ol' time. And isn't that what's important?"
Central Park,1,"The show is fun, quirky, and a little edgier in its second season."
Central Park,1,"Season 2 bravely and joyfully takes Central Park into the hearts of the Tillerman family, who are just starting to see their power and realize the roles they were born to play."
Central Park,1,"Central Park took a big step forward in Season 2 by prioritizing its episodic arcs over its long-term storytelling; it's weirder, sharper, and more endearing."
Central Park,1,There is so much star power in Central Park you risk being blinded by their wattage.
Central Park,1,They do lean a bit too much into the music... but it's still a charming little show with a great cast and a lot of fun.
Central Park,1,"Season two explores these notions with emotional depth and backstory, which anchors its many moving parts."
Central Park,1,"All of these dynamics are carried over seamlessly from the first season, all used to generate episodes packed with seamlessly produced warmth, rat-a-tat jokes, and songs."
Central Park,1,"We know this grotesque Grinch will never succeed, but it's a hoot watching her try."
Central Park,1,"Full of more fantastic songs, a ton of humor, and a whole lot of heartwarming lessons. If Central Park keeps this up, it could have many more seasons in the future."
Central Park,1,The witty wordplay in the musical makes a great thoughtful comedic counterbalance to the bathroom gags.
Little America,1,"Reminds us of the beauty, differences, and commonalities between immigrant communities"
Little America,1,"Inspired by true stories ..., the Apple TV+ series celebrates immigrants. Their culture, values, hopes, fears, dreams, perseverance, way of life, [and] search for an identity."
Little America,1,"The key is in the chosen tone, without being showy or excessively sentimental. There's no big declarations other than the entrance to those private worlds, always seen with the eyes of those who arrive to stay. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Little America,1,Little America's greatest strength is its commitment to the stories we don't hear.
Little America,1,"The scope is modest, but the stories are large in a representative way, and sometimes funny and sometimes tragic."
Little America,1,"At its high points, the show is beautifully uplifting, never saccharine or melodramatic. It steers away from the overtly political or distressing, but characters' quiet heartbreak in the face of adversity makes for some of the most evocative scenes."
Little America,1,A joyous collection of portraits of immigrant experiences inspired by true stories.
Little America,1,"And, thanks to the wise and humane writing, all of the episodes have the reach and breadth of full-length movies."
Little America,0,"It's the best show Apple has produced so far, but it's also the most misguided. It almost hurts, considering the talent behind Little America."
Little America,1,A gorgeously human series.
Little America,1,Beautifully authentic anthology of immigrant stories.
Little America,1,"Its ambitions aren't flashy, but Little America leads with a clear investment in the kinds of people often relegated to the background of other shows. It's a smart, empathetic choice."
Little America,0,"Little America is muddled, with its baked-in politics directly in opposition to its ""positive"" message."
Little America,1,"Little America, despite how much the individual stories differ from each other, does tend to take a similar overall approach to each episode: They are sometimes predictable, rarely surprising, and generally brimming with positivity."
Little America,1,"They are ""hard work pays off stories,"" and they are ""immigration is hard"" stories, yes. But each of them is also much more lovely and painful and complicated than those easy summations."
Little America,1,"Every lithe episode is unique and hums with a different tone from one to the next, making this season a thematic quilt as opposed to one bolt of cloth."
Little America,1,"""Little America"" is a relevant and essential show."
Little America,1,"Each episode is an emotional and sweeping story, even if they are also small and contained. Little America is an exceptional series."
Little America,1,"Every episode boasts different writers, directors, actors, and DPs - all of whom produce peerless work, all of whom bring a sense of authenticity to the culture being explored, all of whom I need to see work more and more in 2020 and beyond."
Little America,1,Little America is without a doubt the best series on Apple TV+.
Little America,1,"Whatever its occasional stumbles, Little America can always fall back on its connection to flesh-and-blood human beings in all their quirks and complexities."
Little America,1,An absolute joy.
Little America,1,"It's a funny and bittersweet series, at once refreshing and achingly familiar-if at times a bit discomfiting in its careful avoidance of the uglier realities of living as a working-class immigrant in America."
Little America,1,All eight stories successfully straddle many fine lines. They are fleet - just half an hour long - without being insubstantial; uplifting without being schmaltzy; inspirational without being cringe-making.
Little America,1,"The result is a series of heartfelt stories, as uplifting as they are tearjerking. And, though it's early, the opening credits are among the most fun and inspired of the year."
Little America,1,"For the most part, these vignettes are thoughtfully and pleasingly rendered. But there is, at the same time, something too uniform about them, a predetermined style of grace, not unlike the stories you hear people tell about themselves"
Little America,1,"The individual stories are short and pithy. (One, set at a silent meditation retreat, feels like an extended setup for a punch line.) But collectively, the show's understanding of the immigrant experience is complex and nuanced."
Little America,1,"Each episode of Little America is based on a true story of an immigrant to the United States, and retold in a 30-minute block of inspiring, unwavering humanity filled with hope, humor, and joy."
Little America,1,"The subjects vary, but almost without exception the stories are quirky yet resonant, emotional and relatable, with a sweet (or occasionally slightly bittersweet) payoff."
Little America,1,Little America abstains from trying to deliver sweet generalizations about American immigration. The jumbled pictures of immigration it presents are too difficult to pin down.
Little America,1,"The funny, inspiring Little America tells immigrant stories that are pleasing without preaching..."
Little America,1,"Little America is smart, nuanced television."
Little America,1,"For a series comprised of such seemingly disparate cultural and geographical elements, there's a sense throughout of care for each installment."
Little America,1,"The key thing with Little America's anthology premise is that the number of stories it can tell, about different immigrants from different places experiencing America in different ways, is virtually limitless."
Little America,1,"Little America is a thoughtful show, made with evident care and consideration for doing justice to the heritages depicted."
Little America,1,It's a great show -- easily the best of Apple's early output... Those who take a look will find a lot to love in the way these distinct yet overlapping immigrant experiences make the specific universal and the universal specific.
Little America,1,"It's a beautiful, endearing show, one that never loses sight of its fascinating characters."
Little America,1,"Perhaps most importantly, ""Little America"" avoids becoming patriotic propaganda not by disparaging the United States and its policies (which it rarely does), but by selectively emphasizing what America can offer at its best."
Little Voice,1,"Like the music that weaves its way throughout the series, Little Voice is authentic, warm and captivating."
Little Voice,1,"Little Voice is sweet, genuine, and hopeful."
Little Voice,1,"Substance abuse, language, in sweet fable about stardom."
Little Voice,1,"At times the series can be far too self-indulgent, lingering for too long on a sequence as Bess struggles to write a song or find the perfect lyric. But for the most part the show's inherent earnestness is well suited for the story it is telling."
Little Voice,0,"Yes, those who love musical performances, New York, and the work of Sara Bareilles will likely find a lot to enjoy here, but overall Little Voice is mostly as a disappointment."
Little Voice,1,Little Voice is a charming coming-of-age tale which strikes just the right balance between winsome and world-weary.
Little Voice,1,"Above all, Little Voice is a show full of life and a profound love for what music means to those who devote their lives to its creation."
Little Voice,0,"You can slather a hip new coat of paint on it, but Little Voice is still familiar in every which way."
Little Voice,1,...this is a wistful yet sweet show about two types of voice: the little flame within us that can either grow or be stamped out and the little lies we tell ourselves in order to keep going.
Little Voice,1,"Little Voice is the sweet, hopeful antidote to our current moment."
Little Voice,1,"Like its heroine uses 80's covers out of fear of singing original songs, Little Voice is hiding behind a romance. Bess and Little Voice have more to say than they know, if only they stop hiding."
Little Voice,1,"Some of Little Voice's saccharine might get you in a grumpy mood, but Bareilles' music and O'Grady's performance will help with alleviate those grumpies pretty quickly."
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
Little Voice,0,"It can be a little wearing over the seasonal long haul, but it is true in its way to our sentimental experience and why nothing succeeds in working us up, and working us over, quite like a pop song."
Little Voice,1,"O'Grady is a captivating presence and does a believable job of capturing Bess in her fragile moments and her stubborn ones, even when the scripts require her to make those shifts a bit too abruptly."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
Little Voice,1,"A lambent little treasure of a new series. If, that is, you are willing to fall for its sunny optimism and heartfelt love of music of the musical-theatre and sensitive singer-songwriter genres."
Little Voice,0,Little Voice is little short of a horror show.
Little Voice,1,"Every scene with Valdez is wonderful - moving, funny, bittersweet. He is the real heart of ""Little Voice,"" regardless of who Bess winds up going with."
Little Voice,1,"Little Voice is a sweet, warm-hearted show, filled with natural performances and dotted with lovely songs. Its general willingness to leave story threads dangling makes the viewer feel she's been dropped into a true-ish tale of modern bohemia."
Little Voice,1,"While that may not sound like a great pitch for a TV series, the series will immediately grab your attention, and won't let go. It's an immersive experience from start to finish."
Little Voice,1,"While it often crosses the line into saccharine, Little Voice is an engine of joy, driven by great music and even catchier, unforgettable characters."
Little Voice,1,"There's both too much and not enough to Little Voice. Still, the show's good intentions, catchy tunes, and likable young cast smooth over some of the rough spots, particularly as the season progresses"
Little Voice,1,Little Voice mostly complies with brisk half-hour episodes that fly by so quickly you may not have time to be embarrassed by the occasional tear that gets jerked.
Little Voice,1,"I can't deny that ""overly earnest"" is far from my preferred love language and that Little Voice made me cringe frequently... I also can't deny that the show left me humming several tunes and that, in at least one moment, it induced blubbering."
Little Voice,1,"One thing that distinguishes ""Little Voice"" from other musical theater-meets-karaoke shows of its type is that it acknowledges its own crowd-pleasing tendencies."
Little Voice,1,"Little Voice is upfront about what it is: not just earnest, but charming, and more successful than not at exploring the inner life of a woman who can write songs that sound a lot like they've been on the radio for years."
Little Voice,1,"There's little enough realism intruding on Little Voice, though, to make it something of an escapist treat, and a musical one."
Little Voice,0,"Bess's songs always sound smooth and polished, which contradicts their supposed purpose as messy personal statements."
Little Voice,1,"The show is generally smart about how much it leans into its sentimentality, which ultimately befits its unabashedly enthusiastic characters. Sometimes it's subtle; often it's not; mostly, it's heartfelt."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,Stewart is a terrific interviewer but the show doesn't yet feel as fun or authoritative as Last Week Tonight.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Part of that may be because of the vitality of its guests, Jenifer Lewis and Bassem Youssef. Maybe ""the problem"" with the series is Stewart himself."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Whatever his own reservations about it all, For viewers, this new opportunity to see Stewart in all his guises is a welcome moment of zen."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Heartfelt though such conversations may be, they're also examples of everyone agreeing with each other. That unanimity of thought may be satisfying to some, but these discussions are hardly likely to make viewers question their own opinions."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Just because it isn't necessary doesn't mean it's not good, and for what it is - 60 Minutes with a profane, self-deprecating host - it is good... The other issue is this: There's nothing visually interesting."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Even in a TV world where lots of other shows are covering similar ground, it's a pleasure to see an old master like Stewart saddle up once again, trying hard to make an audience care about injustice and - just maybe - do something about it."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" does feel a little new-colt wobbly, and the host spends some time searching for his old rhythm, the soft-loud-soft approach, in which he rockets from calm to horror to a person crouched in a corner croaking ""help."""
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,The two episodes made available to reviewers are fascinatingly unpolished.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"It feels fantastic to luxuriate in the moments when Stewart lights up a powerful person to the point where they stammer. It gives off the illusion of a consequence. But Jon Stewart's value isn't as a tank, it's as an armory."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Dull and talky, with flashes of promise."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Just because ""Problem"" resembles much of what other comedians including Oliver, Seth Meyers and Samantha Bee are doing in the late-night talk show space doesn't mean that it has nothing to add to the conversation."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"It's a noble ambition, but one that surely Stewart must realize precious few viewers will stick around for without some jokes to leaven the proceedings."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"The Problem With Jon Stewart is ultimately more advocacy than activism, and while that's consistent with Stewart's past work, it lacks bite."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"This new show was going to be fun times again. Wrong. It's serious and, on the evidence of the first two episodes, all-over-the-place unfunny with a few joyless jokes sprinkled into it."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"The second episode, ""Freedom,"" is more emblematic of what the series could be. It's a withering take on the American right's response to the coronavirus pandemic that counters shouty talking points with acute logic."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"The show's success will ultimately depend on its specificity and timeliness. Despite its broad title, ""War,"" the burn-pit episode works because it tackles a particular, relatively manageable issue..."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Intelligence is at the root of Jon Stewart's funny, thought-provoking new series..."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"The Problem with Jon Stewart is a work in progress, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,Jon Stewart's new show didn't make me laugh. It made me cry.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Stewart has capitalized on the freedom that his reputation affords him in order to take this leap, doing something that's the equivalent of serving steamed vegetables to those fans who might have tuned in expecting salty snacks."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"This Stewart is more earnest than the shrugging news anchor helming the steep decline of America. It'll take time for the show to resolve into what it can do best, but in the meantime, it is nice to have him back around."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Viewers shouldn't approach this show with a ""entertain me, clowns!"" mindset... but with the steady hand of Stewart at the helm, even the bumpier, less funny episodes will be informative about issues that are pretty damned serious."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"Jon Stewart's voice may not necessarily be essential to today's TV landscape, but these episodes, hit-and-miss though they are, show how he might absolutely have value to add."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"In its initial outing, not a whole lot of The Problem feels particularly surprising or brand new. Its most immediately compelling aspect, then, is the restless undercurrent thrumming throughout."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Surprisingly, the comedy is the shakiest part early on... The second episode is more caustically funny but also more scattershot."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,1,"As a programme it is righteously furious about a worthy subject and, as a result, just a little dull. The second episode, Freedom, finds its groove and works much better."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
Long Way Up,1,"It never hurts that one of them bears an incredibly recognizable face, but even without that familiarity, Long Way Up proves an entertaining ride."
Long Way Up,1,"Friends bond, recharge electric Harleys in slow travel show."
Long Way Up,1,You'll see this offering from motorbike trek pals actor Ewan McGregor and presenter Charley Boorman as either the welcome return of a cheerful distraction or the unnecessary reminder of celebrity privilege. I lean to the former.
Long Way Up,1,Up has a feeling akin to catching up with old friends after a long gap and it quickly reminds you of what you enjoyed about spending time in the company of these two best mates.
Long Way Up,1,"Their epic adventure on bikes is more ""Dad joke"" sweetly nostalgic this time round."
Long Way Up,1,Electric motorcycles prove to be a challenge in the entertaining and highly enjoyable third chapter of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's travel series that'll please fans looking for adventure.
Amazing Stories,0,When this ending comes the audience may wish they'd have watched something more exciting instead.
Amazing Stories,0,"With only 52 minutes of running time, The Cellar feels like a TV movie condensed to the length of a TV episode. Its characters are painted in wide brush strokes."
Amazing Stories,0,"Amazing Stories may well be kicking against the gloomy, dystopian tone of modern anthology TV, but if it's to hold its head above water and justify its existence, it needs to at least try to be a bit more amazing and significantly less unexceptional."
Amazing Stories,1,"For now, I will remain cautiously optimistic that Steven Spielberg didn't attach his name to this show without checking the quality of the material, but you never know."
Amazing Stories,1,"On balance, a solid effort."
Amazing Stories,0,"The series might all be called Amazing Stories, But Not So Amazing That Heart Patients Can't Watch It."
Amazing Stories,0,"Some twists, mystery in tame but lackluster anthology."
Amazing Stories,1,Reasonably diverting and ultimately quite touching.
Amazing Stories,1,"Amazing Stories has become a combination of adolescent narratives and other genres that is not always effective, with added messages and teachings. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Amazing Stories,1,"The era may be different, the entertainment landscape may be overcrowded, and audience expectations may be high, but, after all this time, a simple need has persevered in the types of stories viewers flock to: connection"
Amazing Stories,1,"""The Cellar"" is a sweet and safe time-hopping love story that feels very on-brand for the type of out-there, ultimately unchallenging, tales Spielberg's original series was spinning back in the '80s."
Amazing Stories,1,"""Amazing Stories"" is pure escapism with a hopeful heart. It has no other purpose than to entertain."
Amazing Stories,0,"Maybe the show will get better; I hope it does. But with so many shows on so many different platforms right now, it seems like Amazing Stories blew its one chance to make a good first impression."
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
Amazing Stories,0,"It's too early to tell for sure, but the only amazing thing about ""Amazing Stories"" so far is that the new version retained and updated the original opening sequence, complete with that exciting musical theme by John Williams."
Amazing Stories,0,"The premiere episode has its virtues, starting with the solid promise and the romantic chemistry between the leads. Visually, however, it's not exactly dazzling."
Amazing Stories,0,"Fluffy and safe, it's not the strongest endorsement of what the rest of the series might bring."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
Amazing Stories,0,"Optimism isn't a bad thing to have on TV shows, but when that's the only thing you've got going for you, living up to ""amazing"" seems like a reach."
Amazing Stories,1,I like this reboot or at least like the idea of it.
Amazing Stories,0,"Ultimately, its central characters - Sam and Evelyn - never really come alive, and their love story is as generic as it comes."
Amazing Stories,0,"The show seems to be an intentional throwback, trading on Spielberg nostalgia to draw those who recognize the original, or just its family-friendly appeal, into Apple's orbit -- but it comes off more dated than deliberately retro."
Amazing Stories,1,The show is pulling out all the stops to stand out as a gorgeous series.
Amazing Stories,1,"You can trust that it'll be pleasant and wholesome and inoffensive -- good enough, in other words. But ""Amazing""? That's pushing it."
Amazing Stories,0,"I'm a fan of sci-fi anthologies, so I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of Amazing Stories in spite of its lukewarm opener episode."
Amazing Stories,1,"It's an unfashionable approach, of course, and maybe it does sit a little oddly with Apple's image and positioning as a new and thrusting arrival on the streaming scene. But you don't recruit Spielberg if you aren't looking for a product with heart."
Amazing Stories,0,Those tuning in expecting to see the director's light touch and clever manner of engaging our emotions will be disappointed: The show's first installment feels less like a revival than a holdover.
Amazing Stories,0,"Without spoiling too much,""The Cellar"" feels overstuffed with narrative jumps and character choices that are often puzzling."
Amazing Stories,1,"We're not looking for edge with Amazing Stories, but in 2020 even family-oriented shows should have more complex and less Hallmark-Channel-worthy stories than what we saw from the first episode."
Amazing Stories,0,"The opening episode is a story, certainly, but it isn't remotely amazing. Steven Spielberg's revival of his Eighties anthology series has been keenly awaited by viewers of a certain vintage. They are doomed to be disappointed."
Amazing Stories,0,The series apparently cost $5m per episode. It's hard to see where the money went. Certainly not on the script.
Amazing Stories,1,Its superpower is the diversity and strength of its writers and directors.
Amazing Stories,0,"Apple only provided the series' first episode for critics to review, so maybe the next four installments will be more creative and exciting."
Amazing Stories,0,"It seems like this is another example of Apple having great star power, but not knowing how to use it."
Amazing Stories,1,"The color, settings and lavish social detail are mainly what distinguishes this enterprise -- an adventure well worth an hour's viewing."
They Call Me Magic,1,Attractive yet conventional. [Full review in Spanish]
They Call Me Magic,1,"Magic's story on its own is so compelling that it's well worth becoming familiar with, but They Call Me Magic could've done a much stronger job of helping it resonate."
They Call Me Magic,0,"No disrespect to Magic Johnson on or off the court, but this very authorized love-in lacks the stakes or the drama of the Michael Jordan docuseries, The Last Dance."
They Call Me Magic,1,"Even those who are familiar with Johnson's career will likely find new wrinkles and anecdotes here thanks to the broad reach of the interviews. And besides, what basketball fan couldn't use an assist when it comes to putting more Magic in their lives?"
They Call Me Magic,1,"Call it nominative determinism, or simply a fair description, but the life and career of the man they named Magic Johnson has been nothing short of miraculous -- and this four-part docu-series proves it."
They Call Me Magic,0,"Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the cream, the best, on a level above the A list – but when there’s such an overwhelming winner, there’s no sport."
They Call Me Magic,1,They Call Me Magic gives fans a Magic whos more revealing than weve ever seen before.
They Call Me Magic,0,"If viewers don’t already know the stories Johnson has previously told, they’ll come away either feeling like Magic was pretty boring or like the truth was pretty boring."
They Call Me Magic,1,"The story itself, beyond the filler, is also surface-deep here... And yet, if you’re a basketball fan? You’ll still probably like this a lot. I know I did."
They Call Me Magic,1,"“Magic” gives us a lot of material, all of which creates a full-bodied portrait that leaves very little curiosity unanswered."
They Call Me Magic,0,"It's a story that could easily have been told within the confines of a traditional 90 minutes (or less), but the style nowadays is to stretch out the form in order to make it an event."
They Call Me Magic,1,"They Call Me Magic is both an engaging look at the impact this charismatic, endlessly newsmaking figure had on his era and an occasional glimpse into the mentality of a performer."
They Call Me Magic,1,"'They Call Me Magic' will inspire you to see a man who could have gone in a different direction with his life with the hand he was dealt. Instead, he turned and used that opportunity for the greater good. Its quite magical when you think about it."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"This terrific series gets off to a slightly inauspicious start with an exhausting cascade of soundbite after soundbite after soundbite... After that, though, it gets seriously fascinating."
Visible: Out on Television,1,Visible is a binge-worthy and entertaining series that shows the trajectory of LGBTQ lives both on and off screen and why queer stories need - and need to continue - to be told.
Visible: Out on Television,1,"It's a strong, beautiful statement about the transformative power of seeing yourself reflected in popular culture. The movement has come so far, but it still has further to go."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"It is a valuable documentary not only for its subject, but for its ability to walk, in a very pleasant way, through seventy years of TV history. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Visible: Out on Television,1,Docu series about LGBTQ TV history inspires and informs.
Visible: Out on Television,1,"It's gripping and touching and funny and heartwarming, but most impressively, it's unrelenting."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"While it feels like a 101-level course in LGBTQIA+ representation in TV, Visible: Out On Television is still a good overview of just how far the medium has come in this regard, and how far it has to go."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"Its in-depth study of a seemingly impossible subject to sum up is very impressive -- and, I daresay, necessary."
Visible: Out on Television,1,Visible is vital viewing for where we were and where we are.
Visible: Out on Television,1,"While the series doesn't break a ton of new ground in terms of the stories it tells, it makes up for that with an expansive amount of well-assembled archival footage, and by putting it all in one place."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"Occasionally, it defaults to broad brushstrokes... Still, it is an elegant education, and its vast library of footage makes for a smorgasbord of queer entertainment."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"While we remember many of these big moments, what White has done is to meticulously connect the dots -- drawing in lines that history has a way of rendering, well, invisible."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"Wonderfully thorough, powerfully outspoken and genuinely compelling."
Visible: Out on Television,1,"The series' interviewee roster is broad and deep, and everyone brings something to the table, be it their personal story or cultural criticism, or both."
The Me You Can't See,1,"Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry obviously aren't health experts, but they speak about mental health concerns in a way that is accessible and knowledgeable."
The Me You Can't See,1,"Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry are utterly compelling as they discuss their past traumas and mental health challenges in their well-intentioned three-part series aiming to help viewers identify, understand and get help for mental-health issues."
The Me You Can't See,1,A revealing look at mental illness and how our awareness of how pervasive it is in its many forms is just starting to develop.
The Me You Can't See,1,"We shouldn't face life's inevitable hardships and struggles alone. With 'The Me You Can't See,' now we don't have to."
The Me You Can't See,0,"As an exploration of trauma and mental health, however - and one that features testimonials from figures such as Lady Gaga and Glenn Close - it's frustratingly unambitious."
The Me You Can't See,1,The Me You Can't See is a very well-crafted show that can affect people emotionally while bringing necessary conversations to light.
The Me You Can't See,1,"If ""The Me You Can't See"" helps one person, this globe-spanning exercise was surely worth it. But strictly as a TV show, you're not missing much if you don't see it."
The Me You Can't See,1,It's oversights and choices like these that ultimately limit the series' exploration of mental health: what could have been a powerful call-to-arms ends up mired in a well-meaning limbo.
The Me You Can't See,1,"For all its clarity of vision and talk of a ""universal condition"", however, The Me You Can't See feels myopic on the burning issue that many, indeed most, people cannot afford years of therapy."
The Me You Can't See,1,"A sensitive, serious-minded look at mental health."
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
The Me You Can't See,1,"It's easy to be cynical about The Me You Can't See, despite its professional polish, undeniable poignancy and thoughtful inclusivity... And yet it can't be denied that Prince Harry is a surprisingly apt champion for seeking care."
The Me You Can't See,1,"A lot of people might believe in you, but all you need sometimes is for someone to believe you."
The Me You Can't See,1,"The Me You Can't See succeeds in chipping away at the stigma around mental health, even if the early episodes are a bit unbalanced."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"Lincolns Dilemma addresses Abraham Lincoln with respect, and acknowledges what he realistically accomplished during his presidency, as well as the fact that the long-held myths about him were not of his own making."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,The diversity of voices speaking to the issue of Lincoln and emancipation is astonishing.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,Even the most devoted amateur historians will learn something new from this series.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,Lincoln's Dilemma should be required viewing.
Lincoln's Dilemma,0,"For the first 3 1/2 episodes, the filmmakers and contributing scholars do a reasonably good job of appearing unbiased...Where they drop the ball in a major way is in the last 15 minutes when their unabashed, vainglorious stripes are revealed."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,Lincoln's Dilemma presents a more comprehensive view of the Black experience during the Civil War as part of its narrower focus on Lincoln's presidency and the war as opposed to expressly profiling the man.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,It’s not ineffective; the subject matter makes it interesting. We’ve just seen this kind of thing before.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"While it seems that it would make for a drier show, quite the opposite happens: The straightforward approach makes Lincoln’s Dilemma a dramatic and compelling watch."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,Lincoln’s Dilemma asks viewers to see Abraham Lincoln in all his complexities. It widens the lens to celebrate people that pushed a president and a nation to do better.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"The docuseries is at its best, dramatically speaking, in its history of all that led to the outbreak of the Civil War -- a concise narrative that succeeds in capturing the tone and flavor of the times"
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,Lincoln's Dilemma shows the importance of studying history because some of his flaws were never taught in schools.
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"The series is beautifully constructed, artistic, surprising, the interviewees well-chosen, and the unfolding of American history we thought we knew."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"Its willingness to live in unresolvedness makes Lincoln’s Dilemma a contemplative, challenging watch."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"Lincoln’s Dilemma brings history to life, raising new points for discussion, and suggesting why so many people in this nation are still not united over the basic fundamental rights that all people should enjoy."
Lincoln's Dilemma,1,"A big part of what makes Lincoln’s Dilemma so interesting is in the way it uses historical context and, often, Lincoln’s own words to nudge aside the myth and instead provide an honest, unflinching yet respectful assessment of the human being behind it."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"The spirit of Jim Henson is alive and well in this thoughtful and joyous entry into the Fraggle universe. It takes complex concepts and handles them in a simultaneously contemplative, family friendly, and amusing manner. Back to the rock ROCKS."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"[A] joyous series, which has returned at just the right moment."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"Every facet of the show is polished until it gleams. The puppets are beautifully made and lifelike. It's always a pleasure watching professionals practice their craft, and the puppeteers here are at the top of their game."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"Fraggle Rock: Back To The Rock has all the charm that made the original series so popular, and it's made in a way that it's completely easy to make a new generation of fans get into the show immediately."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"Good music, lots of fun, and lot of the original voice cast is back. I enjoyed it."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"These new episodes are genuinely funny, visually engaging, and entirely heartwarming. And the large and small messages put forth in every episode are earnest and needed in our times more than ever."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,Introduce this show to the children in your life.
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"""Back to the Rock""... has been made with a believer's fealty to the original, in terms of character, humor - it's very funny - and its main message: We are all connected and must learn to listen."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"It's a delightful experience, no matter your age."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,This incarnation of the beloved Jim Henson classic is smart enough not to break what already worked so well.
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"Dance your cares away: it's nearly impossible to hear the Fraggle Rock theme and not be filled with joy, and this reboot lives up to the warm fuzzy feelings that nostalgic grown-ups feel towards the show."
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,Back To The Rock reinforces the scale of Henson's original achievement while (subtly) broadening the scope of the series' storytelling.
Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,1,"Has catchy music and silly antics, but most importantly this show teaches children to care for each other despite our differences -- and to care for the environment as well."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"But rather than coming off as a boring-but-useful YouTube tutorial, Watch the Sound remains engaging and approachable, even when it gets technical."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"A highly illuminating little series in which super-producer Mark Ronson and a small host of big-name musicians show exactly how effects and inventions such as autotune, reverb, synthesisers and samplers actually work."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"All of this stuff is absolutely fascinating, and it's rare to feel quite so gripped (or indeed educated) by a music series on TV."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"The series takes on a feeling of intimacy and urgency that is absent from most talking heads docs, and allows it to bring new insight to well-covered topics and travel to illuminating places that others would never be able to reach."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"Each episode ends with a song that Ronson constructs using the chosen theme, which, thankfully, it never gets in the way of the story telling and doesn't come across as gimmicky."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"The show's format can be playful, too. In a clever illustration of the topic at hand, an installment on sampling fills transitions between segments with collages of sounds and images from other parts of the episode."
Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,1,"It is clear that Ronson lives and breathes music, and some of the best moments are when he lets himself geek out to the fullest."
The Offer,1,"…the appeal may be limited to the many who know the film, but it’s also slick, glossy entertainment with a fun take on Hollywood excess in collision with real world gangsters…"
The Offer,1,"It's like Al: it prioritizes getting ahead no matter the cost and avoids getting too deep into the emotional edges of the characters and their conflicts, resulting in an engaging, intense story with some humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Offer,1,"More important, though, is how well the series works on its own terms as a drama: the skill of the storytelling; the quality of the filmmaking and the performances; the shaping of the material; the ideas that reverberate through it."
The Offer,1,"While the protracted dramatisation may draw you out, there are enough strong moments to pull you back in..."
The Offer,1,Brings to us an almost unbelievable story. All kinds of authenticity going on here from the period perfect costumes and sets.
The Offer,1,A consistently entertaining retelling of the momentous story behind the making of one of the greatest movies of all time.
The Offer,1,"This is a rambling, indulgent re-telling of events. But it is also a hell of a lot of fun."
The Offer,1,A delight for cinephiles. [Full review in Spanish]
The Offer,1,"Gripping behind the scenes intrigue, & the fantastic cast pulls it off beautifully … Miles Teller is a great anchor as Albert Ruddy & Brit Matthew Goode, portraying the incredible Robert Evans, has the time of his life in his performance. 1970s Groovy!"
The Offer,1,With 10 hour episodes this series is a gigantic undertaking and we’re seeing the emerging problems the script has in following three distinct story lines that all have to mesh.
The Offer,1,The Offer is a worthwhile watch even if it stumbles along the way with its storytelling and some one-note portrayals of key figures.
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
The Offer,0,"If The Godfather was masterful and precise despite its famously harrowed production, The Offer is amateurish and messy because of the way it uses its sure-fire assets."
The Offer,1,Must-see television. It would be an absolute crime to miss it.
The Offer,0,"The Offer certainly didnt have Coppolas blessing, and I hope this wasnt the reason behind his problematic portrayalhe is shown not as an angsty New Hollywood artist, but as a comedic buffoon."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
The Offer,1,"It’s uneven, but a handful of solid performances anchor it with a fine showing by Teller."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
The Offer,0,Its goofy failures create a veritable list of guidelines of how not to tell a story when otherwise trying to get across how hard it is to make a movie in Hollywood.
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
The Offer,1,"Even when it flies off the rails fudging facts about the mob and movie-making, this flawed but fascinating series about the creation  of The Godfatheran enduring screen classic even after 50 yearsis still an offer no movie fan can refuse."
The Offer,1,"""The Offer"" lacks the patient artistry of Coppola's masterpiece, but as a nostalgic look at the behind-the-scenes machinations of a pivotal period of Hollywood and the battle between artistic expression vs. commercial imperative, its still pretty fun."
The Offer,0,"This Seventies flashback tries to hit a lot of marks at once... The only way it genuinely works, however, is as a parody of prestige TV."
The Offer,1,"This 10-part look back at Hollywood in the swingin' '70s is mostly good fun, anchored by Matthew Goode's appropriately scenery-devouring turn as Paramount boss Robert Evans."
The Offer,1,"Why is The Offer recommended viewing? Matthew Goode. He's so good as longtime producer and Paramount Studios head Robert Evans that you cannot take your eyes off of him, and anything that doesn't work about The Offer is swept under the rug."
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
The Offer,0,"Strange pacing and unnecessary subplots bog down The Offer's more enjoyable moments, turning what could have been a thrilling look at movie history into an uneven television show."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
The Offer,0,"Repetitive for anyone who’s seen the film, and condescendingly didactic for those who haven’t."
The Offer,0,Too long by half and romanticizes its subject.
The Offer,1,"All criticisms – and there are many – aside, the Offer remains watchable to the bloated end."
The Offer,1,"Godfather cultists, and we are legion, will find the entire 10-part dramatic series -- presented by the studio that almost didn’t make the movie -- not just impossible to refuse, but nerve-racking."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
The Offer,1,"if you're a fan of ""The Godfather,"" Hollywood, gangsters or even just movies in general, ""The Offer"" has lots to, well, offer...it's a love-letter to movie-lovers."
The Offer,1,"But even with -- or maybe because of -- some over-the-top performances and exaggerations (Ruddy's recollections have been questioned by others with knowledge of The Godfather filming), The Offer keeps chugging along."
The Offer,0,"It suffers, like so much in the streaming world, from repetition and extreme overlength..."
The Offer,0,"The Offer is an illustrated Wikipedia entry stretched illogically to 10 hours by pandering to cinema fans with endless winking and nudging, and with performances that range from likably cartoonish to Madame Tussauds in a heatwave."
The Offer,0,"What unremarkably ensues is a kind of broad and tacky Godfather cosplay with zero subtext, nothing to say and very little to aspire to other than telling an increasingly self-satisfied tale of how The Godfather was made."
The Offer,1,"If the show were just a little tighter in pace, a little more grounded in fact, itd be an easy recommend to any cinephiles interested in this particular period of film history."
The Offer,0,Am offer you can refuse.
The Offer,1,"While there is a lot of intriguing elements to this story, the overlong The Offer is good but not impossible to refuse."
The Offer,1,"If you’ve got an irrational love of the very concept of filmmaking or a soft spot for longshots that feel like sure things in hindsight, this might be for you. Yet, if you’re looking for the next great prestige miniseries, The Offer probably isn’t it."
The Offer,0,"A soulless, vapid piece of Content™ that’s about as far removed from “art” as professionally produced television can get."
The Offer,1,The Offer is a nail-biting and exhilarating exploration into the making of one of the most iconic and influential films of the 20th century.
The Offer,1,"As a Hollywood history lesson, The Offer makes a lot of shortcuts. But as an ensemble buddy story, it's consistently charming."
The Offer,0,The series bombards the viewer with stylish characters with puffed-up egos who battle for control of The Godfather.
The Offer,1,"While it obviously won't measure up to the majesty of its famous subject, this highly watchable glimpse into the magic of movies makes an offer that's hard to refuse."
The Offer,0,A Limited Series That Should've Been A Movie.
The Offer,0,"With disconnected subplots, tensionless drama, and empty Easter Eggs galore, The Offer tries to weave a fictitious story about how The Godfather was made, while also trying (and failing) to match the movies stature as a sprawling gangster saga."
Evil,1,"Finds David at a crossroads, with his disillusionment with the Catholic Church increasing rather than diminishing."
Evil,1,"So many horrible things keep happening on Evil, yet everyone always seems to be having fun. Joy this nasty is positively blasphemous."
Evil,1,"Evil, since its start, has always been an intriguing blend of frightening and weird, something that has only grown since switching from CBS proper to Paramount+. That shows no sign of slowing down here."
Evil,1,"Kristen is the best antihero on television, somewhere between audience surrogate and actual demon, impossible to track and thrilling to watch."
Evil,1,"Ever the capable procedural, Evil has finally found the sweet spot of how to layer in its serialized touches and glimpses of past run-ins."
Evil,1,"Evil continues its smart combination of weekly cases with strong character arcs, all with the Kings’ dry sense of humor intact..."
Evil,1,"Evil remains one of the most clever, witty, and cerebral horror television series, period. Creators Robert and Michelle King and their writers continue to swing for the fences when it comes to mixing procedural stories with existential themes."
Evil,1,"The series, about a group of investigators of the supernatural for the Catholic Church, gets weirder and more daring with each season."
Evil,1,"I'm firmly convinced that no other show out there is doing it exactly like Evil, and three seasons in, that still remains true."
Evil,1,A show that’s alive with ideas ... with a cast that’s entirely on the same page.
Evil,1,"Evil is still a singular beast in how it scrutinizes the nature of, well, evil—whether supernatural or manmade—with thoughtful introspection."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Forget timelines, just enjoy the fun ride..."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Though Strange New Worlds doesn’t quite reach the heights of TOS (not original enough? Not camp enough? Who can say?), it still delivers a consistently good time, as well as that signature Star Trek sense of wonder and optimism we’ve been craving."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"This back-to-basics prequel embodies a lot of the best of the original Star Trek with its charming ensemble and episodic structure - but it also managed to dredge up some 1960s morality, too, with its questionable depiction of disability"
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Comfort blanket Trek with a great cast, snappy writing and plenty of strands to unwind in future episodes, Strange New Worlds achieves everything it intends. But there’s a lingering feeling that there’s perhaps not quite enough that’s strange or new."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"The pilot plot was complicated, and the show style is more gung-ho oriented than TOS  – Nurse Chapel, for example, is like a action star banshee – but the potential is all there with the familiarity of the Enterprise and its ongoing mission. KIIIIIIIIRK!"
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,This show understands that you can be earnest and you can be goofy and you can still tell really good and entertaining stories.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Strange New Worlds feels like Trek. No matter if you like new Star Trek or original Star Trek. Strange New Worlds seamlessly weaves old and new together.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Recovers the pulp spirit of the original series which, even with its well-intentioned pacifist, anti-racist messages and in favor of scientific progress and mutual understanding, was, above all, an adventure story. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Able to hit that sweet spot between the fans of the new Trek and that old-school Trek fan who wants it to be more like the original series and the Next Generation.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"""Perhaps what Star Trek needed all along was a return to what made it so memorable in the first place. Strange New Worlds delivers that and then some."""
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,This series is a refreshing return to the original style of Star Trek through a 21st-century lens in a way J.J. Abrams’ reboot was unable to replicate. Trek purists will love this show and I hope new fans do as well.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Enjoy Star Trek: Strange New Worlds for the blending of old and new it represents.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"If you’re already a “Trekkie” then “Strange New Worlds” will feel like a welcome, if familiar snack. For newcomers this might still be an enjoyable first “Star Trek” series to start watching every week."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"“Strange New Worlds” captures a lot of the humor, emotion, adventure and, perhaps most surprisingly, the optimism of the old shows."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"With a stellar cast, Strange New Worlds proves smaller is better when it comes to Star Trek. While the Paramount+ series is more appealing to new and casual fans, it’s also a throwback that doesn't leave longtime fans behind."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,0,Much of what the series offers can’t help but come off as clever franchise strategizing.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"By pulling from the earliest days of Star Trek, Strange New World manages to walk the tightrope between showcasing what has always made Star Trek great, while boldly forging a new path forward for the franchise."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"After years of up-and-down, divisive, serialized storytelling, the latest ‘Star Trek’ series triumphantly returns the franchise to its familiar, episodic roots."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"It's off to a promising start, with a solid crew brimming with potential. By going back to the past, Strange New Worlds points the way to a brighter future."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Just one season of Strange New Worlds delivers enough memorable moments and stirring performances to put Christopher Pike in the conversation when discussing the franchise’s most revered captains.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Taking big swings, Strange New Worlds wastes no time in bringing in elements to the show that may not resonate with every viewer. But the risks are risks well taken, resulting in a Star Trek show unlike any of the others before it."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Strange New Worlds puts a modern spin on classic franchise territory. Its real trump card, however, may turn out to be its crew, with Anson Mount’s charismatic, authoritative Captain Christopher Pike the standout."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"A direct prequel populated by younger versions of characters like Spock and Uhura, it's hardly a bold construct but it's mostly an entertaining one."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Strange New Worlds is, at last, a return to the episodic self-contained storytelling that made this franchise so much fun in the first place."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Strange New Worlds comes closest in tone and storytelling style to the original series and the 1990s Next Generation-era shows, but its too-long episodes sometimes feel as plodding as the other recent “Treks."""
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is perfectly fine, but that makes it seem way better when graded on the recent curve of Star Trek offerings."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Oh, joy! A “Star Trek” origin story that captures the humanism, humor and impulse to connect of the original while smoothly “assimilating” into the larger “Star Trek” universe."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is a return to the classic Trek that audiences know and love. It revels in its throwbacks and brings a modern-day sensibility to the development of its classic characters.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is finally here and breathes new life in classic characters and elements from Star Trek history to great effect.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"After a string of spinoffs characterized by gritty darkness or twisty mythologizing, Paramount+ may have cracked the Star Trek code with a new series that’s bright, optimistic and fundamentally episodic in nature."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"It’s almost startling how effective the old format is after all this time. The early episodes of Strange New Worlds have a little bit of everything the franchise has tried over the years: exploration, diplomacy, action, even comedy."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"There is enough of William Shatner’s puckishness in Mount that one may easily forget that this is the Pike and Spock Show, and not the Kirk and Spock Show."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"This latest addition to the Star Trek franchise feels fresh, invigorating and endlessly engaging."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,It’s all so beautifully made that even the few moments that feel contrived are more than forgivable.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"""New"" is right there in the title, but this latest Trek marks the fullest embrace of the canon's history ever, really."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Strange New Worlds is content to fall back on the basics: a likable cast traveling the galaxy, having wacky sci-fi adventures, and generally having a hell of a good time. By and large, this approach works."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Funny, inspiring, and kind of amazing, Strange New Worlds is, so far, the best new Trek in years."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"""Strange New Worlds"" is, quite simply, the best ""Star Trek"" show in decades."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"Smart, addictive and flat out fun, Strange New Worlds is the best Star Trek series since The Next Generation and acts as a faithful love letter to the original."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,“Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” leverages audience familiarity in a manner that’s welcoming rather than suffocating.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"It's not mere nostalgia that's powering Strange New Worlds' warp core, it's also the simplicity of its premise: The Enterprise Before Kirk."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,1,"While Star Trek: Strange New Worlds must stick to canon and Pike's fate, the show offers a contemporary vibe as fans get to visit new worlds and cultures."
Halo,0,"As a sci-fi show that wants to deliver something more rewarding than its source material, it’s too slow to load."
Halo,1,"Hail to the Chief? Not quite, but despite some uneven plotting, this is a worthy adaptation that promises better things to come."
Halo,0,I can safely say that the major flaw in this series is not the lack of accuracy or loyalty to the source material (though that certainly hurt it) but it is the lack of heart in the series.
Halo,1,"While I understand that Halo Season 1 needed to build upon a universe and build up to a Season 2 that’s grander in scope, it is abundantly clear that the show is at its best when it embraces that it is, in fact, Halo..."
Halo,1,Complicated like a toxic hook-up is complicated. Is this person bad for you? Yes. Is the sex great? Meh. But are you intrigued just enough to keep them around to see where it goes? Absolutely.
Halo,1,"Better than its detractors suggest without ever being quite as good as it should be, Halo succeeds as a TV show thanks in large part to its perfectly cast leading man and first-rate production values."
Halo,0,"Ultimately, Halo’s alien problem feels like a symptom of the show’s biggest problem.It is so deeply incurious about the ideas defining these characters’ lives that they become virtually meaningless."
Halo,1,"While it holds almost no reverence for its source material, and features some unnecessary plots, Halo: The Series still manages to tell a strong sci-fi tale about free will that forges its own path forward."
Halo,1,"Halo jukes away from what fans knew of the game's canon, but its literal and metaphorical undressing of its iconic main character is its biggest strength."
Halo,1,Its certainly not the kind of disaster that typically emerges when video games launch into other mediums. Only time will tell if fans want to keep watching or just wish they were still playing
Halo,1,"Overall, it admirably delivers an experience that does right by Master Chief's most loyal fans, while also inviting newcomers to dive into its engrossing universe."
Halo,0,How the show is written demonstrates a very rudimentary style of storytelling that values embellished dramatic flare over an authentic episodic experience.
Halo,1,The premise is familiar but the effects and creature designs are great.
Halo,1,"Schreiber makes John more than the automaton he’s been made into, even from the first minutes he’s on screen."
Halo,1,"A decent start that, despite its best efforts, failed to stun me. But it didn't drive me away, either."
Halo,0,"The derivative touches can't help but make the whole exercise feel generic, exhibiting a lot of hardware but not much creative spark."
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
Halo,1,"While I’m not ready to get down on one knee and offer the Halo series a “sacred ring,"" I can commit to checking out more episodes as their fresh ideas unfold."
Halo,1,"Where this all goes and whether the balance tips more toward character and story or more toward video game-like battle scenes is unclear, but if the first two episodes are any indication, character stories will win out."
Halo,0,Looks like a trial run that ran out of gas about halfway through.
Halo,0,"The video game Halo excelled at letting players become the hero  with the new Halo TV series, audiences are instead saddled with a series devoid of a soul."
Halo,0,"Between the series’s somewhat nondescript visual style and its overwhelming exposition, Halo is bogged down by world-building and almost hampered by its source material."
Halo,1,It's very possible the series will manage to chart its own path through a science-fiction landscape littered with many of the very same cast-off machine parts it once helped to create.
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
Halo,1,"Halo has had a bumpy road to the screen, but fans new and old alike should be more than entertained by the explorations of Master Chief and his evolving world."
Halo,1,"If video game fans can keep an open mind and the series can garner enough attention from sci-fi fans less familiar with canon, “Halo” has the potential to be Paramount+’s flagship series."
Halo,1,"The world-building is impressive, and Pablo Schreiber is an excellent choice for Master Chief. A few ideas do not translate as well as they intend, but the potential is there."
Halo,1,Paramounts adaptation of the mega-hit video game series shines when digging into the Master Chiefs long-suppressed sense of self and the schemes of the galaxys power players.
Halo,1,Has potential but the jury is still out.
Halo,0,"Even to an Xbox novice, the idea of Master Chief on the run already sounds like it's not HALO."
Halo,1,"Halo is shamelessly derivative, but it is fun to watch. It's like a TV-MA version of Star Wars. It's a Steven Spielberg-produced blockbuster show that feels more like it came from his pal George Lucas."
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
Halo,1,The Paramount+ series faithfully reproduces the video game’s world and thrills—and features a commanding lead turn from Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief.
Halo,0,I dont see much in these early episodes to make investing in a full season worthwhile. Halo does not come remotely close to any of the other sci-fi or fantasy series out there and represents yet another mediocre video game adaptation.
Halo,1,"The series has more of The Mandalorian vibe.  For genre fans, they will get what they came for out of the Halo series. As an adaptation, gamers will have to adjust their expectations and keep an open mind while enjoying the Easter Eggs."
Halo,0,"Extremely generic sci-fi, and incredibly different from the source material in ways that are not justified.  This just doesn't cut it in the ultra competitive streaming arena."
Halo,1,What we see is intriguing and demonstrates how there is a lot of potential for this Halo adaptation to thrive where many other forgotten attempts have failed.
Halo,1,"Halo (2022) works for me, and I hope it works for you, or at very least you open yourself to allowing a new story to be told for a franchise we all hold dear."
Halo,1,"Having seen roughly two hours of Halo, I am confident enough in it to say that I will be sticking around to finish the fight."
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
Halo,1,The result is a series that manages to evoke many of the core themes and the visuals of the video games while also delivering a compelling narrative.
Halo,1,"Will it end up propagandistic and committing to an idea that some of the excesses of warfare are necessary or acceptable? Almost definitely. But it’ll probably be a fun ride, and hopefully a good story."
Halo,1,"The Halo TV series leaves a lot to be desired, but there are signs of better things to come."
Halo,0,This drama comes on strong with ambient techno-babble and bureaucratic realism. It's as thrilling as a meeting.
Halo,1,"As much as the premiere focuses on capturing the iconic weapons and technology from the games, it also shows a willingness to move its story in dramatically different directions."
Halo,0,"It’s exactly what you expect. While Halo features a few minor pivots in these early hours, there’s very little to spoil and even less to spark curiosity that’s not already present."
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
Halo,0,"This adaptation offers a lot of explanations and fun effects but little else. Halo has the potential to be good time, but at least in its first episodes, it’s not quite there yet."
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
Halo,1,"The series boasts an impressive budget used wisely, with distinct production design distinguishing one planetary location for another and spaceships zipping through endless stars. That alone lets Halo keep apace with its contemporaries."
Halo,1,"Packed with action, adventure, and so many video game references, this series is a fan's dream come true...but also a great introduction to the franchise for newcomers."
Halo,1,"With gorgeous production design, impressive visuals and thrilling action -- not to mention a solid cast and a healthy respect for its roots as one of the most successful video game franchises in history -- Halo is off to a very auspicious beginning."
Yellowjackets,1,"A chilling, perceptive, resonant and potent must-see from its very first episode."
Yellowjackets,1,"It's pure entertainment.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets is an addictively compelling drama...
Yellowjackets,1,"A dazzling blend of mystery and character that evokes the best seasons of Lost. Hats off to the actors, particularly Lynskey and Ricci, who absolutely steal the show."
Yellowjackets,1,Lord of the Flies is probably the best metaphor we've got for what happens when society breaks down and humans return to our most primal urges. Yellowjackets takes that concept in a particularly dark direction.
Yellowjackets,1,"Addictive and unsettling, Yellowjackets is must-see-TV of the highest order."
Yellowjackets,1,"Theres no shortage of intrigue, stellar writing, and knock-out performances to keep you glued to the screen."
Yellowjackets,1,"An uncanny mix of implacable horror, conspiracy-laded mystery, and barbed character comedy. It’s as adept at making you scream with fear as scream with laughter, then it lets you question what really divides the two."
Yellowjackets,1,"The brilliance of Yellowjackets is that you know these girls will descend into madness, and yet you come to love them knowing the ritualistic cannibalism that awaits them."
Yellowjackets,1,"A series that is able to use multiple timelines and elements of different genres effectively, that can keep you guessing and theorizing through clever storytelling and not just by being confusing."
Yellowjackets,1,"The series is a deliciously dark survivalist drama that captures grief, gore and girlhood in a way fit for pure escapism."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets is the best new television show in a decade, with one of the strongest pilots ever made."
Yellowjackets,1,...viewers willing to indulge the show's occasional storytelling excesses will be rewarded with a fresh take on the survival horror genre that's driven by a strong story and even stronger performances.
Yellowjackets,1,"Unlike most puzzle box thrillers, Yellowjackets is not interested in endlessly teasing the viewer with what happened, but in investing them in the how and the why."
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets is a twisted treat for people who seek out the dark side of streaming. It's completely original and thoroughly deranged in all the right ways.
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets is your new favorite show, or it will be once you sit down and watch it."
Yellowjackets,1,"It's William Golding meets Alive meets Heathers meets P.J. Harvey and all your favourite 1990s rock goddesses (the soundtrack is great) meets Midsommar meets Bear Grylls. You never get bored, that's for sure."
Yellowjackets,1,"Gruesome, gripping and blackly comic, this tightly-plotted mystery-horror is meaty in all the right (and wrong) ways."
Yellowjackets,1,"The cast of Yellowjackets is a delight and totally unpredictable, to the point that I’d watch for the Riverdale-style drama alone."
Yellowjackets,1,"The larger Yellowjackets discussion isn’t just about the parasocial adoption of others’ trauma, but the way we talk about the girls and the show and regress into a deliriously unhinged version of the ’90s that I didn’t even know I wanted, and it rules."
Yellowjackets,1,"Once you get past the abject horror of each episode and its corresponding plot revelations, there is an absolutely genius undercurrent of dark humor that threads its way through the show making it well worth multiple rewatches."
Yellowjackets,1,"The show puts a fiendishly clever twist on a familiar set-up, which makes for an experience as morbidly addictive as tracking Omicron figures every morning."
Yellowjackets,1,"This is a great, entertaining show that could go in so many different directions. It's built up in really surprising ways, with lots of head fakes and red herrings and some surprising twists and turns."
Yellowjackets,1,"In this stew of hormones, gore, and mordant farce, the series captures the way that growing out of girlhood is an inherently brutal and absurd process."
Yellowjackets,1,Lynskey's character is one of the most interesting: a mix of desperate housewife and intriguing shadowy strategist. [Full review in Spanish]
Yellowjackets,1,"Is there five seasons' worth of story to be found there? We don't know, but when actresses like Melanie Lynskey, Tawny Cypress, Christina Ricci and Juliet Lewis are doing the telling we're more than ready to settle in for the long haul."
Yellowjackets,1,The season climaxes with a bravura sequence of desire and ultraviolence...
Yellowjackets,1,"The high I feel about Yellowjackets right now may not last. But for the first time in ages, it feels earned, and I just want more people to talk to me about precisely how good it feels."
Yellowjackets,1,"It's a fast, freaky ride. Strap on those oxygen masks; it's about to, quite literally, go down..."
Yellowjackets,1,"One of the wildest shows of 2021! With a stellar ensemble, [Yellowjackets is] a can't miss show that will keep you guessing every week."
Yellowjackets,1,These unsavory hooks make Yellowjackets an appropriately suspenseful companion to Showtime's rebooted Dexter: New Blood.
Yellowjackets,1,"""Yellowjackets"" is many things, including my favorite new mystery drama of the year."
Yellowjackets,1,"Creators and showrunners Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson are quick to dole out the plot twists, too, while ably balancing timelines and a parade of complicated lead characters. An hour with these women flies by."
Yellowjackets,1,"While the pulpy show is an addicting psychological thriller, the ultimate lifeline that makes it standout from other survival series is that it's really about the humanity of these women, and to the degrees in which it's tainted."
Yellowjackets,1,"In its first two episodes, 'Yellowjackets' provides an unsettling mystery between two times periods that you can't wait to get to the bottom of."
Yellowjackets,1,"A genre mash-up of survival drama, teenage high-school movie, gory horror flick, with a dab of The Blair Witch Project, it is much better than that unholy mess sounds on paper."
Yellowjackets,1,There's a hell of a lot going on. But it had me gripped.
Yellowjackets,1,I'm here to proselytize the cult ofYellowjackets.
Yellowjackets,1,Terrific characters and performances and darkly compelling back story make for immediately engrossing viewing.
Yellowjackets,1,"There's so much to enjoy about Yellowjackets, and I can't wait to see where the series takes us."
Yellowjackets,1,Genuinely frightening and thoroughly unmissable.
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets is a brutal coming-of-age story for adults who must reckon with the sins they committed to survive.
Yellowjackets,1,"Comparisons to Lord of the Flies might be inevitable considering the crux of the story, but where Yellowjackets succeeds as a survival drama is in the minutiae."
Yellowjackets,1,A killer hook cemented by killer performances and one of the best pilots in recent years...
Yellowjackets,1,I cannot stress this enough: Go watch Yellowjackets. Immediately.
Yellowjackets,1,"I know that ""Lord of the Flies but with girls"" is also the concept for The Wilds, but honestly? I'm here for it."
Yellowjackets,1,"I've only seen one episode, but am 100 per cent onboard for wherever this series is going."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets does a good job at tackling three genres at once. It's a thriller, a coming of age story and a survival story, and all of it is presented in a way that makes us want to see more."
Yellowjackets,1,"At once fast-paced and slow-burning, Yellowjackets benefits from some smart casting between the younger and older versions of the characters and the impressive eclectic ensemble of former '90s ""stars"" that have been gathered together."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets will obviously be compared to ABC's Lost, for its plot surrounding how a group of people survived a plane crash, but the Showtime series seems to be more properly packed for its high-concept scenario."
Yellowjackets,1,In the short term Yellowjackets holds all the essential ingredients needed to brew a thriller worth investing in.
Yellowjackets,1,"As creators, Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson put forth a solid cocktail of genres. [Full review in Spanish]"
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets is all kinds of fun, focused on a messy story and the messy people who rose from the ashes of it."
Yellowjackets,1,"It's the kind of show that borrows from so many others that it feels mostly original again, though its most direct influence is ""Lost."""
Yellowjackets,1,"What makes this patchwork of styles, tones and time periods hang together is the thread of psychological realism that runs through every scene."
Yellowjackets,1,"While 'Yellowjackets' features strong performances from its leads and poses intriguing questions about human nature pushed to extremes, ultimately it feels crowded with too many plot points and characters."
Yellowjackets,1,It really might be the next Lost. Just don't say that too loudly. You don't want to jinx it.
Yellowjackets,1,"It's a murder mystery. It's a feminist fable. It's a political drama. It's a coming-of-middle-age story. It's a ghost story. (Maybe.) And it's a lot of fun to watch, no maybes about that."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets remains too fun to write off just yet. Its gutsiness sets it apart from the usual survival-drama fare, and its performances suggest a deeper story even if we don't know what it is quite yet."
Yellowjackets,1,"It's a blazing start to a series speculating about the dark, seething rage and violence that lurks in young women given the agency to create and control their own society."
Yellowjackets,1,"Don't be fooled by its teen show trappings: ""Yellowjackets"" is a pitch black parable of human desperation that will creep its way under your skin given the chance."
Yellowjackets,1,"There is something incredibly bingeable about [Yellowjackets] in that the writing keeps building on itself, growing in potency as we get to know these characters better and better, courtesy of one of the best ensembles of the season."
Yellowjackets,1,It features stellar performances from the parallel casts of young actors and familiar veterans portraying characters some 25 years apart.
Yellowjackets,1,Yellowjackets generally favors the spooky over the gory with the greatest emphasis on character and relationships. It's difficult for shows to get buzz in a 500-series TV/streaming universe but Yellowjackets merits attention.
Yellowjackets,1,"Feels like a hybrid of other shows that nonetheless forms its own compelling teen/adult psychological study, with some dashes of horror and cannibalism added to the mix."
Yellowjackets,1,"At heart, ""Yellowjackets"" is a fun, pulpy twist on a midlife theme that runs back to ""Thirtysomething"" and beyond: How did I end up here?"
Yellowjackets,1,"In this compelling new series, a group of teenage girls stranded in the wilderness resort to behavior that makes the kids from ""Lord of the Flies"" seem like Cub Scouts."
Yellowjackets,1,"Yellowjackets sets up a fascinating mystery that feels inspired by the rawest parts of Alive, The Lord of the Flies, and Lost, which are now stitched together into this gory potboiler."
Yellowjackets,1,"It honestly feels like nothing else on television right now, and though its pace is somewhat more glacial than its trailers might have initially indicated, there are moments where the tension is nigh unbearable."
Yellowjackets,1,"There may be some disappointment on the horizon, but for now, Yellowjackets is about as addictive as television thrillers get."
Yellowjackets,1,"Many of its influences already overlap, and thus work together well. The ones that don't can at times combine to create something that feels new and potent, but at others make it feel like the stew could have done with fewer ingredients."
Yellowjackets,1,"When it commits to its chilling suspense, the show is utterly fascinating to watch... Let's just hope the payoff, and the inevitable reveals to come, are worth the slow-burning effort."
Yellowjackets,1,"The survival timeline is pure horror, all steadily increasing dread and glimpses of grotesque violence. The writers seed the story with hints of the supernatural, but wisely keep it vague, at least in the 6 episodes made available for review."
1883,1,1883 tells a much grittier and more violent story that highlights the lawlessness of the wild west and the harsh realities of late-19th century life.
1883,1,"Shorn of Yellowstone’s modern day mores and unavoidable comparisons to Dallas, 1883 actually might just emerge as the stronger show."
1883,1,"""This engrossing prequel draws audiences into the origins of the Dutton family's Yellowstone Ranch, chronicling their perilous journey from Fort Worth, Texas, toward Oregon."""
1883,1,Taylor Sheridan does it again. This tale of pioneers headed west has it all.
1883,1,It is a beautifully produced ode -- complete with superstar cameos -- to grim nation building and the initial episodes are uncompromising and compelling.
1883,1,"Thanks to a compelling plot and a robust cast of characters, the dramatic Western creates an entertaining chronicle that's easy to get caught up in."
1883,1,"It's enough to say that 1883 is everything you've come to expect from Taylor Sheridan, who's playing a greatest hits compilation of arch macho melodrama on the Oregon Trail, and some of the characters have the surname Dutton."
1883,1,"Two episodes in, and I genuinely can't stop thinking about it."
1883,1,"A brilliant Yellowstone prequel that portrays an era of open spaces, constant dangers..."
1883,0,An opportunity to disrupt present-day comprehension of a transformative period in U.S. history is wasted on yet another narrative from the point of view of white settlers.
1883,1,"""1883"" hits all the right notes as an absorbing piece of fiction."
1883,1,"Strap down your Stetson, 'cause it's a grim, bumpy ride... This isn't just the Duttons' traumatic origin story; in many ways, it's the American West's, too."
1883,1,"We're concerned about the pacing of 1883 and how it depicts Indigenous people, but the story is compelling, and Sam Elliott's multi-layered lead performance is more than enough to keep us interested."
1883,0,"For fans of westerns, 1883 certainly looks like the real deal, coming from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and featuring Sam Elliott as a gnarled cowboy. The execution, however, feels stale."
1883,1,"Capitalizing on the strength of the Dutton women by focusing the story on Elsa Dutton offers a uniquely fresh, female perspective."
1883,1,"Even for viewers who have yet to delve into ""Yellowstone,"" the tension and intensity is compelling."
1883,1,"1883 has the characters, the scope, and the vision to become an exciting new chapter of the Yellowstone franchise, as well as a rare example of a spin-off that never feels beholden to its source material."
1883,1,Taylor Sheridan's prequel series offers an unflinching look at the beginnings of Yellowstone's Dutton family.
1883,1,"Despite a clunky voiceover, ""1883"" feels like another durable, dependable show about broncos, cattlemen, and drovers trying to find their slice of the American dream and make their way in the world."
1883,0,I can't emphasize enough how much unearned credibility the series gets from Elliott's performance.
1883,1,"1883 has that purplish, macho Taylor Sheridan dialogue that's harsh and aphoristic at the same time. No one else writes dialogue like him."
1883,1,"The cast is certainly fully committed, and Sam Elliott was born for this sort of drama."
1883,1,A terrific expansion of Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone saga.
1883,1,"If they don't mind the Stetson-wearing testosterone, then it's a wagon trail that will prove entertaining enough to follow."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,A stalwart example of allegory's power to inform and inspire instead of merely offering escape.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"Great characters, detailed fantasy worldbuilding, serious themes and a deep respect for the Asian cultures that inspired it make Avatar a must-watch."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"[In season 3,] Aang holds to his principles. That is heroic."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"[Season 3] doesn't skimp on the action, even as it excels at philosophizing."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"After ramping the story up and drawing it back down so many times, Avatar: The Last Airbender manages to end its story with [hitting] all of the right notes."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,I couldn't possibly fathom how perfect each character would pan out. Everyone had a voice; every creature had a purpose and meaning... This story moved and kept us moving right along with it from beginning to end.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,1,"""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is not only the best animated series of the last decade, but one of the best shows ever produced."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"Odd choices abound...yet what does hold it together are the performances from Ejiofor and Naomie Harris, as Faraday’s reluctant accomplice, which succeed in creating an emotional gravitational pull."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"If you can get past its shaky start, this space oddity becomes an enjoyable exploration of humanity."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The Man Who Fell To Earth has a lot to say about everything from technology and science to faith, social media, and more. This is a dramatic tale that will make you laugh as much as it will make you think about the world around you."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"An astounding exercise of science fiction that expands upon and actualizes the original opus though sacrificing, sometimes too much, form over function… [Full review in Spanish]"
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,The cast hands in performances that does every one of them proud. But the whole package doesn’t land. There’s something too busy and slippery getting between the show and what it wants to say.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"An unmistakable urgency pushes The Man Who Fell to Earth — not just in Faraday’s mission and his belief in the ends justifying the means, but the environmental criticism guiding his journey and ours."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"It’s a tough act to follow for Chiwetel Ejiofor, a formidable actor without a doubt, who is more than up to the challenge. Ejiofor also succeeds in bringing the real allure to a story both simple and archaic."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The Man Who Fell to Earth, with out of this world turns from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Naomi Harris, Jimmy Simpson, Bill Nye and the legendary Clarke Peters, is a ""Moonage Daydream."""
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The Man Who Fell To Earth lightens its heavy conceit just enough to make the series accessible to people who aren’t necessarily sci fi fans, and Ejiofor’s performance is a big part of that."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"[Chiwetel Ejiofor's Faraday is] an incredible performance bursting with tenderness, humor and the requisite level of oddity one would expect of a being thrust into an unfamiliar place."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The original novel is quite a serious work and builds to an extraordinarily bleak and cynical ending. While one supposes this adaptation will head in the same direction, it seems intent on having a lot of fun on the way, which is perhaps just as well."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"Executes this classic science fiction storyline with a clear, fresh vision."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"Deliberately paced and full of beautiful moments of raw humanity, like Faraday, the series never hides what it is. And it’s that honesty that makes it so relatable."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"Ejiofor’s Farraday represents the show’s most purposeful and successful deviation from the one at the heart of Walter Tevis’ novel and Nicolas Roeg’s adaptation, not least because there’s no one who can exactly echo Bowie’s ethereal footsteps."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"This version of The Man Who Fell To Earth could stand to learn something from its predecessor and rely on the strength of its cast and the story, instead of surrounding them with noisy, expensive special effects and scattershot physical comedy."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"Chiwetel Ejiofor makes an extra-interesting extraterrestrial, but Naomie Harris is the heart."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,There’s a tonal whiplash that can be perplexing. But... a delightful performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor holds the series together in ways that remain entertaining and full of potential.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"It’s a solidly made, issue-oriented sci-if road trip, nothing to blow your mind, perhaps, but not at all a waste of time."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The series fails to recognize the key to the power of its source material: its peculiarity.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"It might not be a cerebral, out-of-this-world production like the Bowie film, but the Showtime series stands on its own as a great show with something important to say. And we'd all be better for hearing its message."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,The series understands that what was science fiction five decades ago may be barreling right at us now.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"Why this, and why now?"
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"The writing sometimes takes too long to truly get things going ... but thats when the collective charisma of its cast kicks in, as they are able to fill in a great deal of the shows gaps."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"This series manages to pull off something surprisingly hard to do, perfectly mixing science fiction with humor, heart, and a level of environmentalism that’s thought-provoking yet not overbearing."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"For now, this is a promising, different take that still retains some of the drama and darkness of the source material while providing some fun and fresh new material to feel relevant as something new."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,I liked what I saw.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,1,"With a cast this strong, it’s worth seeing where this mission goes next."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,Taylor Sheridan has become the modern western storyteller. [Full review in Spanish]
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Sheridan is in his element when it comes to creating male characters with a tendency towards sudden, shocking violence. Subtlety is not his forte -- but, even so, his concerns about private prisons are likely to slide past most of the red-state viewers."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Without a compelling character at the heart of it, Mayor of Kingstown is simply a dreary march toward predictable violence."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"May get better on the long run but the ""Big Sky"" twist at the start does not bode well."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Renner's ferociously powerful performance is the best thing about The Mayor of Kingstown, a gritty, highly pedigreed, impressively photographed and well-acted series..."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"If we wanted to watch a show that's relentlessly grim, there are much better choices out there."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Unless the story improves significantly, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Mayor of Kingstown gets reelected."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Mayor of Kingstown has its problems, sure, but it also has plenty of potential to say and do meaningful things in and around a complex, relevant topic."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"This series needs something to give it a distinct appeal and I have yet to really find that in these early episodes. Because of Sheridan's track record and Renner in the lead, I will stick with Mayor of Kingstown but maybe only for a single term."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Sheridan and his writers deal so much in shades of gray and blurred lines that it becomes impossible to make out any of the larger themes.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"For now, it seems too content to wallow in a world of awful people doing awful things. And these first two episodes erect walls of toxicity from which the rest of the season could have a tough time escaping."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"A dour, flavorless combination of familiar crime-drama elements, led by Renner at his most glum."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,The bluster and the questionable choices of where to focus too often overwhelm a unique context and well-intentioned discourse.
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"This all too human drama, effectively sketches people hemmed in by family loyalties and limited choices. Proving once and for all that Taylor Sheridan remains a creative force to be reckoned with."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"All these promising performances are set against a story that so far seems uninterested in complicating the alleged heroism of its protagonists, and that would rather dive deeper into doom and gloom."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Mayor of Kingstown wants to be brutal and dark, it wants to be educational, it wants to be character driven, but no element is handled with enough care or attention."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,"Mayor of Kingstown's edgy, brutal, and delivers a few shocking twists right out of the gate."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Mostly Renner just acts tired and frustrated. The feeling is contagious.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"""Mayor of Kingstown"" appears tailor-made to be forever confused with 100 other shows like it, shackled and forgotten in its allegiance to an outdated template."
Mayor of Kingstown,1,This is the kind of show the late Sidney Lumet might have made were he more interested in small-town living.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It's hard to imagine the viewer who will want to spend much more than the pilot's first hour in Kingstown.
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"It’s not perfect, but it constantly strives to be more than it is… and as always… the effort yields its rewards."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"After four seasons, Star Trek: Discovery is in uncharted territory but represents the very best ideals that the franchise can offer."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"In short, despite certain imbalances, season 4 of 'Star Trek: Discovery' is off to a pretty good start. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"""Discovery"" has broached stories about division, war, and strife and now has finally come back to the original vision of the franchise by imbuing a sense of unity, hope, and camaraderie that helps elevate this to be the best season of the show yet."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,An unstoppable force tearing its way across the galaxy is about to meet an immovable object in the form of Michael Burnham -- and the mess that's going to leave behind will no doubt make for some interesting fallout for this season to sift through.
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"It's not easy to maintain the right balance between intimate character moments and events that span the galaxy. ""Discovery,"" however, gets it right more often than not, though there are definitely moments that swing and miss."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"Discovery has saved the universe multiple times. Can't they just, I dunno, fly around and hang out for a while?"
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"Discovery's action-packed season opener is unlikely to win over any new fans, but it's the ideal introduction to both this year's big threat and the challenges facing Burnham in the captain's chair."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"Fans might be forgiven for wondering just how many chances Discovery could possibly have to reinvent itself. But judging by Season 4's first episode, the fourth time just might be the charm."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,Star Trek: Discovery Season 4 introduces an existential new threat that tests both the mental state of its characters and the ideals they uphold.
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"From comedic buddy adventure to tragedy, the journey encompasses multiple highs and lows, new characters, new settings, and new relationships. It's a lot to take in and promises a season full of exploration, mystery, conflict, and healing."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"Discovery offers up [a premiere] that meets the high visual bar the show has set in previous years, while also lining up some new character dynamics that should prove fruitful moving forward."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"If depth of character -- other than Burnham -- is still sorely missing from Discovery, at least there's a lot of dazzle to feast on."
Star Trek: Discovery,0,"It feels like a rehash from the jump, but perhaps it will go somewhere different."
Star Trek: Discovery,1,"In Season 4, the crew of Discovery is united, whole, and providing comfort and hope both to each other, and to a world that needs that right now. Maybe that's the most radical reinvention of all."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Season 2 of Star Trek: Picard ups the action and delivers a solid Star Trek storyline.
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"At 81 years old, Patrick is as commanding as ever as Jean-Luc, perfectly portraying the character’s frailty as well as his inner and outer strength."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"Bouncing between the past and present, this polished piece of science fiction drama delivers on all levels. Throwing in some time travel elements alongside adversarial mind games, Picard continues to thrive as a genuine ensemble piece."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"I like that they're taking chances, and Picard is trying to control a chaotic group of people rather than a regimented Starfleet crew."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Star Trek: Picard is rich with mythology and features some of Patrick Stewarts best work as the legendary Jean-Luc Picard. This is great storytelling and the benchmark against which all future Star Trek series should be measured.
Star Trek: Picard,1,"Star Trek: Picard is back for its second season, hitting the ground running with immediate action, top-notch performances, and no subtlety."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"Though the cast’s lack of chemistry still weakens the characters and the dialogue leaves something to be desired, Picard’s ambitious narrative this season turns out to make it worth tuning in each week."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Its only right and proper that the Borg return to centre stage as the baddies in Picards solo show
Star Trek: Picard,1,"Star Trek: Picard is still a dangerously impressive slice of sci-fi action; one that, this time around, feels more suited to a wider audience groomed on the ‘90s success of The Next Generation, rather than just a core of admirers."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Season One may have felt different for Star Trek fans in terms of storytelling and building this new world. Rest assured season two feels more aligned with the Star Trek world were used to.
Star Trek: Picard,1,Season one of “Picard” was generally underwhelming. So far season two feels more promising now that character introductions are largely out of the way and the whole team shares a goal.
Star Trek: Picard,1,"For now, at least, Picard seems to be doing its best to hearken back to the way its title character’s stories used to be told, while blending that with this more modern approach."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"The thing about those bad first seasons of “Trek” shows? They’re always the precursor to a startling turnaround. Sometimes that uptick happens in Season 2, sometimes later. “Picard” has already made it so."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"The producers and writers seem intent on balancing the familiar tropes of Trek that fans love so while still sticking to the mission of doing something different with, and for, Patrick Stewart the actor. This is a good start in that regard."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While seeing Stewart at the helm is in some respects reward enough, the producers rely a bit too heavily on that goodwill with a season that, three hours in, feels as if it's barely gotten out of drydock."
Star Trek: Picard,1,"A warm reunion with some of the franchise’s most likeable characters, but it’s hard to get away from the fact that these are all places we’ve boldly gone before."
Star Trek: Picard,1,Picard season 2 is an instant step-up from season 1.
Star Trek: Picard,1,A vastly improved season of galaxy-hopping and a sense of a franchise reconnecting with its true self.
Star Trek: Picard,1,"Featuring a much more engaging central mystery which connects deeper to The Next Generation, Picard season 2 is  so far  a fascinating journey through time & space."
Players,1,"Overall, Players is a very good show. While I think it had some areas that could’ve worked a little better, the story connected and landed really well."
Players,1,Not since Thomas Middleditch’s Richard Hendricks has a TV nerd been this addictively despicable.
Players,1,"Calling Players a “mockumentary” might be technically accurate, but feels spiritually wrong. That might make it less laugh-out-loud funny, but it also makes it more complex."
Players,1,"Even though Players is a foreign setting to me, it is also a fun and poignant portrait of some specific types of guys."
Players,1,"You don’t have to be a gamer to enjoy Players, even though the inside references will likely give gamers a smile. It’s a classic story about the veteran being displaced by an overconfident rookie, and it’s one that’s executed well."
Players,1,"Players is a decent way to get a sense for the League of Legends community. But, in its attempt to skewer the scene with awkward humor, it becomes an awkward hybrid itself, one that never leans fully enough into either drama or jokes."
Players,1,"Players' subversion of expectations effectively peels away our surface understandings of games, gamers, and gaming culture to deliver a story that, refreshingly, does right by all three."
Players,1,If you liked American Vandal (is there anyone who didn’t?) you can rest assured that Perrault and Yacenda bring the same talent for parodying a sports doc as they did for the true crime genre.
Players,0,Players fell short of the mark for me.
Players,1,"It evokes much of the greatness of American Vandal but flips the script a bit by building toward a big tournament showdown, filled with complex comeuppances and perfect payoffs."
Players,1,There’s no need to choose between someone telling a good story and someone living that story in real time when the show finds illuminating ways to capitalize on both.
Players,1,That it sells the drama while also poking fun at the innate absurdity of esports and its attending personalities is maybe Players‘s secret weapon.
Players,1,"The series may not reach the comedic heights of its predecessor, but it takes its characters seriously, no matter how ridiculous their situation may be."
The First Lady,0,"The plaiting of the three narratives occurs almost arbitrarily, with the stories converging only in the broadest strokes."
The First Lady,0,"Unfortunately, the Showtime drama mostly serves to reinforce existing historical caricatures, and while it doesn’t exactly waste the talents of Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, it certainly misuses them."
The First Lady,1,"While it’s certainly commendable that the show shines its light on the forgotten struggles of these three notable women, it’s almost a shame that the show chose to highlight first ladies whose stories have already been so vigorously told."
The First Lady,0,"The Showtime miniseries, starring Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, manages to make life as a White House wife seem both cosmic and forgettable."
The First Lady,0,"If ""The First Lady"" gets another season itll need to find a way to create compelling narratives for all its leads and be unafraid to get into the mess that is the White House."
The First Lady,1,"Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama were very different women living in very different times, but common threads quickly emerge in this engrossing new Showtime series."
The First Lady,1,"A compelling series that grounds prominent historical figures using raw emotions and struggles, The First Lady tackles important thematic issues and shares more about life before the presidency for Michelle Obama, Betty Ford, and Eleanor Roosevelt."
The First Lady,1,"DR could be describing them all when he says of Eleanor: “Proper is not a word I would use to describe you. Singular, maybe. Formidable. Relentless. Irreplaceable.” Brava."
The First Lady,0,The First Lady is a barely thematically connected and carelessly staged summary of three fascinating figures. All of them deserved better.
The First Lady,0,"With such powerhouse actors on set, its a shame that the series is a jumbled collection of moments that barely glance upon what makes these women so special."
The First Lady,0,"The writing is often clunky, obvious and filled with Big Picture Messaging, and too many of the supporting characters are one-note caricatures."
The First Lady,1,"This could have been an ungainly, unholy mess in the wrong hands. Instead, it already feels like truly addictive appointment viewing, eye-opening, enlightening and thoroughly engrossing."
The First Lady,1,There’s a prescience to Eleanor’s fury on behalf of sick and impoverished Americans suffering through the Great Depression that feels just right in 2022.
The First Lady,0,"Despite a stacked deck of talented stars and what looks to be sizeable production budget, The First Lady is dead on arrival."
The First Lady,1,"Michelle Pfeiffers Betty Ford was my favorite performance. She seemed less burdened by the layers of wigs, prosthetic teeth or extremely thin eyebrows the others had to contend with, and was at ease in the body and clothes of the former dancer."
The First Lady,1,Their stories are compelling but it’s the cast and portrayals that draw you in and take hold.
The First Lady,0,"Once the “great woman behind the man” story line emerges as the show’s primary theme, “The First Lady” cannot help but seem hopelessly old-fashioned — and ill-timed for what already seems like a regressive moment for women in our nation."
The First Lady,0,"The capacity for drama is endless. Unfortunately, The First Lady approaches each woman’s story with the depth of an Encyclopedia Britannica entry."
The First Lady,1,"The First Lady is a soapy, self-satisfied mess, but the three actresses at its center make it worth the watch."
The First Lady,0,The emotional impact is perpetually blunted by a script that feels like a school presentation rather than compelling drama.
The First Lady,0,Each episode wastes the firepower in front of the camera by plugging its actors into flashpoints and watershed moments as opposed to filling in the open canvas with cues and hints about who they are during the quieter moments.
The First Lady,0,Historical figures work best as drama when we can suddenly relate to them. These first ladies are portrayed as so superhuman that they remain as distant as the faces on our currency.
The First Lady,1,Michelle Pfeiffer holds you in the palm of her hand as Betty Ford.
The First Lady,0,"Unfortunately, while all three actors' performances are excellent, they can't save a jumbled series that never fully comes together."
The First Lady,1,Apologies to Eleanor and Michelle — both great first ladies indeed — but Betty’s life could be a series in itself.
The First Lady,1,Give it a chance. You might be surprised how moving it can be to witness the most scrutinized woman in every administration fight tooth and nail for their causes.
The First Lady,0,"The message that these women overcame barriers is hammered home, so that their heroism is never in doubt, never challenged along the way. That’s no fun."
The First Lady,1,"There are too many good performances for us to call The First Lady a failure. It’s a mildly entertaining, lightly interesting stroll through an animated museum exhibit, but it never raises any deep questions and certainly never provides any new answers."
The First Lady,0,"A show that feels too consistently shallow, hitting highlights from the lives of its subjects instead of revealing how one incident impacted another or how these people grew or changed once they were in the public eye."
The First Lady,1,A solid cast raises the stakes in the imagined behind-the-scenes drama series The First Lady...
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
The First Lady,0,The First Lady could have been great.
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy production values and talented leads, a few episodes in The First Lady starts to show fatigue, like three highly padded made-for-TV movies spliced together."
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
The First Lady,1,"Even though I'm lukewarm about the structure of The First Lady, and wary of the depictions of some of the specific story lines, I'm also very, very enthusiastic about the lead performances."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
The First Lady,1,"The first season of this purported anthology series manages to be perfectly emblematic of the saying that goes, ""Always leave them wanting more."""
The First Lady,0,The show ultimately plays like a prestige (and repetitive) reenactment of each First Lady's Wikipedia page.
The First Lady,1,Its as if they are chapters on the many sacrifices and existential crises that occur to you when you are more defined by what happens for others than what happens to you.
The First Lady,1,"You may cheer, and you will also hope -- however lovely it looks -- that as a drama The First Lady eventually ventures deeper."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
The Stand,1,"With COVID-19 plaguing the world, The Stand takes on an eerie, postmodern creepiness it might not otherwise have."
The Stand,1,Absorbing characters and situations stand out.
The Stand,0,"There's potential for this story to resonate very strongly with audiences at this moment in history, but the decision to present it out of chronological order puts everything it has to offer at risk."
The Stand,1,"When it comes to post-apocalyptic horror, The Stand still delivers."
The Stand,0,"Somehow this isn't really what I want to watch in the throes of COVID 19, especially as it's not a great adaptation."
The Stand,0,"The Stand is a shockingly inept adaptation of Stephen King's most beloved properties. Nearly every creative choice is bad - from bland characters, to stilted dialogue, to glacial pacing. It's just so boring."
The Stand,0,"In 2021, when there's more content out there than any but the shut-in or chronically unemployed can hope to consume, being ignored - as The Stand deserves to be - is perhaps the unkindest fate of all."
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
The Stand,0,This adaptation of The Stand is content to scratch the surface of these individuals. It's an oddly revealing failure of nerve.
The Stand,1,"Stephen King's 1100-page apocalypse has unfolded in captivating style, maintaining the vibrant Stephen Kingyness of the characters and ratcheting up the tension at will -- even if all the bouncing around in time makes it feel rather choppy."
The Stand,1,"I genuinely did enjoy the first four episodes. But it's by episode five where I start to turn around, but because it's King, I still want to see these built-up characters follow through..."
The Stand,1,"The source material itself keeps it from being great. But it does keep you interested, and that is the power of King's storytelling."
The Stand,0,"With its many subplots, some more compelling than others, it's an uneven series that's not so much a must-watch as a can-watch."
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
The Stand,1,"With a cast that also includes Amber Heard, Greg Kinnear, Nat Wolff, J.K. Simmons, Heather Graham, Ezra Miller and a cameo from King himself, there's plenty of reasons to keep watching."
The Stand,1,"Amber Heard is a little iffy as Nadine Cross, and the magnificent Whoopi Goldberg needs no introduction, but Marsden's Stu Redman is an engaging and buoyant hero and Alexander Skarsgard's Randall Flagg is compelling in every way"
The Stand,1,"'The Stand' aspires to be the definitive Stephen King's adaptation, twisting the novel's narrative and capturing all its essence."
The Stand,1,"As befits King the horror maestro, there's lots of nasty business with corpses, rats and wounds, and the virus does grisly things to people's necks as they die in a spew of green froth."
The Stand,1,"[A] faithful and gripping translation of King's end-times drama about the dangerous allure of individualism (and tyrannical leaders), and the vital necessity of togetherness in times of turmoil."
The Stand,1,"The first episode of the series shows potential, but chooses a not so easy to follow way of telling the story. It may alienate those not familiar with Stephen King's work."
The Stand,0,"[The novel] captured a crisis through small stories that converged to form a larger reality. Had the show retained the novel's pacing, and opted for grief over gore, King's message of humanity's resilience might have carried more weight in these times."
The Stand,1,"It is to Marsden's credit that all he needs to do is show up and we clock him as the hero this apocalypse needs. Likewise, Owen Teague is superbly deployed as a bitter young incel named Harold Laude."
The Stand,1,"This new version of The Stand is off to an intriguing start, whether you're a fan of the book or not."
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
The Stand,1,The scattershot story didn't do a lot to pique my interest in what lies ahead.
The Stand,0,"Forging a connection with the characters carries the series to a point, but it only takes a few episodes to realize that there isn't much to build toward in the lead-up to the story's inevitable confrontation between good and evil."
The Stand,1,"If The Stand can iron out its pacing issues and find ways to depict the scope of King's novel, its rocky start, like pre-Captain Trips society, will feel like a distant memory."
The Stand,1,"As it is, The Stand has some great direction and terrific acting, even if some of the time management isn't on point. In the simplest terms: I wanted to love it (I still do) but ended up liking it."
The Stand,0,Never rises above a slightly dreary competence.
The Stand,1,"Put a Skarsgård in every King project, I say."
The Stand,0,"There are some decent moments buried in The Stand, but it's so generally mishandled on the whole that it's not worth slogging through the rest to get to them."
The Stand,1,"It's not perfect by any means, but the series does about as well as anyone might reasonably expect considering the source, and never suffers a boring minute."
The Stand,0,"I can see that this concept might have seemed mind-blowing at the time, or mind-blowing at the right time in someone's cultural coming of age, but today, it is pretty old cheese, having been worked over endlessly in the interim."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The Stand,0,"Despite a talented, A-list cast, plenty of time to develop the complex story, a seemingly hefty budget and one of King's most celebrated works as inspiration, the new ""Stand"" adaptation falls mostly flat."
The Stand,1,"It's a reasonably skilled and unobjectionable job of transcription and compression, stutter-stepping among time lines to keep track of King's manifold plot strands and characters."
The Stand,0,"This adaptation, which starts off succinctly, starts to strain as soon as it has to shoulder the biblical proportions. ""The Stand"" works better as a study in survivalist pluck than as a theological thunderdome."
The Stand,0,"For those who enjoyed the original inclined to ask, ""Why do I need this?,"" the answer is pretty well ""You don't,"" other than a promised new coda to the story written by King."
The Stand,1,"""The Stand"" provides something trickier: plague escapism. Pandemic fantasy. That it succeeds is a testament to its author, the durability of his vision and the adaptability of his imagination."
The Stand,1,"A sometimes dazzling, often frustrating, and undeniably assured effort that swings hard and occasionally connects. When it does, it's riveting television; when it doesn't, well, it's not boring."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
The Stand,1,"The spirit and dread of Mr. King's epic have been successfully, if more succinctly, incorporated into the series. The drawback of its timing? It might distract us from how timeless a piece of fiction can really be."
The Stand,1,"What keeps even the messiest and murkiest sections of The Stand gripping are the performances, specifically from Teague and Young."
The Stand,0,"I'll watch the last three episodes, especially to see the new coda written by King himself, but too much of this new attempt to tackle The Stand is full of coughing and mucous, signifying nothing."
The Stand,0,"This new version has its inspired moments, like the way Billy Joel's ""The Stranger"" somehow turns out to be the perfect theme song for Flagg, but the structure keeps sucking the life out of things, from major characters to more minor ones."
The Stand,1,"The standout performance is absolutely Owen Teague... whose incel/school-shooter vibes and frenzied, unrequited crush on Frannie make him immediately repellent-he's also so realistic, he's even scarier than Flagg at times."
The Stand,1,"It's effective TV horror, it's a recognizable dystopia story, but almost nothing hits as hard as it could."
The Stand,0,"It's curiously bland, devoid of most of the scares that King is known for, and telling a straightforward story in a faithful but lifeless manner."
The Stand,1,"The Stand is a story about humanity that happens to have a pandemic running through it and, as is the case with actual humanity, it's the little imperfections that make it so relatable, so admirable, and ultimately beautiful."
The Stand,1,"For the most part, it's time well spent."
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
The Stand,0,"That conflicted quality makes the danger faced by the community serving as humanity's last stand curiously subdued, and ""The Stand"" struggles to distinguish itself outside of its exceptional casting choices."
The Stand,1,"""The Stand"" is at its best when it isn't afraid to be, well, ""The Stand."" Its unvarnished fantasy is its greatest strength, but that also leads to its greatest weakness."
The Stand,1,Certainly an improvement over the original mini-series from a technical standpoint even if it doesn't quite come together as well as it could have.
The Stand,1,"Whether or not the adaptation will remain compelling to the end remains to be seen, but it has all the elements to pull it off, including a respect for the material that isn't afraid to streamline when necessary."
The Stand,1,"The Stand is a Christmas gift for Constant Readers, and while they won't get to see every page unfold on screen, they get to spend the holidays with some of their favorite characters finally brought to life."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"The show is kind of like a dark buddy comedy à la Weekend at Bernie's or Midnight Run: Our heroes are goofy, the straits are dire, we don't know how they're gonna pull it off, but damn do we want them to."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"It's a charmingly self-aware series that goes on a little too long, but it does a remarkable job of poking fun at the true crime genre while also presenting a legitimately interesting mystery."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"""For Heaven's Sake"" becomes a valuable addition to local history and a valiant effort to follow through on generations of almost-mythic curiosity."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"So maybe it's spoiler-y to say that For Heaven's Sake becomes a different show as it goes along. But since the show it becomes is a good one, I don't think anybody will care."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"Because the filmmakers who made For Heaven's Sake don't take themselves seriously, they make the already-interesting story of Harold Heaven even more entertaining."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"What starts out as a mocumentary morphs into an honest and true documentary investigating a cold case file from Haliburton, Ontario."
For Heaven's Sake,1,"As true-crime, it's an intriguing cottage-country mystery. As offbeat comedy, it's loopy and charming."
For Heaven's Sake,1,Among the various virtues of For Heaven's Sake is the charming ineptitude of the show's principal characters.
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
Twin Peaks,1,Twin Peaks is back and somehow as strange and beautiful as ever.
Twin Peaks,1,"Even as you begin to grasp its contours and try to assemble the puzzle, you will still be left with pieces that don't quite fit together. Maybe they don't fit because you're solving a jigsaw when Lynch has designed a four-dimensional polyhedron."
Twin Peaks,1,"This is not the story of a sleepy Northwestern town full of quirky characters. This is the unfiltered product of Lynch's TM practice, a direct line into the subconscious mind of one of America's great film directors."
Twin Peaks,1,"If the series continues like this, it is likely to be remembered as another memorable piece of Lynch's filmography, at the level of his most popular films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Twin Peaks,1,"I don't know where [David] Lynch and [Mark] Frost are taking us but I'm happy to embark on this journey into what Agent Rosenfield calls the ""absurd mysteries of the strange forces of existence""."
Twin Peaks,1,"An anxiety consumes you as you watch The Return, a wildness of connections-like some radio telescope scanning the universe for signals."
Twin Peaks,1,More intellectually and emotionally stimulating than anything I've seen in a long time.
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: The Return was ghastly, comic, romantic, mysterious, and unlike anything ever to come before it. It was some damn fine coffee."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks is a peculiar kind of game, one almost intended for online channels-a game that we play in order to figure out its rules."
Twin Peaks,1,"Not only did Lynch complete the story he began over almost 30 years ago, he also completely rewrote it-and in effect rewrote the medium of television itself."
Twin Peaks,1,The reason I love it is probably the reason why some people couldn't get through it...
Twin Peaks,1,"As we dive into David Lynch and Mark Frost's reboot of the iconic series, it is both thrilling and confounding to be submerged in a mystery that's languished for 25 years, one that many have spent decades pursuing."
Twin Peaks,1,"It may not be the AARP-approved idea of the state of being old, but that doesn't make Lynch and Frost's efforts here any less poignant."
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
Twin Peaks,1,"There are times, in all four of these opening hours, when this new show feels so right, so dreamlike, so ... so very Twin Peaks."
Twin Peaks,1,Twin Peaks foregrounds a kind of American emptiness of the soul that is filled by violence.
Twin Peaks,1,It is simultaneously heartbreaking and absolute entertainment gold.
Twin Peaks,1,It contained multitudes...and Michael Cera doing a Marlon Brando impression. It was pure televisual maximalism.
Twin Peaks,1,When watching everything just... fits.
Twin Peaks,1,"The new series was exactly as we should have expected -- not like the original or the follow-up as fans had speculated but a continuation of the two, although still absolutely modern and unique."
Twin Peaks,1,"I have no idea what I just witnessed. I don't mean to be cute; I don't know exactly what to say about an intrinsically weird series that returned twenty-five years later, as esoteric as ever."
Twin Peaks,1,David Lynch's cult-classic revival is exactly as imaginative-and as uncomfortable-as it always needed to be.
Twin Peaks,1,"Those wanting answers, or in the very least closure, might understandably feel a little adrift right now, but it can't be denied that Peaks came back as a true artistic force that challenged just about every storytelling convention we know."
Twin Peaks,1,"That's what Twin Peaks might be, after it's all said and done. Not a detective caper, or gumshoe sendup, not a celebration of American tropes from diners to police stations, but strictly Dada."
Twin Peaks,1,"It stopped feeling like a TV show to me, at some point, and started feeling like a gift."
Twin Peaks,1,As wayyy out there as Twin Peaks can get -- and it zoomed even farther beyond the outer limits than I thought it would this season -- watching it can still be remarkably personal.
Twin Peaks,1,What we just witnessed was unmatched in the medium's history.
Twin Peaks,1,"[David lynch] has burst out of the glass box of kitschy remembrance. . .giving us the brilliant, the slick, the sick; the weird, of course, but the deeply human that made Twin Peaks so special all those years ago."
Twin Peaks,1,"The Return isn't a true follow-up to Twin Peaks. It's something bigger, stranger, and far more interesting."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: Return feels like hard work, like taking a three hundred level abstract art class when you have a load of 21 credits. The show makes my mind hurt! Yet, I find that I can't take my eyes off the screen when it's on."
Twin Peaks,1,"[Lynch is] in experimental filmmaker mode and he doesn't care if he's liked or not or who's coming with him. Everyone wanted the nostalgia thing, and it's not that. Now every character has many doppelgangers, and every character is in every dimension."
Twin Peaks,0,"I'm a fan of TV that breaks the rules. But for me, there are minimum requirements for coherence. And Twin Peaks is self-indulgently messing with viewers."
Twin Peaks,1,I love Twin Peaks because it represents David Lynch at his most gleefully ornery. The man can do whatever he likes. I'm in deep.
Twin Peaks,1,"When a multimedia phenomenon comes as heavily coded as this, the onus is on the viewer to piece together all its oddball fragments and episodic epiphanies into a coherent whole, as if such deciphering might lead to... a grand theory of everything."
Twin Peaks,1,"It does make me think about what sort of person I am, and how I want to respond to the unsteady ground around me."
Twin Peaks,1,"The Twin Peaks revival is perfect. I'm in deep with it. It's easily the best series of the year so far. And, although this might seem like heresy to long-time fans, I think it might actually be better than the original."
Twin Peaks,1,"Four episodes in, it's already delivering a recognizably addictive mix of the macabre, the quotidian, the folksy, the soapy, the sick, the surreal, and the downright weird. It may be even better than 1990's revelatory first season."
Twin Peaks,1,"This is an altogether shiftier beast, haunting and beautiful when it wants to be; ugly and aggressively off-putting when it doesn't."
Twin Peaks,1,"This is an entertaining and intriguing return to form that will delight fans and maybe-just maybe-pull in a new audience happy to overlook the slow pace and random non sequiturs in return for a glimpse into Lynch's inimitable, magical, dystopian world."
Twin Peaks,1,"Above all, the new Twin Peaks is gloriously trippy."
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
Twin Peaks,1,"Yes, I think Mr Lynch may have done it again. Just call me a Peaks freak, but I think I know what's going on, or will in about 25 years; for the moment, jes' enjoying the ride, ma'am, and hugely."
Twin Peaks,1,This doesn't feel like the Twin Peaks we know and love and that's because it's not.
Twin Peaks,1,It's a credit to Lynch that he has not adapted his style to suit TV's more muted sensibilities (even in this Golden Age) but remained true to what he does best.
Twin Peaks,1,It's a rollercoaster of a lucid dream. I can't wait to see more.
Twin Peaks,1,"So far Twin Peaks: The Return is jarring, disturbing, frustrating, fascinating, a little bit funny, and a lot weird. I hope we get to spend more time in Twin Peaks soon, but I'm in it for the full run."
Twin Peaks,1,The Twin Peaks reboot is not the fusion of arthouse and mainstream sensibilities that viewers might expect. It's pure David Lynch -- and it's glorious.
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks has become the show from another place, the darkness of future past, a geist that had to travel in time to find its zeit."
Twin Peaks,1,"What seems clear is that Twin Peaks: The Return will rank as one of TV's most epic indulgences, so infatuated with its own fascinating and at times narcotizing weirdness that its value to the viewer will depend on their eagerness to ride along."
Twin Peaks,1,"90s cult fave reboot just as odd, arresting as the original."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: The Return jettisons the outdated premise of the white suburbs as a bastion of innocence. In fact, it leaves behind the series' namesake town for the bulk of the action -- and is much more compelling for it."
Twin Peaks,1,Twin Peaks remains the nightmare fuel it always has been.
Twin Peaks,1,Confounding but still vintage Lynch.
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Twin Peaks,1,"Depending on your familiarity with David Lynch's body of work and your opinion of which, Twin Peaks' near-complete diversion from small town soap to full-fledged science-fiction horror will either come as a shock or natural progression."
Twin Peaks,1,"This is next-level, full-tilt, mind-f**k TV."
Twin Peaks,0,"Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's ""Lynchian."" But there's a lot more weirdness on TV than there was in 1990."
Twin Peaks,1,"From the first twang of Angelo Badalamenti's haunting theme music, it was as if Lynch was determined to remind all those shows indebted to Twin Peaks -- True Detective and Fargo, for example -- that no one does weird quite like him."
Twin Peaks,1,"You don't go to Lynch for coherence anyway. You watch his work because you want to experience his open-air id, his uncorked subconscious, working through a dream-logic that requires a viewer to let go and groove on whatever Lynch throws at you."
Twin Peaks,1,"What premiered on Sunday was as accessibly scary, disturbing and audaciously funny as many of the best parts of the original Twin Peaks, and nowhere near as hallucinatory and subtextually distilled as the prequel film Fire Walk With Me."
Twin Peaks,1,"It is deliberately, punishingly tedious -- but that's why Twin Peaks is so beguiling."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks: The Return was creepy, surreal, bizarre, and often unintelligible. Just like its predecessor."
Twin Peaks,1,"Yes, the new Twin Peaks is weird, and feels like Lynch more unfiltered than ever, but it also very definitely has a narrative"
Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot."
Twin Peaks,1,"It's amazing it was made at the time, and exciting to have it back now. May it make us all a little crazy."
Twin Peaks,1,"As the return of Twin Peaks surges on after a promising but troubled start, I have to credit it with this: It's the rare screen entertainment that allows us to contemplate faces that have aged in real time."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks feels like the story of two Dale Coopers: one on the inside, one on the outside, all shrouded in a curtain of creepiness, theatrically, stilted acting and unnerving moments sandwiched in between."
Twin Peaks,1,"Very little of this re-entry into ""Twin Peaks"" makes any sense. Yet it's admirable that the drama's creators have found a way to update the universe without relinquishing its signature atmosphere."
Twin Peaks,1,It may the more grounded plot strand that speaks loudest both to newcomers to the acid trip known as Twin Peaks - and to me.
Twin Peaks,1,"Things may be a little different but, twenty-five years later, Twin Peaks is still a place I want to be."
Twin Peaks,1,"What does it all mean? Hell if I know. But that's the fundamental joy of Twin Peaks: The Return, whose odd tonal shifts, scarily schizoid imagery, and mind-boggling train-of-thought digressions are unadulterated Lynch."
Twin Peaks,1,One question hanging over the revival was: would Twin Peaks still seem special now that so many shows have been born in its image? There are echoes of The Bridge and Stranger Things. But these are not so much borrowings as I'll-have-that-backs
Twin Peaks,1,"Twenty-six years after the original left the air, Lynch is still more than capable of confounding and unsettling us."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks obsessives have been waiting for the box to come to life with Agent Cooper once again inside, and while we got our wish, we also got everything that comes along with the package deal that is David Lynch's surrealistic filmmaking."
Twin Peaks,1,"This revival is fascinating, delirious and definitively, unmistakably Lynchian, but somewhere in the intervening years the state of mind that defined the original has been lost."
Twin Peaks,1,The return of Twin Peaks would bewilder anyone unfamiliar with the show. But the visuals were still arresting.
Twin Peaks,1,"As much as season 3 shows the advancement of Lynch's style, it still remains true to its traditions."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks must be treated now as it was then: a slow moving painting, detailed almost in real time, as the artist applies stroke after stroke to the canvas, a layered pile of movement, music and cryptic spoken words."
Twin Peaks,1,"This is a completely new Twin Peaks, a show both aware of its cultural impact and its importance to fans, but also something that has completely evolved to embrace all the things that have changed in its world since it last aired."
Twin Peaks,1,"The two-hour season premiere somehow managed to feel both familiar and strange, putting friendly faces in frightening new contexts, at once sweetly nostalgic and starkly sinister. It's a hell of a thing."
Twin Peaks,1,"Lynch and Frost didn't bring back Twin Peaks to merely please themselves or flaunt their oddities. They brought it back as a piece of pure Sunday-night entertainment, and that may be the most surprising thing about it."
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Twin Peaks,1,"Suffice it to say that if, by the end of these re-introductory two hours, you can follow what is happening, then you haven't been paying attention."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks was always about how it feels. And as funny and as shocking as this opener was, what we are really left with is sadness, much of it stemming from time itself -- past lives, present realities, age, death."
Twin Peaks,1,"Beyond the cast, the show was beautifully shot by Peter Deming, and Angelo Badalamenti's score is as iconic as ever. The pieces of this puzzle inspire rapture. But when you try to assemble them, what kind of picture do you create?"
Twin Peaks,1,"The first two hours should, at least, pique any fan's curiosity. And for a program that never fit in a neat little box, Lynch and company have seemingly found the right time and place to reappear."
Twin Peaks,1,"Lynch likes to take his time and let the camera linger over waterfalls, red curtains and other elements of place that made the original series such a weird and wonderful ride."
Twin Peaks,1,"Mr. Lynch's mastery of tension persists. The script, by him and Mr. Frost, recognizes the power of silence and anticipation. And Mr. Lynch, who is directing the entire revival, still has his penchant for dualities and eerie beauty."
Twin Peaks,1,"Twin Peaks defies ultimate analysis, and ultimate judgment. That's its secret and mystique, and why it's back after 25 years, as a reminder that TV -- like art -- doesn't have to be reduced to nuts and bolts, or to specific meaning either."
Twin Peaks,1,"For fans who have loved the show's surreal, subversive spirit, Lynch has supercharged every element that made the original series a TV classic."
Twin Peaks,1,"It's bleak, uncompromising, and laced with the rumbling sense of dread and unease that makes Lynch such a formidable filmmaker."
Twin Peaks,1,What a good show this is. Who cares who killed who?
Twin Peaks,1,"Two hours of sumptuously photographed, obtuse, patience-taxing, and sometimes demonically horrifying imagery that I'll bet single-handedly destroyed the nostalgic goodwill that had accrued since the show was announced."
Twin Peaks,0,"The show, which derived its power from the aftermath of trauma in a small community, has chosen to tell a story that's odder and bigger -- so big, in fact, that it has so far choked off what made Twin Peaks work all along."
Twin Peaks,1,"I loved every plodding, baffling minute of it."
Twin Peaks,1,Lynch's vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn't be otherwise acceptable .
Twin Peaks,1,"We have returned to Twin Peaks at last, and it is a weirder place than ever."
Why Women Kill,1,"It’s an almost cartoonish dark farce led by a sensational cast. Tolman, whose entire demeanour changes incrementally throughout the series, is totally compelling."
Why Women Kill,1,"Tolman and Frost are delightful together, and Parilla is suitably evil in a drop-dead glamorous way."
Why Women Kill,0,"The ensuing lurid shenanigans are cartoonish to a campy extreme, and it's hard to care who'll end up killing whom in their venal, petty squabbles."
Why Women Kill,1,"[Tolman is] perfectly cast as Alma, who will experience an awakening that will set her on a course, as the voiceover says at the beginning of the hour, from inconsequential to infamous."
Why Women Kill,1,"A frump becoming a society diva just seems like a thin storyline... Fortunately, Cherry once again knows how to cast his female leads. If there's anyone we'd want to watch blossom over the course of a season, it's the effervescent Tolman."
Why Women Kill,1,"There's so much beauty in every frame, from the costumes to the production design - and actors able to rise to the occasion - that it's easy to ignore that the series isn't necessarily stretching itself."
Why Women Kill,1,"Surpasses the first season by concentrating on one story and one set of interconnected characters, boosted by an excellent cast."
The Legend of Korra,1,"Much of the frustration with Legend of Korra is warranted, particularly around the political narratives it's endorsing. At the same time, Korra denies us the easy solutions that leave us feeling cozy after watching Avatar."
The Legend of Korra,1,"The martial-arts action segments are unparalleled (like an animated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), but Korra's status as one of the great feminist cartoon heroines secures her place on this list."
The Legend of Korra,1,"[Kuvira] is a fearsome beauty, possessing a strength and determination that could rival Amon, or even Zaheer. While her motivations for this new world order are still unclear, she should be an interesting addition to this season"
The Legend of Korra,1,"I loved this show by the end, and I can't tell you how happy it made me to see such a strong lineup of female characters, led by the strongest who was a woman of color."
The Legend of Korra,1,Korra's growth from brash and impatient teenager to capable leader and mature woman is incredibly satisfying; Korra managed to be one of the best series about a female superhero since Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
The Legend of Korra,1,In a cultural climate that is starving for strong female representation... -- The Legend Of Korra has consistently delivered captivating female figures.
The Legend of Korra,1,[In this season]... nearly every core character had a role in taking the colossus down.
The Legend of Korra,1,"I appreciate Book 4 [for] putting one of its central conflicts front and center from the start, and delineating the two sides very clearly."
The Legend of Korra,1,"While some characters were underutilized and several episodes dragged, the overarching story was solid, specifically in terms of theme and allegory."
The Legend of Korra,1,[Book Four] eases us back to life with old friends. Knowing that the core characters' emotional lives continued forward is the real joy.
Teen Wolf,1,"With a story arc focusing on memory loss and the importance one person can having in your life, it's bound to be both inspiring and heartbreaking."
Teen Wolf,0,"While Stiles is missed in the last batch of episodes, this fun MTV show finds a nice way to say goodbye."
Teen Wolf,1,"Still, Teen Wolf was original and ambitious in its overarching narratives, and it was admired for its attempts to break new ground in a genre that is now well beyond the point of saturation."
Teen Wolf,1,I'm a fan of a story that isn't tied up too neatly into a nice bow. Open ends mean the potential for a reunion movie down the line.
Teen Wolf,1,"You know, if you ignore all the problems with these final ten episodes - the lack of repercussions and overall pacing - then the finale is pretty good."
Teen Wolf,1,"It was both an ending and a new beginning, as the best series finales usually are, and it was beautiful."
Teen Wolf,1,"I really enjoyed Derek and Stiles' conflicting accounts of their South American adventures. I wish we'd gotten to see more from those two, but I understand there was a lot to squeeze into this episode."
Teen Wolf,0,"This finale felt like more of a cliffhanger than anything the show has done before, which is a strange choice when writing the series finale. I don't love knowing that there's a huge war to be fought and that's where all these people are going."
Teen Wolf,1,Almost everyone fans were hoping to see by series finale time have come home.
Teen Wolf,1,It was a fun bit for the writers to make this revelation in the final season of the show.
Teen Wolf,1,"A promising enough start to the the last season of the series, it hasn't done anything yet to help us forgive it's missteps, but it's a foot in the right direction."
Teen Wolf,1,"Teen Wolf has earned the right to play with some daring stories and tricky emotions, and it does just that in an assured, streamlined final season."
The Twilight Zone,0,"As with most anthology series, the results are decidedly mixed. For one thing, the show does away with its social justice bent entirely at a time in which those stories would be most welcome."
The Twilight Zone,0,"Ultimately, this Twilight Zone suffers by comparison, because there is just so much to compare it with - Serling's still peerless original, Jordan Peele's movies, other sci-fi anthology series such as Black Mirror and now TZ's own first season."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Season 2 is satisfyingly spooky and twisted, with a wry sense of humor."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Season two takes a more nuanced approach to its examinations of the fragile dude ego, and the end results are more chilling."
The Twilight Zone,0,"[If] these episodes are to be taken as an indicator of the whole, The Twilight Zone season 2 is not worth a visit. [...] While we keep hoping for a brighter future for The Twilight Zone, it seems to be stuck in the past."
The Twilight Zone,1,The Twilight Zone's second season is not quite as dramatic a makeover as needed. But it offers a more successful collection of stories overall and is indeed a noticeable improvement on the first.
The Twilight Zone,1,"It's an encouraging sign that The Twilight Zone's second season begins with an episode that's relatively simple, and highly watchable."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Still a decent reboot, but far too timid."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Judging from the handful of overlong episodes made available ahead of launch, the new Zone is still rather a mixed bag, though one brimming with imaginative pleasures and smart casting."
The Twilight Zone,1,"If the rest of Season 2 is as bold and original as its first three episodes, it's well on its path to eclipsing that uneven first season and potentially becoming a must-watch series of television."
The Twilight Zone,1,Another weirdly entertaining set of stories in the tradition of its original predecessor.
The Twilight Zone,1,"An incremental improvement over the revival's mixed first season, with the binge model proving the perfect delivery system for these bite-sized stories."
The Twilight Zone,1,"It's weird to live in a world where The Twilight Zone can impede on Black Mirror's territory, but here we are."
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
The Twilight Zone,1,"These episodes feel stronger written than Season 1, and if the editing tightens up like it did before, these new entries could be amazing. It'll be hard for any other episode to be better than ""You Might Also Like,"" though, which is a pure masterpiece."
The Twilight Zone,0,"In a twist worthy of the show's creepy music, the original series speaks to the strange times through which we're living more directly and profoundly than the new one."
The Twilight Zone,1,"With the writing tighter and more focused, the show makes up for a lot of the previous season's shortcomings."
The Twilight Zone,0,"There's also a lot of potential for season two to reach the same highs that episodes like last season's ""Replay"" delivered. For now, though, season two is off to a mixed start."
The Twilight Zone,0,It's a tough look that the new season's three episodes screened for critics in advance was also its safest and most conventional.
The Twilight Zone,1,"These episodes certainly feel more strongly written than Season 1, and if the editing tightens up like it did before, these new entries could be amazing."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Twilight Zone is at its best when it takes full advantage of the opportunity to embrace both its as well as the franchise's legacy of, well, making things weird. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen quite often enough."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
The Twilight Zone,0,"The second season of the science-fiction anthology series continues to suffer from what I call the John Carter Jinx - an affliction that affects properties that have inspired countless imitators, but in the process been overtaken by them."
The Twilight Zone,1,"But better is a relative term, and it's important to note even the cleverest and most socially relevant stuff still can't hold a candle to the lofty heights achieved by the very best of the original show."
iCarly,1,"The combination of adult humor with the corniness and energy of these characters is not easy, yet iCarly nails it every time."
iCarly,1,"In a world of How I Met Your Fathers and Dexter: New Bloods, iCarly continues to be proof that it’s actually possible to do a good job bringing a show back."
iCarly,1,"One of the better revivals out there, thanks to a mix of genuine chemistry among its cast and sharp writing that addresses modern-day issues."
The Good Wife,1,"Over its seven seasons, ""The Good Wife"" has taken a character seen in American culture mostly as a victim, the betrayed political wife, and given her real agency."
The Good Wife,1,"The Good Wife ended spectacularly in personal terms after a superb, seven-year run."
The Good Wife,0,"""End"" had moments that worked but never came together on the whole."
The Good Wife,1,"It's not an empowering ending of Alicia truly striking out of her own, but a tragically dark one that makes sense all the same."
The Good Wife,1,"The [slap] scene made a striking conclusion to a series that has been not just a legal procedural and a political drama and a subtle meditation on marriage, but also a study of female friendship. It was also a fittingly cynical one."
The Good Wife,1,"Ok, so this wasn't the conclusion the world had been waiting for, but the absence of The Good Wife is going to leave a gaping hole that, I would hazard, will be impossible to fill. Great characters, strong stories, always ingenious writing."
The Good Wife,1,"[The Good Wife] t was glimmeringly smart.The intricacies of both the law and politics played out like an exquisitely choreographed mating ritual among influential people with money, intellect, ambition and superior grooming."
The Good Wife,1,"I expected more from the show than a red cheeked Alicia going off in search of her man. But I'll miss the series, and I doubt there will ever be a network drama like it."
The Good Wife,1,"I doubt that this finale will be beloved, either, because it didn't reward the characters. But for me it was an ending that commanded respect."
The Good Wife,1,"Of course The Good Wife had ups and downs over seven years, but overall it was the rare broadcast drama that held its own against cable's ""prestige"" offerings."
The Good Wife,1,"At times The Good Wife was a great show. Other times it was a frustrating one. But, it was rarely boring."
The Good Wife,1,It is a ballsy series finale that leaves its audience with a literal slap to the face
The Good Wife,0,"Yes, Alicia strides out of the hallway composing herself, but the character and the show, feel a bit in tatters, kind of a let down from the promise the show has always had and a far cry from the greatness it was able to achieve."
The Good Wife,1,"The Good Wife's certainly left something to be desired in terms of full conclusions, but the finale was right in line with how our best TV shows end in this Golden Age."
The Good Wife,1,"The Good Wife always did a nice job of holding onto -- a super-realist take on the world through the eyes of lawyers. The finale didn't lie to us, didn't try to paint Alicia as anything other than striving, however you choose to interpret that word."
The Good Wife,1,The Good Wife ended emphatically Sunday. There could be no doubt of that.
The Good Wife,0,"The finale was littered with non-conclusions, contradictions and plain old absurdities."
The Good Wife,1,I'm so disappointed in this series finale.
The Good Wife,0,"The main thing is that we've finally put this show out of its misery, so it can't stray any further from the brilliant, decisive characters it originated. And hey. That's better than nothing."
The Good Wife,1,This Alicia isn't the Alicia we saw seven series ago; she's become tough and hard-shelled; she's a brilliant lawyer and a dirty fighter. And this exit will surprise everyone.
The Good Wife,1,"In the end, Alicia was just Alicia - a brilliant, flawed and complex woman we have loved watching for seven years."
The Good Wife,1,"One of the most muscularly plotted, flawlessly performed, and thematically risk-taking network dramas of all time."
The Good Wife,1,"The series of the great scripts, the aesthetic elegance and the secondary ones of luxury. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Good Wife,1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the season premiere, in part because I was able to check my expectations."
The Good Wife,1,Perhaps it was appropriate that we ended the series with Peter emphatically denying that he buried evidence and those advising Alicia saying that he probably did.
The Good Wife,1,One of the great things about the finale is that it ends smack in the middle of everything.
The Good Wife,1,"Now armed with cool intelligence, a weathered savvy, and the kind of controlled ruthlessness that the past six years have built in her, Alicia is an even more interesting underdog than before."
The Good Wife,1,"It was redeemed, as happened so often in the show's run, by Ms. Margulies's fierce intensity as Alicia."
The Good Wife,1,The show regained some sense of purpose once it was clear that this season would be its last and the Kings could start writing in earnest towards their planned ending.
The Good Wife,1,"She's come a long way since she wore an Alice-band and towed the line of the goody-two-shoes wife. With Eli knowing where all the dead bodies are, this series will be Machiavellian with a capital M."
The Good Wife,1,It's the end of the last truly adult drama on commercial network television.
The Good Wife,1,"Because of economics and viewer demographics, there may never be a show like The Good Wife again."
The Good Wife,1,"One of the ways The Good Wife digs into corporate culture is with clever and insightful perspective-switching, and this is no exception."
The Good Wife,1,Seeing Alan Cumming getting side-swiped by Margo Martindale and then vowing revenge is worth an entire season of most other dramas.
The Good Wife,1,"Funny, smart and more serialized than most CBS dramas, the series remains a minor miracle in this balkanized age, straddling the line between ambitious cable fare and network series that, at least this fall, look determined to party like it's 1995."
The Good Wife,1,"As TV critics and surely your parents have told you, The Good Wife is an underappreciated show, in its own class on network television."
The Good Wife,1,"We blur the edges every now and then, but our core self is both complicated and contradictory, lovely and ugly. There isn't a series that shines a light on those realities brighter than this one."
The Good Wife,1,"Here, late in its life (season 7!), showrunners Robert and Michelle King Michael and their cast, led by an unfailingly dialed-in Julianna Margulies, refuses to settle for auto-pilot zombiehood."
The Good Wife,1,The show remains the best drama on broadcast television.
The Good Wife,1,I guess it's officially time to start thinking of The Good Wife as The Alicia Florrick Show.
The Good Wife,1,"It will be good to see her actually struggling now, as she was starting to get a little boring."
The Good Wife,1,"Certainly ""Bond"" was a very solid episode of The Good Wife, and it had a number of interesting paths to follow with Alicia and Eli's respective reboots."
The Good Wife,1,"From the looks of this premiere, I think this season of The Good Wife Season 7 may be the best one yet."
The Good Wife,1,"I do like the way Good Wife writers poke about the darker corners of law in the search for stories. I also very much like the addition of Margo Martindale as a campaign strategist for Alicia's governor husband Peter, who has his eye on higher office."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Okay, there's some inadvertently amusing early CGI you have to look past, but watching these episodes now, 20 years after the show began, it's impressive to see how they hold up and how beloved a series The Next Generation rightfully remains."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Gene Roddenbury must not have had a cynical bone in his body, and as I watched his characters explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and boldly go where no one has gone before, I didn't either."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,One of the main elements that the show got right was its insistence on portraying the universe as a huge and wondrous and terrifying place.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Whether or not ""The Next Generation"" went where no one went before, it was always a trip worth taking, and in tomorrow night's episode, it is a profoundly moving voyage as good as any episode in either series."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Still going boldly, updated series is fun for all."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"While things were rocky behind the scenes and on-screen, The Next Generation has still earned its place not just in the pantheon of Star Trek, but in the pantheon of TV series, period. It's what all other science fiction shows aspire to."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,[Patrick] Stewart and [John] de Lancie take great joy from the script that has them bouncing off each other like some cosmic double act.
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"There are very few great episodes in this year, but the fantastic series finale saves it from oblivion."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,"Today is for the people we love and the lives we share with them. With this crew by our side, anything is possible. With a good ship and better company, the sky's the limit."
Star Trek: The Next Generation,1,Still one of the most successful drama series ever put into syndication.
Younger,0,"The most overwhelming emotion I feel is relief. The last season, number seven, was pretty excruciating."
Younger,1,"It's sad that the Younger carousel will stop spinning this season, but we're grateful for the dizzying ride."
Younger,1,"As to the new season, and without going into details, the game board will again be turned over, the cards thrown in the air to put relationships out of joint, interfere with plans, raise questions."
Younger,1,"While enjoyable, these plotlines don't feel like an ""ending"" to Younger. Rather this season feels ""business as usual"" as opposed to a series finale. At first, I was disappointed by the lack of stakes, but upon further review, this really is fitting."
Younger,1,"As fun as it has been to see the show highlight the rise of millennials, it's even more fun to watch them all struggle to deal with the fact they are getting older."
Younger,1,"I gotta tell you, it is about time this show returned. This rom-com is the comforting, silly escape we all need these days, isn't it?"
Younger,1,"Ultimately, the episodes are engaging as ever, and though it's rare with final seasons, I find myself struggling to squash the belief that this show still has so much left to give."
Younger,1,"I have spent seven years with this team soaking in fab fashion, romance, and New York City, so it's tough to say goodbye and close this chapter."
Younger,1,I can't help but wish a TV movie or a supersized finale had been decided upon instead of a 12-episode final season.
Younger,1,"In its final episodes, Younger remains as fizzy as the Champagne that gets poured at all those rooftop parties that Liza & Co. get to attend."
Younger,1,"Although it takes a couple episodes to really get into its stride, as the plot thickens things are soon back on track with that distinctive mix of workplace drama, surprisingly adult humour, and page-turner storylines."
Younger,1,"Throughout its tenure, YOUNGER has been the platonic ideal of comfort TV."
Younger,1,"I love that the show had the kind of juicy love triangle usually reserved for teen dramas. I loved Josh, especially the mature way the series has allowed Liza and Josh to remain friends. But I was always #TeamCharles."
Younger,1,"The final season brings back the wit, heart, and binge-ability of Younger's finest moments."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"The series is funny, humane, deadpan and realistic."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"During its short but perfectly formed run, it forced its audience to laugh through the awkwardness of adolescence."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks reminds us that we're often closest to our true selves when we're alone and not performing for our peers, particularly during our painfully self-conscious teen years."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"It's worth watching just to see baby versions of people like James Franco, Jason Siegel, Seth Rogan, Busy Phillips, and others, but it's also a genuine take on high school and the constant need to feel like you belong."
Freaks and Geeks,1,''Freaks and Geeks'' can't escape its sense of borrowed wonder. But at least it has some.
Freaks and Geeks,1,At the very least ... this is a rare hour of TV with big possibilities.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"It's hard to sum up an entire season of incredible television in just a few words, but Freaks and Geeks turns out to be every bit as groundbreaking and wonderful as we all heard."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"It just lets viewers watch, and through careful screenwriting, makes them understand. It's not about what choices the characters make, it's about why they make them and what they hope to get out of them."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"This is the perfect introduction into the world. Not only have we immediately become immersed from the jump thanks to Joan Jett's Bad Reputation as well as a slew of other songs used in this episode, but the costuming drives the point home."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Above all, it is a show made with purest love and affection for the ones who couldn't get the hang of high school."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks and Geeks finds abundant humor in the absurdity of the situations the characters face.
Freaks and Geeks,1,Forget 90210 and Dawson's Creek. This series shows real-looking kids dealing with real-life issues.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"In addition to fresh, sharp writing, the casting in Freaks and Geeks is exceptional. This is one of the few high-school shows in which the actors actually look like they could be in high school."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks is a frisky little triumph of real spirit.
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks and Geeks is tapping into something primal: adolescents' hunger to begin to understand themselves and their world. Freaks and Geeks is too honest to offer answers. But it affirms the value and the universality of asking the questions.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"The young actors are natural and convincing, and the high school characters manage to be funny without too much Dawson's Creek glibness."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Paul Feig have fashioned a dramatic comedy that perhaps gets it a tad too right. Freaks and Geeks carries a sheen of bleakness, of sadness and depression that strives to equate the lives of middle teens with those of infantrymen on the front lines."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks is that wonderful rarity among television series, a show that simultaneously lampoons reality and embraces it."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"This show only produced 18 episodes, but it's been lauded and beloved for 16 years since its unceremonious axing."
Freaks and Geeks,1,The show deals with situations that we can all relate to. It is a very rare thing to see a television show with such love for its characters and its world - a true gem.
Freaks and Geeks,1,Mass audiences are only interested in reliving high school if it's sentimentalized. The chance to revisit something remotely in the ballpark of the real thing is as appetizing as cafeteria food-and Freaks and Geeks was a weekly feast of teen awkwardness.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks, despite its numerous flaws and hinting at Apatow's subsequent reliance on man-child humor in his feature films, often succeeds as humanist comedy precisely because the characters at its center are teenagers."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks distinguishes itself by the eerie realism of its portrayal of suburban high school life, circa 1980, from the ugly, boring clothes, to the across-the-board wonderful acting to the refreshing lack of narration."
Freaks and Geeks,1,The most believable thing about this utterly believable show is that virtually every episode is made to pivot on an experience intrinsic to teenage life: embarrassment.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Watching the show often feels like an out-of-body experience, as if one were watching oneself navigate through high school. This is exactly what makes the show so timeless."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"On the geeks' side, Martin Starr is simply brilliant as Bill, a lanky kid who's both bumblingly incoherent and strangely charismatic - words really can't do him justice, but suffice it to say he's one of the all-time great TV nerds, Screech be damned."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"A series with the uninviting name Freaks and Geeks offers the most sensitive, touching and, yes, humorous look at the joys and pains of adolescence since The Wonder Years."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"The humanism at Freaks And Geeks' heart lies entirely in its staunch, palpable belief that the smallest stories about marginalized figures not only deserve to be told, but have immeasurable worth."
Freaks and Geeks,1,Freaks And Geeks works as well as it does because it's about fundamentally good people.
Freaks and Geeks,1,"Freaks and Geeks boasts an extremely talented cast, evident by the fact that most of the members have gone on to notable careers in television and film."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"This almost goes without saying, but in addition to being incredibly moving and relatable, Freaks and Geeks is extremely funny. No other show has captured the inherent humor of being an awkward teenager quite like this series did."
Freaks and Geeks,1,"This may be the first TV show since Pee-wee's Playhouse to treasure youth even as it embodies all of its contradictions, craziness, hopes, and fears."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,It strikes a tone that will be unfamiliar to longtime fans. But it’s also good enough in its own right and worthy of the same leeway to accomplish what DS9 did so many years ago -- mark its own place within the Star Trek universe.
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Star Trek: Prodigy is a rip-roaring adventure that will keep adults engaged, make kids think, and opens up endless possibilities for Star Trek more than any other series since the 1966 original."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"There’s potential here, albeit of a moderate sort -- the character banter, with an ensemble featuring not just one but four different versions of comic relief, is passable, and John Noble could (and maybe is) do this kind of role in his sleep."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"It's great to encourage younger audiences to boldly go themselves, but it also makes it difficult to pin the series' longevity and its utility beyond franchise newbies. Altogether, still an engaging and gorgeous series."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,Lost and Found is a necessary establishment of character and core story. Prodigy could well be a grower.
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"For those who have never heard of Starfleet, (and by extension, Star Trek) its a way to discover this world and its intentions of unity and moving forward as a collective than the individual. Its absolutely amazing!"
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"But whatever Prodigy has planned with its game-changing engine, there's something quite beautiful about a show with so many connections back to Star Trek: Voyager..."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Star Trek: Prodigy is a treat for the eyes, as the creators choose a completely digital animation style that makes each scene feel engaging and eye-catching."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"the double-sized premiere of Prodigy seems to be entirely in its own lane, refreshingly unconcerned with previous Star Trek series until two minutes before the closing credits."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"With its cinematic artistry, immersive score, and layered character development, this is NOT your parents' weekly prime time cartoon."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"The new cast is fun with lots of appeal for younger viewers, and Ella Purnell's Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui's Rok-Tahk are already stealing a lot of their scenes due to their nuanced and empathetic vocal work."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,It's a fun way to extend the franchise that gives the series' writers a lot of room to experiment.
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"Might make some parents smile... My 7-year-old son has already asked to re-watch the second episode of Prodigy so this latest ""Trek"" is certainly well-calibrated to capture the interest of its target audience."
Star Trek: Prodigy,0,"The show mostly just transparently trades off the ""Trek"" title without feeling like it's going anywhere, boldly or otherwise."
Star Trek: Prodigy,1,"A visually stunning, hope filled & unique story -- for new and old Star Trek fans alike!"
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"While on the surface it appears to be nostalgia-bait, closer inspection reveals that at the heart of Lower Decks pumps one the most earnest and well-told Trek series to date, propelled by great characters and its love but critique of the franchise."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,But by balancing that lighthearted sense of nostalgia with a more serious engagement with the entire premise of Star Trek...Lower Decks season two continues to punch above its weight.
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"There is no doubt - Season 2 is, overall, a stronger year of Lower Decks than Season 1."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,Star Trek: Lower Decks has already done a fantastic job of really diving into the internal conflict and privileges of the typical Starfleet bridge crew and the tough lives our lower deckers live.
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"It's always difficult to review a show without seeing the full season and knowing how the character and story arcs play out, but so far, Lower Decks season 2 remains a highly enjoyable way to ""engage"" with the Star Trek universe."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"Lower Decks has captured the essence of why so many people love Trek in general, that unique combination of likable characters, who are good people, doing ""sci-fi stuff."" In this way, ""Strange Energies"" is near perfect."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"A confident improvement on an already solid first season, Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 2 is a fun sci-fi romp for hardcore Trekkies and non-believers alike."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"The ability to bring in new elements and still keep the core in place is a key part of a strong Trek show, as the blending of the work-place drama and the anthology series is a large part of the franchise's continued drawing power."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"For as much as the general love for Trek permeates this show, Lower Decks really has begun to come into its own with its own characters and its own unique spin on what makes a story work in this particular vision for the 24th century."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,"In season two, Lower Decks continues that balanced groove with even more confidence in mixing comedy with away mission hijinks and character progression."
Star Trek: Lower Decks,1,The premiere hits us with the consequences of all this disruption on both the large and small scale.
Frasier,1,"Final episodes of long-running series are almost impossible to craft, and this one had its flaws. The episode never found a comfortable rhythm, which left one feeling emotionally jangled from time to time."
Frasier,1,"Deftly mixing genuine warmth with screwball farce in what became its hallmark, the series rolls out the big emotional guns while providing a small reminder of what brought it such acclaim through its 11-year run."
Frasier,1,"The final episode itself had kind of a quiet dignity about it even with the screwball comedy involving Daphne's brothers. It was really great to see everyone on the show finally ""grow up"", Frasier in particular."
Frasier,1,It seems right that the series end on a high note.
Frasier,1,Comedy has moved on. We've moved on... But then last night was one of those flickers of happier times. Actually it was pretty damn good.
Frasier,1,"Whenever it sticks closely with the Crane brothers, however, this likely final season of Frasier often ranks with some of the series' best work."
Frasier,1,"The men of the Crane family have come the furthest in these 11 years; they love, support and--gasp!--respect each other. It's not surprising to realize that--11 years later--we do too."
Nathan for You,1,"Do yourself a favor and watch Nathan For You: A Celebration, a hilarious look back on the first three seasons."
Nathan for You,1,"""Celebration"" has a certain ""neither fish nor fowl"" quality to it that makes it occasionally frustrating. But it works as a full-length teaser for the upcoming season, and it goes far enough beyond that to work decently enough as a standalone episode."
Nathan for You,1,"It's funny! Very, very, very funny."
Scorpion,1,"If you were feeling at all nostalgic for Katharine McPhee's Smash days, [Season 4's] musical number must have been heaven... excluding Toby, Sylvester and Cabe's flamenco costumes, of course."
Scorpion,1,What is going to make Scorpion super interesting this season is the balance between Paige and Walter now that there's an official relationship on the books.
Scorpion,1,"If there was a show that could pull off a random musical intro, Scorpion is definitely it."
Under the Dome,1,"We're left with the show revived once again, an Under The Dome redux, as this week's episode title puts it. And damn it if it hasn't succeeding in sparking my interest yet again."
Under the Dome,0,"Under the Dome limped toward the finish, all right. But it's because the show shot itself in the foot."
Under the Dome,0,There's a difference between a storyline and just writing a load of nonsense. Vote with your remote.
Under the Dome,0,"If there was a destination or a point in mind, it's well past the point of mattering now."
Under the Dome,1,The most relatable aspects of Under the Dome focus on the question of sustainability.
Under the Dome,0,"The torturous double-feature of ""Move On"" and ""But I'm Not"" may as well have been in Swahili or Dome-anese because I haven't the foggiest about what actually happened in it. Are we even sure they showed the right episode?"
Under the Dome,1,"All things considered, this was a solid, if unspectacular return for the show."
Under the Dome,1,"Under the Dome is certainly broadcast television's most enjoyable science-fiction/fantasy series, a summer treat that, while sometimes silly and over-the-top, is never less than energetically imaginative and aware of the history of its genre."
Under the Dome,1,"As far as answers go, we may not have gotten the full monty, but an effort was made to drive us toward (hopefully) the endgame."
Under the Dome,1,"This is all derivative, of course, cribbing from The Matrix and (as always) Lost, but this show is always more fun when it leans into its sci-fi elements."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Star Trek's first Black Captain, Benjamin Sisko, is an amazing character whose Blackness never feels dialed down."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"By doing away with Gene Roddenberry's ridiculous utopian vision of the future (no poverty, no colds, no racial strife), DS9 had a much more realistic view of the human condition. And, unlike the other series, it rarely offered good-vs-evil plots."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Special effects during the extensive battle sequences, with fleets of starships attacking each other in outer space, are unprecedentedly complex for Star Trek."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"It's an exciting and moving close to a series that still had so much life left in it. Major arcs are brought to an end and entirely new ones are begun, but the most important thing is that the show left on its own terms and in its own way"
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Deep Space 9 was Star Trek at its most artful and impactful. More than that, it was science fiction at its most incisive."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,The best Star Trek is Deep Space Nine.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Simultaneously downbeat and optimistic in its refusal to bring the story to an end, there's something effortlessly fitting about the way that Trek's most challenging incarnation draws to a close."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Like the best of the Star Trek franchise, the show pushes viewers to consider the moral, ethical, and political questions surrounding foreign aid and nation-building."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"A welcome change of pace from the horrors of season seven's war arc, this episode was a brave study of post-traumatic stress and its devastating repercussions for an endearing character."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is much better than The Next Generation and worthy your time. It is a surprisingly mature, complex, ambitious, and exciting Star Trek endeavor."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,The season had something for everyone.
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"Deep Space Nine, for all its Prophets and visions and prophecy, was always more interested in the complicated ways that people fit together than it was in god fights and prophecy."
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,1,"[It] gets more interesting and compelling with each succeeding year and it signed off at its peak: the final season doesn't lack for ambition and, apart from a TV budget that starves the visual sweep, it succeeds in meeting it with only minor caveats"
Everybody Hates Chris,1,"[It] was a family sitcom that both harkened back to the Norman Lear comedies of old, while still retaining the rapid pace and tight construction of the best single-camera productions."
Everybody Hates Chris,1,"It was sharply written, very funny and didn't shy away from serious topics race and class, like so many feel-good nostalgic comedies [do]."
Everybody Hates Chris,1,"These are Chris' formative years, and although they're played for laughs, there's also poignancy to them."
Everybody Hates Chris,1,The result is a funny show that shines a serious spotlight on race relations.
Everybody Hates Chris,1,"[The] season finale of CW's Everybody Hates Chris, which ended with a fabulous nod to the finale of The Sopranos, did everything you could ask of a clever comedy."
Everybody Hates Chris,1,This warmhearted series is a prime example of how to take serious issues and approach them in a humorous yet thought-provoking way.
Interrogation,1,"Ambitious, non-linear true crime show is edgy, satisfying."
Interrogation,1,It's well-acted with great dialogue and direct lending to some really great and compelling performances. The series is a well-executed yet innovative true-crime series that leaves you guessing.
Interrogation,1,"Interrogation couldn't have properly existed a decade ago, and thus John Mankiewicz & Anders Weidemann deserve special credit for trying something new, especially under the CBS umbrella."
Interrogation,1,"The crime drama lets you watch its middle eight episodes in any order, but it's more powerful as a straightforward story."
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
Interrogation,0,"Ultimately, not unlike the case explored by the detectives, accused killers, and put-upon lawyers of Interrogation, the show doesn't necessarily prove what it's actively trying to prove (crime dramas are interesting if you can choose your own fate)."
Interrogation,1,"So, while I highly recommend Interrogation for the way the crime and its aftermath unfolds and the dedicated performances by its talented cast, I have to recommend that you watch in order."
Interrogation,1,"The show can be a little overheated, especially toward the top, but at most moments, something interesting is going on on-screen, and there are some fine, subtle performances among a smattering of less subtle ones."
Interrogation,0,We have no confidence that this mix-and-match episode format is anything more than a gimmick and will just lead to confused viewers.
Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.
Interrogation,1,"The deeper you dig, the more Interrogation becomes an unusually compelling tragedy of a family shattered by Mary's murder and Eric's conviction."
Interrogation,0,The idea of a Choose Your Own Adventure approach to a crime procedural is certainly exciting on paper; it's a true disappointment that it doesn't work in execution.
Interrogation,1,An interesting idea with an engaging enough story to be worth checking out.
Interrogation,0,"Interrogation is just good enough to be frustrating for the ways in which it isn't yet better, and most of them stem back to the original sin of the show's format."
Coyote,1,"Michael Chiklis gets his biggest role since The Shield in this impressive cross-border crime drama, and he tears into it with great gusto and versatility."
Coyote,1,"The only surprise in Coyote is the quality: It's very good. Sometimes a noir, sometimes a Western, sometimes a tense action thriller and sometimes piquantly funny, Coyote has something for nearly everybody"
Coyote,1,"We'll give Coyote the benefit of the doubt, given the presence of both Chiklis and MacLaren."
Coyote,1,"These final two episodes painted a more nuanced portrait of El Catrin, aka Juan Diego."
Coyote,0,"An unwanted bouquet of loose ends gradually reveals itself - quite possibly the result of the season order being truncated from 10 to six episodes after a COVID work stoppage, but unfortunate and distracting nonetheless."
Coyote,1,"Binge-bait, and compelling binge-bait at that."
Coyote,1,"Coyote benefits by stronger plotting, an authentic sense of place and a more rounded portrayal of the crime family that traps Ben in their internal power struggle."
Coyote,0,"""Coyote"" may find its way to more substance if it's allowed to prowl a bit longer, but like Ben's bowel movements, you're just as likely to be relieved that it's over."
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
Coyote,1,"MacLaren shows her skills with pacing and visual language in the first pair of episodes, making the questionable plotting and dialogue easy to take."
Star Trek: Enterprise,1,"If not everything works in Enterprise's Season Four, it's certainly the most consistently entertaining and well-written season of the show."
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,A sorry end to a landmark franchise.
Star Trek: Enterprise,1,"Season Four is, by far, the strongest of Enterprise's seasons with so many great arcs. Enterprise was mothballed way too early."
Star Trek: Enterprise,1,Coto and crew managed to finally deliver the goods that B&B were fatally unable to: old-fashioned Star Trek action and adventure.
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.
Star Trek,1,"The point that I may be beating into the ground is that if you are willing to accept that the story is more important than the props, then you may find something to appreciate in the original ""Star Trek."""
Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.
Star Trek,0,"Season one changed the genre as we know it, and the second season equally so; it's just a crying shame that the third couldn't have made it a hat trick."
Star Trek,1,"Without recourse to expensive effects or sets, episodes like The Empath are essentially theatrical, and some scenes are surprisingly intense."
Star Trek,0,"The actors seem tired, bored in most scenes. Even [William] Shatner, which is saying something."
Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing."
Star Trek,1,"And perhaps Star Trek's most enduring achievement was to change the way we think about TV. Before Kirk went into space, shows were loved but disposable."
Star Trek,1,"And most significant of all, he wrote complex, multilayered morality tales: stories set in the 23rd century, but with striking parallels for those in the 20th. His achievements can hardly be overstated."
Star Trek,0,Talk about going out on a sour note.
Star Trek,1,The most convincing argument one can give in favour of Season 3 is that even a bad season of Star Trek is worth watching.
Cheers,1,"It Is a dark, suitably melancholy atmosphere as the bar becomes a sight for sore eyes, a place that Is no longer a refuge."
Cheers,1,"As Cheers writers had done so often over the course of 275 episodes, the Charles brothers danced up to the edge of easy sentiment, then spun away with a wink."
Cheers,1,After all the hype... it would be a miracle if the last episode of Cheers could still move you. But then Cheers has always been at least a minor miracle. Thursday night's final episode of the 11-year-old NBC sitcom was a 98-minute masterpiece.
Cheers,1,"Cheers went out the way it came in: with grace, good humor and, above all, class."
Cheers,1,"Although punchy and poignant, the show didn't -- couldn't -- live up to the firestorm of hype that preceded the episode. No show couldn't."
Cheers,1,"It was too long, too much of it was devoted to the worn-out romantic teasing between Sam and Diane and the final musings dragged on a bit. But it was still the best thing on television Thursday night, as it has been for a longtime."
Cheers,0,We waited 11 years for this? Last night's finale kept tantalizing us with possibilities that never quite materialized.
Cheers,0,Yuk. Writers Glen Charles and Les Charles crammed more sloppy sentimental stuff into the last 15 minutes of Thursday's finale than the show exhibited in its entire 11 years.
Cheers,1,"There were some missteps but, for the most part, the last, expanded serving of Cheers paid off in some very big and satisfying ways."
Cheers,1,"It was a memorial, a rip-roaring wake, a reminder of good times past. You don't analyze wakes."
Cheers,1,"There have been great final episodes in the past, but last night's final Cheers was a masterpiece."
Cheers,1,"OK, so the scripts haven't been quite as sterling these past two years. Let's face it -- the situation has been comedied. But even at its weakest, Cheers has been better than 90 percent of the sitcoms on TV."
Cheers,1,"Refusing to preach, ""Cheers"" offered a kind of refuge from contemporary upheavals and anxieties, not totally ignoring them, but also not letting them interfere with the nonstop flow of jokes."
Cheers,1,"The show ended sentimentally but without sappiness. Love was mentioned and so were shoes. It was, simply, perfect."
Cheers,1,"The cast was uniformly in top form under Burrows' astute direction. Cheers' went out with high humor, dignity, and sentiment as it settled accounts."
Cheers,1,"What makes the show highly watchable three decades on is the cracking quality of the dialogue, the comic acting and the weird, yet likeable characters."
The Twilight Zone,1,Serling almost single-handedly set the standard for sophisticated television during the medium's Golden Age and beyond.
The Twilight Zone,1,"At once poignant, eerie, and instantly memorable, the ahead-of-its-time (pun intended) program could teach viewers a lesson just as easily as it freaked them the heck out."
The Twilight Zone,1,"Even in the less successful episodes there's often something to enjoy, perhaps a mediocre script enlivened by the performance of a veteran actor or a young up-and-comer."
The Twilight Zone,1,Some of the absolute best episodes of The Twilight Zone explore the stigmas and fears around mental illness-namely the paranoid feeling that no one around them will believe them.
The Twilight Zone,1,Both the performances from Nelson and Malone and Earl Hamner Jr.'s script work to make them two of the most believable and well fleshed out characters in the series' history.
The Twilight Zone,1,"If it were possible to convert nightmares into electricity, we'd have all the power we could ever need thanks to The Twilight Zone."
The Twilight Zone,1,Fake dolls threats are all too real.
The Twilight Zone,1,"Actress Collin Wilcox is so fiercely intelligent and likable as Marilyn, that it makes what eventually happens to her just that much more chilling."
The Twilight Zone,1,William Shatner blessed us with his overacting in this airborne episode.
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
The Twilight Zone,1,This paranoid episode does for toys what Jaws did for the deep end of the pool.
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
The Twilight Zone,1,It sneaks in subversion by pretending to be exactly what it's subverting... Perhaps my favorite TV drama ever made.
The Twilight Zone,0,"For its final episode, The Twilight Zone gives us something it spent most of its time railing against: a happy ending of perfect, selfish bliss."
Waco,1,"A very sad story, but a very well-made series. It's a tough thing to watch, but you watch for the incredible performances, a must-watch if you're interested in true stories..."
Waco,1,"Netflix has found an off-service hit in the form of Waco, a powerful retelling of a tragedy with a deeply impressive cast."
Waco,1,Waco wastes no time getting to the point. [Full Review in Spanish]
Waco,0,"While Shannon's performance is full of the strengths that have made The Shape of Water star such a sinewy actor, there isn't much acknowledgement in this small-screen version of the complexities of what really went down."
Waco,1,Waco is an excellent addition to the subgenre.
Waco,1,"However, Kitsch, Shannon, and the rest of the crew elevate the material in every scene. Despite wanting more show and less tell, the series is compelling television."
Waco,1,"Though Kitsch's impersonation of Koresh makes Waco worth sticking with, Michael Shannon matches that dynamism."
Waco,1,It's probably the best account we will ever have of what happened on April 19th and the 51 days leading up to it.
Waco,1,"As is Waco rates as a reasonably effective dramatization of what led to the siege, and little more."
Waco,1,"Whether he's hanging with the guys and playing in a local rock band or preaching to his flock, Kitsch's convincing performance of Koresh is what keeps all eyes on Waco."
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
Waco,0,"Waco has done far more ironing out than enriching in the episodes leading up to next week's grand finale. The Dowdles have hamstrung their own ambitions, reducing Waco from a reckoning with the muddled past to an oversimplification of it."
Waco,1,"All of this is interesting, to be sure, but the most fascinating aspect of this story is Koresh's rise as a cult leader, the events that led so many people to abandon their lives and possessions to be in his presence was what happened before the siege."
Waco,0,"The intimate humanization of Koresh and his followers comes across as a pure defense, a vindication of the rights of fringe groups to exist with huge stockpiles of guns without attracting the eye of law enforcement."
Waco,1,"Waco's strength comes from the fact that it doesn't deal in moral absolutes - there is no black and white here, and we all must examine our sins - and endure the consequences."
Waco,1,It's in the interactions between the Branch Davidians and the federal government that the Dowdles best capture the sense of an easily avoidable yet nonetheless inevitable catastrophe.
Waco,0,Violent docudrama has unsettling depiction of cult leader.
Waco,1,"Waco is intriguing and just getting started. As a Texan myself, I was too young to remember this happening in the nineties, but watching this show made me curious for more."
Waco,1,"It featured strong, capable performances, and a decent stab at devout-but-devious Koresh by Taylor Kitsch, but at times it underwhelmed."
Waco,1,"The strength of its lead performances, along with some excellent production design, gives Waco an edge it might otherwise not have had, due in part to how uneven the script feels at times."
Waco,1,The Waco series seems overly eager to vindicate Koresh. And that taints an otherwise well-told story.
Waco,1,"Even with some thin characterization, the cast is star-studded and delivering their A-game. Before the guns start firing and the flames begin to burn, Waco will be wise to let their stellar actors have some quiet conversations."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Waco,1,"Like the Unabomber miniseries last year on cable, this one is better than you'd expect, though you might be taken aback with how sympathetic Koresh and his cult are..."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
Waco,1,Taylor Kitsch disappears effortlessly into the role.
Waco,1,"A compelling, tragic tale that allows stars like Kitsch and Shannon to play different, surprising roles, just like the new cable channel that's featuring the show."
Waco,1,"We mainly need to look to Kitsch's performance, along with writers John Erick and Drew Dowdle's screenplay ... commanding, but never quite intimidating (or is he?)."
Waco,1,The series does a good job of showing both sides of the story with Michael Shannon playing an FBI hostage negotiator advocating for less-violent means of action.
Waco,0,"Despite a fantastic cast, with a particularly outstanding performance by Taylor Kitsch, the miniseries' desire to make Koresh a folk hero is a miscalculation."
Waco,1,"The reenactments of the government assault on the compound, and the aggressive response by the cult, are well-staged."
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
Waco,1,"Kitsch is quite convincing as Koresh. He plays Koresh as genuine, if not saintly, and that laconic Tim Riggins charisma is put to good use, or icky use if you keep waiting for the miniseries to find anything Koresh does problematic."
Waco,1,"Waco is thought-provoking, risky, and engaging, with the type of nuanced performances that should garner Emmy nominations."
Waco,0,"It's so busy delivering Spam-sized chunks of ham-fisted dialogue defending the misunderstood Koresh, it loses all those other critical threads that make Waco a cautionary tale for all sides."
Waco,0,More notable for its casting than its execution.
Waco,1,"... still a necessary and sometimes powerful series, particularly in the third hour..."
Waco,1,The key choice here was the casting of Mr. Kitsch... who radiates sincerity and has an overflowing charisma that the real-life Koresh is said to have lacked.
Waco,1,"Though it's difficult to say whether or not the 1993 Waco siege warrants revisiting, the Paramount Network's new six-part miniseries does the best job of examining such a loaded question."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Waco,0,"Despite a partially successful attempt to set the record straight, Waco too rarely offers the kind of depth that would make the examination of these powerful motivations compelling."
Waco,1,"With a wealth of source material, Waco crafts a sturdy if inelegant study of how it all went so wrong, aided by almost uniformly strong performances that work to sell merely adequate dialogue."
Waco,1,"The series may not add anything new to the conversation, but it's a prestige-quality exploration of the echoes of a historic tragedy."
Waco,1,"Waco won't be setting any new bars for true crime fiction, but it's a solid and timely reminder of just how easily we can be swayed by loud and confident people, regardless of what's coming out of their mouths."
Waco,1,"Don't expect ""Waco"" to break out as one of 2018's stealth critical successes or award magnets. Still and all, it is adequate television - succinct and informative enough to at least glance at sideways."
Waco,0,"The Paramount Network needs something flashy and bold to ring in its launch, and Waco isn't it. The show should have been used as an addition to something bold, not as a starting move."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,The upshot is that Janeway is put in the kind of moral quandary that Trek thrives on: Should she let the entire Borg Collective perish to save an innocent few?
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"This is the show's series finale, and probably its final farewell."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,"The series finale features a future that seeks to undo itself by righting previous wrongs, but there's so much more to be found than simply rehash."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,Voyager reigns as the most infuriating and creatively haphazard Star Trek series for how it squandered such a great premise.
Star Trek: Voyager,1,"[Endgmae is] no All Good Things, but it wraps things up well and gives Kate Mulgrew a real chance to shine in dual roles."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,"In Captain Janeway, for all her inability to make up her mind how she felt about the Prime Suggestion, we had the most adventurous captain since Kirk, a captain who goes on away missions and takes sometimes extraordinary risks to achieve her goals."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"A great theme, gorgeous title sequence and some of the most patronising tales Star Trek has ever managed - it's no contest, Voyager is a dud."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"Everyone on Voyager deserved better, especially Kathryn Janeway."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,"Voyager may have presided over the property's decline, but looking back Voyager eventually found what it was looking for: not just plot resolution, but also a character study about strong personalities longing for a place they can call home."
Star Trek: Voyager,1,"When Voyager was firing on all cylinders, stories this rich popped up every week."
Key & Peele,1,"""Key & Peele"" once again displays compelling characters, crazy adventures and political satire, offering up a hilarious look at the world utilizing the stars' lively chemistry and keen observations."
Key & Peele,1,"Key & Peele is not like other sketch shows, and its excellent, hour-long series finale, which alternated between callbacks and ambitious, off-the-wall bits, felt strangely of a piece with its stars' body of work over the past three years."
Key & Peele,1,"As Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele said good-bye to their boundary-pushing Comedy Central show, they made one interesting choice that punctuated five seasons of social commentary."
Key & Peele,0,"There was also room in the finale for some of the pop culture-inspired silliness that ""Key & Peele"" does every bit as well as the hot-button subjects."
Key & Peele,1,"After an episode of ""Key & Peele,"" not only do you laugh, but you feel like your brain was fed. It's like taking a comedy vitamin."
Key & Peele,1,"Key & Peele will go down in history as one of the greatest sketch shows of all time, one that redefined the ""filmic"" sketch and established such a strong viral presence."
Key & Peele,1,"So...goodbye, valets. Goodbye, substitute teacher. Goodbye, Hingle McCringleberry. We'll never forget you (or be able to say your name without giggling)."
Key & Peele,1,"Did it at some point pass Chappelle's Show, for instance, as Comedy Central's best sketch series? I would say it did (though Inside Amy Schumer still has some time to catch up)."
Key & Peele,1,Key & Peele ended its five-season run with a spot in the comedy pantheon secure.
Key & Peele,1,These interstitial sequences continue to drive (heh-heh) home the quick-witted nature of these guys. They have an improv background...you don't say!
Key & Peele,1,"The series still has life and is willing to take risks, which gives us faith that the new season has some treats in store for sketch comedy fans."
Key & Peele,1,Key & Peele's fifth season premiere is a bit like getting a terrific high five from your coolest friend at a party that's so cool you can't even believe you were invited.
Key & Peele,1,"Key and Peele returns to Comedy Central on Wednesday night with an exceedingly strong half-hour that once again demonstrates the range of not only the duo's performance skills, but their ideas as well."
Key & Peele,1,"Key and Peele distinguish themselves from other comedians on-air by being palpably relaxed; the pair has no histrionic energy, and nothing in particular to prove."
Key & Peele,1,"Overall, the show feels quieter, more reflective and, if anything, even more cerebral than before."
Key & Peele,1,Both are brilliant mimics and outrageously creative improv stars who now comprise the most successful comedy duo on television.
Key & Peele,1,"Only Key and Peele could get away with something that extreme, making you laugh till it hurts."
Workaholics,1,[In the finale] they hit upon an ambitious idea: Bermu-dope High-angle. The rest is...stoner engineering at its finest.
Workaholics,1,"The overall show is well written, and the cast's comedic talent is apparent despite the inane exploits feature here."
Workaholics,1,"This very much feels like any other season of the show rather than the clock ticking down to some big grand finale. That being said, episodes like ""Termidate"" are the sort of entries that pop especially well in final seasons."
Workaholics,1,An unforgettable series finale adventure.
Workaholics,1,"There's funny stuff to be found here, largely in the guys' always-entertainingly loose banter."
Limitless,1,"The show just works. Yes, it does have that feel of a normal guy turned superhero vibe to it but we can overlook it, with all the great actors and catchy storylines the show has developed..."
Limitless,1,"The series begins with a familiar mix of FBI procedural and cheeky class clown comedy but the series gets more clever with the humor in later episodes, goofing on Brian's narration and playing games with shifting perspectives..."
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
Limitless,0,A good sci-fi flick forced into a generic procedural TV show.
Limitless,1,"This continuation of the Limitless brand plays like an effectively smart sequel, using the story that spawned it as a springboard rather than a blueprint."
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
Limitless,1,It certainly seems that the creative team was using one hundred percent of their brains when building Limitless.
Limitless,0,"It's relatively engaging and slickly produced, with effective visuals showcasing Eddie's new talents, but the side effect of this show may be fatal blandness."
Limitless,1,"The network has done much, much worse than Limitless. That sounds like faint praise, but in this disastrous fall season, it's not. I'm in on this show for a few weeks."
Limitless,1,The show is definitely in the hands of those with a solid enough track record to believe it will settle into a nice rhythm at CBS.
Limitless,0,"There's a story to be told about what it means to be human in a tech-wild, catastrophe-rocked, profoundly uncertain age. Maybe someday, TV will give us that story. Until then, we get generic label pop like Limitless."
Limitless,1,"The pilot was entertaining enough for what it was, notable for some nutty ideas here and there (looking at you, talking fetus) that show what the series could be if it really went for broke and did some crazy stuff you might not expect."
Limitless,1,Limitless has the potential to be a huge hit... if it chooses to unlock it like a dose of NZT.
Limitless,1,"Thanks to some interesting character dynamics, a just-weird-enough premise and some tantalizing teases of the show's future, I'd say Limitless as a whole is a pretty easy pill to swallow."
Limitless,0,Limitless is an unneeded sequel to a should-be-forgotten 2011 sci-fi flick.
Limitless,0,"Sad to see the great Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter in such a lesser cop show, another network one that tries to keep us past the commercial breaks with action and CGI razzle-dazzle."
Limitless,0,"Those who haven't seen the Bradley Cooper film this is based on may enjoy the novelty of it more than I did, but I mostly found it lacking compared to the movie version."
Limitless,0,It's just not fun enough to be memorable.
Limitless,1,"The first episode is a cut or two better than so-so, with Cooper's brief but pivotal appearance something that many opening night viewers might be willing to wait on."
Limitless,1,The fact that Bradley is excited about what's going on -- that he doesn't get all angst-y -- is something Limitless has going in its favor.
Limitless,1,"But for one episode anyway, Limitless's potential seems ... well, hardly limitless, but perhaps promising."
Limitless,0,"Limitless may give you an immediate high, but side effects may include listlessness, dangerous plot holes and a sinking feeling you've wasted an hour of your life."
Limitless,0,"McDorman is solid as an Everyman-turned-Superhuman, and Carpenter... is perhaps the most welcome sight of the fall. Still, one can't help wishing she were in a more inspired role and a less worked-over concept."
Limitless,1,"Mentalist and Sherlock fans looking to fill their procedural need may find some delights here, and the show's editing and direction help kick series this up a notch."
Limitless,0,"The superhero aspects can be fun to watch, but they don't make a lot of sense."
Limitless,1,"Limitless at least seems to have a sliver of a sense of humor, and its voice-over works better than other shows'."
Limitless,0,Turns out there are limits when it comes to adapting movies into TV-and the feeble sequel to 2011's Limitless is especially off-putting...
Limitless,1,Strong continuation of the feature film about a man who gets his mind expanded.
Limitless,0,"With this new series, CBS seems to have squandered the potential of a weird, compelling premise by cramming it into an average procedural crime-show mold."
Limitless,1,"Looking past the false notion that we only use 10 percent of our brains, the world of Limitless shows a lot of potential for the small screen, particularly with the movie's star and director involved."
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
Limitless,1,The producers here may have finally cracked the McDorman code.
Limitless,1,"McDorman, a great screen presence who may have finally found the right vehicle, sells the effects of the drugs. I'm ready to take a few more pills to see where things go."
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
Limitless,0,Limitless will continue to fill up the middle with lots of middling material.
Limitless,1,Limitless makes for a lively show with an addictive potential.
Limitless,1,"Luckily McDorman, who appeared in American Sniper with Cooper, has an easygoing charm that helps right the boat. But let's hope that boat sails somewhere more interesting than crime-of-the-week waters"
Limitless,0,"Limitless comes off as rote, slick and bloodless.The show is based on the film of the same name and expect occasional Bradley Cooper drop-ins, but unless Limitless lives up to its name and starts achieving far more of its potential, I'll pass."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Limitless,0,The writers trade preposterous for convenient.
Limitless,1,"Something about this show just works from the crisply polished start, using a premise that is squarely within one of CBS's favorite wheelhouses - the edgy hero who is gifted with extraordinary mental powers..."
Limitless,1,"It's not Mr. Robot, but as far as broadcast pilots go, Limitless is a perfect example of how to do one right. The premiere episode is one of the most narratively efficient hours of television to be produced this year."
Limitless,1,"Limitless is odd because it, like all such shows, celebrates the quirks and heart and talent of its protagonist, who in this case happens to be a ... completely mediocre guy."
Limitless,1,"A star in the making, McDorman plays the character with smooth conviction, and the riveting pilot is full of visual flourishes."
Limitless,1,Here's hoping the writers find a way to keep the show's more anarchic elements (for a CBS series) alive in subsequent episodes.
Limitless,1,"The story lines are limitless, too."
Limitless,1,"Limitless isn't bad, but it's not mind-expanding."
Limitless,1,Limitless deserves a sampling and then a second look. It could be either a temporary high or truly addictive.
RuPaul's Drag Race,1,"The season’s most opinionated queen may have gotten the dreaded “villain edit.” But her unfiltered honesty isn’t just entertaining, it’s what more reality shows need."
RuPaul's Drag Race,1,"Even if the show no longer seems as novel as it once did, here’s hoping that Drag Race will charge on, blowing minds."
RENO 911!,1,"The lack of an overall narrative or even the sense that there should be one fits the Quibi structure, even if some of the humor seems a little stale and dated."
RENO 911!,0,"Unfortunately, that same sense of nostalgic comfort is also the show's greatest weakness; for better and for worse, the show (and its sense of humor) hasn't changed a whit since it went off the air in 2009."
RENO 911!,1,"For audiences who missed the boat this is unlikely to convert them, while avid fans will look upon this offering as a homecoming opportunity."
RENO 911!,1,"This is a worthwhile return to the not so mean streets of Reno, Nevada replete with ridiculous characters and infinitely quotable moments."
RENO 911!,1,"Sure, few would complain of getting more Reno, but the quick bites are just as indulgent as the show of yore with far less filler."
RENO 911!,1,A perfect balance between vulgarity and smart humor. [Full Review in Spanish]
RENO 911!,1,"More importantly, the show's razor-sharp sense of humor is still intact."
RENO 911!,1,"Perfectly accessible for new audiences and just as hilarious as ever for fans of the original series and spinoff film, Reno 911! has found a perfect format in Quibi."
Invader Zim,1,"As gothic Christmas specials go, it's scarier than anything Tim Burton ever dreamed up, and Invader ZIM's satire of human stupidity only seems to grow more prescient as the years go by."
Invader Zim,1,Jhonen Vasquez' cult classic cartoon is one of the most underrated of the '00s and this wild holiday special is a perfect example of its twisted genius.
Invader Zim,1,"The spastic E.T., along with the world around him, capitalizes on cheeky, masochistic, and random humor in ways viewers of all ages can appreciate."
Jericho,0,"Was it good? Was it bad? For me, it was neither. It was simply ""meh,"" and I'm glad the misery is over."
Jericho,1,"If the plots in Jericho can be a little too transparent, the ideas are fun to chew on, in a what-if sort of way. The world is well-constructed, down to the details."
Jericho,1,"Compressing an entire season's worth of action and twists and turns into a mere seven episodes, Jericho barrels along like a runaway train, stopping only to take on fresh shipments of paranoia."
Jericho,1,"The dialogue's still pulpy, but its action story is the bomb."
Jericho,0,Whom can you trust? What can you do? Where the hell is this going?
Jericho,1,"Was this resurrection worth the effort? In a word, yes."
Jericho,1,"I'll never be a Jericho nut, but I'm all for performers like these who'll inject some cracked intensity into this grim fantasy."
Jericho,0,"On paper, the idea of building a new democracy from the ruins of war while government contractors run amok is just as strong as the original premise of Jericho. But the execution remains mediocre."
Jericho,1,Jericho is more than an 800-pound metaphor. It works because it gets the little dramas right.
Jericho,0,"Well the good news is that the show is kinda-sorta ratcheting up the focus on the ""what happened"" story, plus it's looking more into how the country as a whole is dealing with its post-nukey self. The bad news is, I totally don't care anymore. At all."
Review,1,Forrest's commitment to his ridiculous job makes Review some of the most arresting comedy in recent memory.
Review,1,"No matter where Forrest ends up at the conclusion of Review, it's been a comically twisted journey that I give five stars."
Review,1,"Yes, Review is very strange and dark. But it's also very funny, even -- or maybe especially -- when oblivious Forrest makes a total mess of everything."
Review,1,Has there ever been a show that so profoundly plumbed the depths of human delusion and misery like Review?
Review,1,"Daly's tightly wound performance is so pitch-perfect, and the world around him so meticulously crafted, that the show works almost as well as a drama as it does as a comedy."
Review,1,"I have never seen a network comedy series cram this much brilliantly twisted humor, legitimately gripping suspense and absolute emotional devastation into 30 minutes, and likely never will again."
Review,1,"No reasonable person would subject himself to this job. So Review, disturbingly and effectively, asks: What kind of unreasonable person would do it?"
Review,1,Review: five out of five stars.
Review,1,"TV's most underrated comedy, and one of its most underrated shows, period, is a grand indictment of capitalism itself, a beast that you live to feed until the moment it eats you."
Review,1,Review [is] one of the most aggressively innovative comedies on TV
Review,1,"Andy Daly's Review is a brutal, relentless series, filled with misery, existential dread, death, soul-searching and pure awkwardness. Thankfully, it's also one of the funniest, sharpest shows on television."
Review,1,"If Review ran forever, detailing a never-ending series of adventures, exploits, and horrors, I would watch it forever, laughing and wailing and wincing and then watching again, thanks largely to Daly's virtuoso performance."
Review,1,"While it's bittersweet to see the show ending, it's beautiful to see it concluding on its own terms and doing it with such authoritative class."
Review,1,"Review remains one of the most entertaining, and occasionally quite moving, shows on television."
Review,1,The show is populated by one of the funniest supporting casts on TV.
Review,1,"In showing us the sum of Forrest's travails, Review has given birth to something extraordinary: a bleak, serialized tragedy that inspires spasms of unrestrained laughter."
Review,1,"Still smart and without mercy, 'Review' presents the age-old struggle of a work/life balance (or more accurately, the perils of not having one) as an excruciatingly brutal fable."
Review,1,"Even with few remaining heights left unscaled, the opening of Season 3 shows that Review certainly won't leave with a whimper."
Review,1,"A golden comedy for the ""peakest"" television age, Review defies the odds and comes back to tie a meaningful bow on its unbeatable first two seasons."
Jersey Shore,1,"There is a kind of vacuous, ferocious materialism to the kids of Jersey Shore that makes it the most compelling of these shows. They seem to need all the empty hedonism more than others."
Jersey Shore,1,They came. They drank. They singlehandedly destroyed the reputation of everyone from Jersey. And now they are all grown up and going to get drunk and sloppy off camera.
Jersey Shore,1,"Some brilliant, beleaguered producer made the editorial decision to juxtapose the photo of the balls on the cake next to footage of Mike and Pauly eating the cake, which made for the best split screen moment of the show, or any show, perhaps ever."
Jersey Shore,0,"Just because the Jersey Shore era has come to a close, let's not pump it up with either instant nostalgia or importance."
Jersey Shore,1,"This final season of Jersey Shore is weirdly thrilling: In a culture that has become addicted to train-wrecks, Jersey Shore has become a show about survivors trying to put themselves back together."
Jersey Shore,0,"Now that the Jersey Shore cast members have moved past the reasons they got cast in the first place and, more importantly, become too famous for the show to pretend otherwise, it's time to recycle."
Good Sam,1,Good Sam riffs on what CBS is known for -- comforting problem-of-the-week dramas -- and adds a new level of spice and interest to the proceedings.
Good Sam,1,"Let's take a moment to celebrate Bush's return to TV in a leading role. Sam is perfect for her, and Bush's passion for this project is palpable through the TV."
Good Sam,1,Mainly because Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs are compelling to watch - individually and together - Good Sam rises slightly above the run-of-the-mill network medical procedural. But the relationships and characters will have to evolve to keep us tuning in.
Good Sam,1,"Bush and Isaacs prove well-matched for the task of portraying this particularly thorny, complex relationship."
Good Sam,1,The series has a significant asset in Ms. Bush... she is charming but also makes Sam convincingly competitive
Good Sam,0,An over-emotive hospital soap opera that's even more slavishly bound by the conventions of its genre.
Good Sam,0,Good Sam offers both medical-case-of-the-week and soapy storylines along with the who-needs-who more back-and-forth between father and daughter. This one's more middling OK than good.
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Chappelle's Show,1,"Judging by the first episode, the third season was poised to be as funny and irreverent as the first two."
Chappelle's Show,0,"Without the full force of [Dave] Chappelle's soaring comedic vision, The Lost Episodes is merely a frustrating reminder of great promise unfulfilled."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The quality is not as consistently high nor the content quite as daring as Chappelle's show was at its best, but... he can still be crazily and courageously funny even in bite-size morsels."
Chappelle's Show,1,Part of [Dave] Chappelle's charm is that he makes all this dangerous material look effortless.
Chappelle's Show,1,[Dave] Chappelle's comedy leftovers are still pretty satisfying.
Chappelle's Show,1,"I was really nervous about how it would be, as [Dave] Chappelle was claiming that most of the unused skits where unfunny and not complete, but I was pleasantly surprised."
Chappelle's Show,1,"It's a fitting epitaph for the late, lamented Chappelle's Show."
Chappelle's Show,1,"Sure, you'll laugh loud and long at this first ""Lost"" episode -- and, obviously, that's what's important. But these episodes have a memorial quality to them and, like fame itself, their impact feels fleeting."
Chappelle's Show,0,Comedy Central made a huge mistake in airing unfinished (and mediocre) skits left behind when Chappelle bailed on the network two years ago. That's not to say I can't understand its motivation.
Chappelle's Show,1,"The Lost Episodes isn't an exercise in barrel scraping, fortunately, but it would be a lot easier to enjoy this raw, personal material without twinges of guilt if this were a lovingly assembled bootleg rather than a corporate bid to recoup an investment."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The skits from the first Lost Episode find the comedian in top form, picking on subjects ripe to be picked on. But - and here's where pop psychologists could have a field day - one of the topics is himself."
Chappelle's Show,1,"As three episodes of Chappelle's Show, ""The Lost Episodes"" don't measure up. As three episodes that depict how difficult it is to sustain something with its power, potency, ferocity, and intelligence, ""The Lost Episodes"" are essential."
Chappelle's Show,1,"Ultimately, even in disconnected, abridged, or otherwise compromised form, the funnyman still ranks in the top percentile of his comedy class."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The sketches in the three episodes, like most Chappelle's Show material, get funnier upon multiple viewings."
Chappelle's Show,1,"A fascinating, brilliant, and sometimes maddening collection of three episodes cobbled together, Frankenstein-style, from skits Chappelle made before he famously ditched his show and fled to Africa."
Chappelle's Show,1,"The sketches here are high-grade Chappelle: funny and surprising, if not a full-on riot, as his best work on the show has been. But they also tell the story of an intellectual with an esoteric imagination."
Guilty Party,0,"Unlike Only Murders in the Building, Guilty Party doesnt seem to have much to say about true crime beyond just using it as a backdrop for comedy and mystery...At the very least, Kate Beckinsale is as good as ever."
Guilty Party,1,"This series leans toward the funny end of the spectrum of the ""amateur detective who gets in over their head"" premise, but it also tends to use that comedy to cover up the shakier aspects of the writing."
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party's opening episode presents us with an unbelievable, uncharismatic lead character who seems out of place and ill-equipped for every room she enters."
Guilty Party,1,"While we like Beckinsale's performance in Guilty Party, the show doesn't seem to have enough story elements to really make us latch onto Beth or her quest to get her career back."
Guilty Party,1,"This fish-out-of-water quality alchemizes with Beckinsale's big-screen-size charisma into a highly watchable performance, as ""Guilty Party"" reveals how much Beth is also out of sorts."
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party, which swings from black comedy to high-stakes drama without finding its desired sweet spot somewhere in between, just keeps giving in to Beth's worse instincts without giving its audience any real reasons to care."
Guilty Party,1,Kate Beckinsale is a woman on a half-baked quest for surly redemption in this intriguing new dark comedy-drama.
Guilty Party,0,"Everything that Beth does in this clumsy, unfunny show makes her seem more like someone who's never even taken a journalism class, let alone won a prestigious industry award."
Guilty Party,0,"It's clear that Guilty Party has set out to spin a narrative about a complicated woman working a complicated case. But at this point in the story, the whole thing seems on the verge of buckling under one complication too many."
Guilty Party,0,"While a 30-minute dramatic series is often welcome, ""Guilty Party"" might have been better suited to a one-hour format that would allow Addelman and her team to flesh out the characters and their motivations as well as fine tune the tone."
Detroiters,1,"On top of being hilarious, the show's central duo was touchingly pure."
Detroiters,1,"In Detroiters, silliness is not a way of accenting seriousness; it is a triumph over seriousness, a bold and brightly colored affirmation that yes, actually, life is pretty funny."
Detroiters,1,"It's a very confident show, relaxed and unhurried and utterly aware of what it's trying to say and why, and that makes it not just funny but also a legitimately great TV program."
Detroiters,1,"Detroiters so easily could've been an insular half hour of bro-ey inside jokes, or worse, a Portlandia for the Motor City. Instead, it's a colorful world of dippy, hysterical characters that you want to spend time with. It's joy-inducing stuff."
Detroiters,1,"Detroiters is a goofy, eccentric, heartfelt love letter its namesake city."
Detroiters,1,"Tim and Sam's friendship on and offscreen remains aspirational, as the joyful duo return with more of their sharp and sincere comedy that we desperately need."
Detroiters,1,Season 2 doesn't just improve on the show's stellar rookie year; it catapults the sitcom to must-see status.
Detroiters,1,"It would be really easy to make that cynical show about idiots who can't get their business together, but that isn't Detroiters, and we're all the better for it."
Detroiters,1,"They convey kindness through their stories, and after watching five episodes of Season 2, it's easy to see the series' transformative power."
Detroiters,1,"When Comedy Central picked it up for this second season, it gave Detroiters a second chance to become what it deserves to be - the kind of beloved series that friends and co-workers eagerly recommend to each other."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,It's not clear if Season 4's relative mildness is a result of Schumer's split focus...but Amy still packs in plenty of solid laughs.
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"For Inside Amy Schumer to bounce back, it perhaps needs to veer away from her newfound superstardom and back toward the blunt, abrasive honesty that made her a success to begin with."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Between seasons 3 and 4, Schumer became a bonafide movie star, but instead of treating ""Inside"" like a day job, she's continuing to use it as a platform. Sometimes she strikes out, but she's still got a hell of a swing."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Schumer's dark, violent sketches make us laugh even as they pack a much-needed gut punch. This isn't to say the current season of Inside Amy Schumer isn't funny. She adeptly and hilariously spoofs broad pop culture genres."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,Inside Amy Schumer upped the level of naughty sketch comedy last season and seemingly keeps up the pace as season four starts.
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"All the sketches are well-produced, well-cast, and well-acted, but most are disappointingly underwritten, unfocused, or repetitive."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Even though what I've seen of season four isn't quite as funny as I'd like it to be, I hope that Schumer's benign tyranny of mainstreaming feminism isn't ending anytime soon."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,So there's nothing terribly bad about the new Inside Amy Schumer. But there's also no sketch here that comes close to previous-season wonderfulness.
Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Given Schumer's success, the audience is expecting that genius on a rather more reliable basis. I'm sure it's coming, even if it isn't evident right out of the gate."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,The comedian's back to basics (albeit now with a few celebrity friends) by making the same kind of sketches that made her famous and crafting a few viral hits along the way.
Inside Amy Schumer,1,"Still funny without being revelatory, the new season may represent a crossroads of sorts for Schumer: Can the former underdog strike the same rich comedic veins now that she's a star?"
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
Inside Amy Schumer,1,They're all funny and - even better than that - smart. Fans will be pleased. The hotness will only grow hotter.
RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars,0,The show has gone too far in its pursuit of turning queer art into a commodity. What business does the cast of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” Season 7 have at a stock exchange?
Westworld,1,"I have no idea what is going on, but now in the good, excited way that reminds me of seasons one and two rather than the listless, can’t-be-arsed way of season three. Which, I would say, is déjà vu to be welcomed. Fingers crossed."
Westworld,1,"It’s an absolute smorgasbord of thespian delights. Even at its most opaque, Westworld has always been worth watching just for those performances."
Westworld,1,"Westworld has returned in assured and brilliant style... Just when you think you have a handle on what’s happening, a big twist shows that you don’t."
Westworld,1,At least this feels a bit more like Westworld when it was actually good.
Westworld,1,"It has not lost its intelligence or quality. In many ways, this season is easier to follow than the last one, which suffered a bit from the usual symptoms of trying to expand a property beyond the source material."
Westworld,0,"Viewers who have come this far might not be able to resist sticking around for answers, but these are all teasers the show is posing about itself, from within its own impenetrable lore. Those big questions have shrunk from view."
Westworld,1,"Westworld may have shed a few of its I.Q. points over the years, but it's still a decent shoot-em-up that gives us women fighting back and winning."
Westworld,1,A meditative ride that keeps the synapses firing.
Westworld,0,"While there is surely intelligent life out there eager to see where this goes, at this point it's not so much a question of not being able to follow the series through its convoluted maze as simply not feeling as if it's worth the energy to try."
Westworld,1,"At this point, you sort of have to admire Westworld's resistance to crowd pleasing. We're so far beyond the lauded robot cowboy show at this point, I've swerved back around into begrudgingly respecting the Nolans' absurdly complicated narrative."
Westworld,1,"“Season 4 is a promising return to the dystopic, adults-only Magic Kingdom…”"
Westworld,1,"The show has earned a reputation for being too elaborate for its own good; at its core, though, Westworld is stubbornly simple. Four seasons in, it’s stopped trying to say anything new."
Westworld,1,One may miss the intriguing narrative loops and interior fugues of seasons one and two... But there is nonetheless shivery fun to be had as Westworld imagines what was probably the inevitable outcome of all this tinkering with synthetic thought.
Westworld,1,"Its capacity to fascinate us remains intact, especially as the themes which have always been lurking in the show become more present."
Westworld,1,"The most legible and the most fun Westworld has been in years. It’s still a mind game, but it no longer feels as if you’re playing against a computer."
Westworld,1,"The series still feels mysterious in a fun way and ominous in its themes and methods but this ""reset"" mode also has its drawbacks."
Westworld,0,"The new season of often wayward drama doesn’t just treat many of the people onscreen as NPCs. Withholding to a fault and placing a wearying emphasis on misdirection, it leaves viewers in the dark."
Westworld,1,"Westworld returns with a slow, somewhat vibrant, and irregular Season 4. It lacks a hook or an intrigue, which makes it a little less engaging than usual. [Full review in Spanish]"
Westworld,1,"Say what you will about Westworld, the show is unafraid to take risks and swing for the fences, and the rare moments it fully succeeds are more than enough to get me to plug back in."
Westworld,1,"Beautiful, baffling, and bonkers. A welcome resurgence for Joy and Nolan’s box of violent delights, and one that firmly dispels any hint that Westworld might have gone south."
Westworld,0,"It’s resolved to do what its done before to the best of its abilities, like a piece of A.I. tasked with replicating the human experience, but tapping out after it learns “excitement” and “deception.”"
Westworld,1,"It's hard to talk about Westworld's fourth season without fear of giving too much away, so I'll just say this: It's awesome."
Westworld,1,“Westworld” is essentially giving us the “The Matrix” sequel that we never got.
Westworld,1,"Westworld left the western theme park after Season 2, but continues to deepen the world in which that theme park could exist. Season 4 presents the most intriguing combination yet of Season 3's science-fiction and the themes of the first two seasons."
Westworld,1,"You may be wondering if you’ll need a refresher before tackling this new batch of episodes, but I was surprised at how easy to follow the show was — even if it had been more than two years since I last saw Maeve, Dolores and the destruction of Rehoboam."
Westworld,1,"Streamlining the storytelling surely helps the overall narrative, but this comes by sacrificing character nuance."
Westworld,0,"Will it all come together in a way that’s narratively sensible and emotionally satisfying? Fool me thrice, shame on me. Fool me four times, shame on Westworld."
Westworld,1,"Westworld Season 4 does the smart thing of offering just enough reveals without showing its full hand too early, feeding viewers little morsels of story while still gearing up for what has the potential to be a fine return to form."
Westworld,0,Westworld season 4 is ... a lot.
Westworld,1,The sinister quality of Westworld remains intact and there are gripping action sequences. Yet it’s hard to tell if the series is back on the rails as a vivid exploration of the power of myth and story.
Irma Vep,1,"With its virtues and flaws, Irma Vep is a worthy addition to the behind-the-scenes fiction canon, though it will never erase the memory of the original film. Thankfully. [Full review in Spanish]"
Irma Vep,1,"Stuffed with references to historical and contemporary film, Olivier Assayas’s miniseries version of his own 1996 film Irma Vep is sometimes too clever for its own good."
Irma Vep,1,"Nevertheless enjoyable for its superficial elements, mainly the beauty of its cast and locations..."
Irma Vep,1,"That key combination of Assayas, Vikander and all things Irma Vep is what dreams are made of, as is one of 2022's most glorious new TV shows."
Irma Vep,1,"The results aren’t pretty, even when they’re breathtaking; if there’s a more succinct critique of how everything from masterpieces to hot messes have been reduced to “content”... I have yet to see it."
Irma Vep,1,"Vikander’s performance is fantastically grounded, shifting from an “I need coffee” zombie walk out of her hotel to the cat-burglar elegance of Irma Vep in her black catsuit on the roofs of Paris, transforming sometimes in the space of a breath."
Irma Vep,1,"Not without some entertaining aspects. However, it just feels sort of stuck at this point. Nothing feels like it’s moving forward. Can something happen, please?"
Irma Vep,1,"At once delicious with plausible acrimony between egotists who are actually vulnerable people in real life, and sensitive to the vagaries of show business life, it has an unusual and very adult tone."
Irma Vep,1,The new Irma Vep may seem to be built solely for cinephiles. But it’s accessible and self-aware in how it giddily honors and skewers the modern entertainment industry.
Irma Vep,1,"It's all very clever and very much inside baseball, and there are times when it's almost exhausting keeping up with all the byzantine developments, but Irma Vep is worth the effort for its many moments of inspired lunacy."
Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep was already a deeply meta story. Adapting it into an HBO series starring Alicia Vikander risks losing the plot entirely—but as it turns out, the director still has plenty to say about Hollywood."
Irma Vep,1,"A beautifully observed satire on modern filmmaking, skewering the monolith of Hollywood superhero cinema and poking fun at the trappings of prestige TV."
Irma Vep,1,"Assayas delivers here a unique, pleasantly absorbing eight-part work that comments on itself and the very nature of filmmaking. It’s also a fun take on the collective quirks of putting anything together with a diverse group of people."
Irma Vep,1,"Mix Mira's immersion in the role with the other shenanigans happening on set, and we should get a pretty fun view of how the movie and TV sausage is made..."
Irma Vep,1,"... Slightly disappointing. Not because it's bad, but it falls short from what we've come to expect from Assayas. [Full review in Spanish]"
Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep is a quirky showbiz dramedy with some of the most deceptively smart writing on television, and that’s worth tuning in for."
Irma Vep,1,"It’s certainly a slow burn when it comes to plot, but if you love peeking into the world of making movies and TV, and atypical storytelling, Irma Vep is one to watch."
Irma Vep,1,"If “Irma Vep” ’96 is a quintessential Ship of Theseus... Vikander, through Mira, is an actress who can conjure a sea-ready vessel at will for whatever each new situation demands."
Irma Vep,1,Astute and metatextual... [Full review in Spanish]
Irma Vep,1,The series leans into the absurdity of trying to find creative and personal expression in an industry that in a perpetual state of reinvention.
Irma Vep,1,"[Assayas] hasn’t so much remade his earlier film as turned it inside out, expanding some ideas and collapsing others, inventing new characters and subplots, and adapting some of his earlier questions about art and obsession to our weird new age."
Irma Vep,1,Even better than the original.
Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep is a brilliant babushka doll of a show. Within each of its story layers lurks another, each more intricately detailed than the last."
Irma Vep,1,"What a viewer has to reconcile are the intentions of Mr. Assayas and his staggered construction: layers of interpersonal messiness, even emotional self-destruction, atop genuine artistic motivation and, maybe, accomplishment."
Irma Vep,1,"Like a lot of film school products, it's full of scathing wit and overheated erotic undertones and a little weak on narrative. And it's a lot of fun to watch, though the first person to announce ""what it means"" will get a hard slapping."
Irma Vep,1,"A smart, twisting look behind-the-scenes, and a reminder that Olivier Assayas is one of the best alive today in the filmmaking business, and apparently TV too."
Irma Vep,1,"Irma Vep takes a bit too long setting the table before getting to the meat of this adaptation, but once it gets going in the third episode, Assayas is crafting a remarkably personal and shockingly honest look at art and himself."
Irma Vep,1,No one does meta with more playfulness than Assayas.
Irma Vep,1,"For anyone who enjoys shows such as “Extras” and “Call My Agent” or movies including “Birdman,” “Irma Vep” is a welcome addition to the genre of the film and TV industry turning within itself."
Irma Vep,1,“Irma Vep” is a delightfully self-reflexive ode to the heartbreak of making and loving movies — or streaming television in the 2020s.
Irma Vep,1,"It’s become a cliché, the sort Assayas would pick on in one of his films, to say that good TV rewards patience, but this show really does. Among its pleasures is the work of Vikander, a clever and resourceful actor."
Irma Vep,1,Ridiculously bingeable and addictive.
Irma Vep,1,"It’s ostensibly about how film production all works, but it’s also quite funny, with its eclectic personalities fumbling through creating what they all hope will be a great work of art."
Irma Vep,1,"A cannily crafted, enjoyable and sometimes cheekily scabrous show that might nevertheless prove a super-niche proposition of most appeal to hardcore cinephile viewers."
Irma Vep,1,“Irma Vep” certainly leans into a more exclusive conversation about art — likely too elusive for mainstream audiences — but that lively discussion will be delectable for those in the know.
Irma Vep,1,"Everything is built around Vikander, in a role that makes expert use of the star’s ballet-trained physicality. There’s a palpable eroticism to her scenes with Arjona... but mostly the performance is just wonderfully light and open."
Barry,1,"Season three of Barry three slides into another stratosphere: it's that blisteringly clever, deeply layered, piercingly moving and terrifically acted."
Barry,1,"It just seems like we're quickly approaching a natural stopping point, though I happily acknowledge that Hader could find any number of pathways to explore."
Barry,1,"What makes Barry's third season so gripping isn't the plot, which is fairly similar to past seasons, but rather the way the show has levelled up in every other way."
Barry,1,"Given the moment of cultural backlash we’re living through, Barry feels eerily on the pulse. Always bleak, the supposed comedy is inching ever further into horror."
Barry,1,More corrosive (and lethal) than ever... [Full review in Spanish]
Barry,1,"“Barry” continues to be such a deceptively smart show about the human condition, while also being one of television’s funniest half hours. And the good news is that it picks up after a three-year hiatus as if no time has passed at all."
Barry,1,"It has always been a good show, but in its third season, Barry is beyond good...in turns hilarious and tragic. In an era where there is so much good television, there isn’t anything else quite like Barry."
Barry,1,Darker and smarter than ever. [Full review in Spanish]
Barry,1,"While previous seasons asked if it was possible to change, or if Barry is doomed to a life of violence, this season is firmly dealing with consequences."
Barry,1,Barry has always expertly balanced its tragicomedy demands so that even the funniest moments are laced with sadness while exploiting the absurd in the gloom. It’s a precarious tension but Hader and Berg have mastered it.
Barry,1,"This season is something close to a masterpiece in its meticulous set pieces and sun-washed cinematography, in its stunts and action sequences, and in deepening emotional stakes."
Barry,1,"The brilliant writing is what truly seals the deal here: no series is more adept at painting itself into a corner, and then blasting itself out with a jaw-dropping moment no-one could possibly see coming."
Barry,1,Barry is one of the tightest shows out there. Not a moment is wasted.
Barry,1,This season perfectly captures the mindset of being trapped in that zone between static existence and transition.
Barry,1,"Everyone in this world is weird, sad, and funny in their own unearthly way. As the lens pulls back, one thing becomes clear: Bill Hader and Alec Berg have created something brilliant, unlike anything weve seen before."
Barry,1,"Three years and a pandemic has done nothing to dull the edges of Barry or Bill Hader’s funny and sometimes frightening performance, and Winkler and the rest of the cast are still at the top of their games in the third season."
Barry,1,"Frankly, the averageness of all these people -- and all people -- is the crux of the show's sublime one-two punch of tragedy and giggles."
Barry,1,"Hader, believably shifting moods from catatonic to manic, makes Barry someone to fear and also, despite ourselves, to cheer. He belongs in the pantheon with Walter White and Dexter Morgan. Simply put, Barry slays me."
Barry,1,"Comedy lets Barry’s writers and performers deftly field all of these complex feelings, the fact that violence is abhorrent and yet compelling to watch, without feeling like it’s moralizing. Every squirm comes with an equally big laugh."
Barry,1,"Delving deeper into Hollywood's quirks and its title character's double life, the crackling third season continues to operate like a high-wire act without a net."
Barry,1,"Aside from these richly layered plot developments, the characterization and performances of Barry, Gene, Hank, and, above all Sally, help this hilarious and occasionally heart wrenching dramedy once again -- just like its title character -- hit the mark."
Barry,1,"Mostly, the season opens as a cautionary tale about getting what you wish for. Much like the story of The Monkeys Paw, or Stephen Kings Pet Sematary, the things you thought you wanted may not turn out to be what they seemed. They may be way, way worse."
Barry,1,This half-hour comedy is still one of television’s best suspense-filled thrillers.
Barry,1,"A master class on how to move a story forward without losing the spark that ignited it in the first place, keeping the tone without compromising substance. Full review in Spanish"
Barry,1,The series still has its trademark dark humor and self-deprecating inside Hollywood humility. The difference here is that all point points from previous seasons lead to a dark intensity while sacrificing a fair portion of comic relief.
Barry,1,"Season 3 is every bit as high-octane, uproarious, and unhinged as ever — and the dark part of this dark comedy is slowly closing in."
Barry,1,"The enthusiasm for acting which lit up Haders mobile features in the first two seasons is drained away. Hes now barely going through the motions of redemption. A show about faking it feels more fake, and therefore more true to itself than ever."
Barry,1,"The show still somehow manages to accomplish the Herculean feat of topping itself, zigging when most shows would zag and finding new, creative ways to make you laugh out loud."
Barry,1,"Barry more than justifies its existence as an ongoing series with a run of episodes that puts all of the show’s elements back in ridiculous, cruel harmony -- and in some cases go beyond anything Hader did in that immaculate first season."
Barry,1,"It’s so good this season that I not only want to recommend it to Vulture readers, I want to hand out flyers to random people on the street, imploring them to watch..."
Barry,1,"There's nothing on TV quite like Barry. The laughter is loud, but that makes the terrified silence more deafening."
Barry,1,"Even though we have waited three years for more episodes of Barry, it is absolutely worth it. While there are only eight episodes before we have to wait for more, these are the best chapters of this series yet."
Barry,1,"Barry is simply a masterpiece of deeply humane, hilarious satire."
Barry,1,"In Season 3, the comic drama gets as dark and morally knotty as Better Call Saul. Like Bob Odenkirk’s Saul, Hader’s Barry proves that an SNL funnyman can turn out to be one of the great dramatic actors on TV."
Barry,1,"Season 3 goes darker than this show every has before as it is unafraid to deep dive into PTSD, abuse, violence, humanity, and forgiveness. Filled with incredibly powerful performances by all involved, this is the best season yet."
Barry,1,"Among the many gifts Bill Hader delivers in this fabulous new chapter of his series is that, in picking off almost exactly where he left us, it feels almost as if the last two years never happened. How great is that?"
Barry,1,"Still strange, dark, harrowing and often — unexpectedly — very funny."
Barry,1,"After a nearly three-year absence, Barry returns darker and funnier than ever. Bill Hader’s reluctant hitman continues to find himself caught between a farce and horror, and the actor is a shoo-in for another Emmy nomination (and maybe win)."
Barry,1,"In its long-awaited third season, iBarryi is as assured and morosely hilarious as ever."
Barry,1,I care about so much of Barry that I don’t care about the things that I don’t care about.
Barry,1,"Every element works together seamlessly to deliver brisk, packed, profound, emotional, disturbing, and hilarious half-hour episodes that are so delectably perfect that it makes you feel sorry for every other show."
Barry,1,"In Season 3, the show has fully outgrown its cutesy premise to become one of TV's best thrill rides."
Barry,1,"Season three of Barry sees one of televisions most compelling, darkly comic series stepping back into the light with nary a beat skipped, finding new moral complications for its widening cast of characters without losing its offbeat sense of humor."
Barry,1,"The shocking originality of Hader's performance in the first season can't be replicated, of course, but he manages to maintain the quality of it throughout."
Barry,1,"It was good in its first two seasons and, I am pleased to report, it is still really good in its... third season. Maybe even better than ever."
Barry,1,"It’s one of the most meaningful, and complicated, uses of dark comedy on television. It’s also hard to tell whether the dark or the comedy will win in the end, but that’s what keeps us watching."
Barry,1,"A richer and deeper character study than “Barry” has previously been, and... a pleasing reward for fans who’ve waited nearly three years for more of this story."
Barry,1,"Where Barry or ""Barry"" goes next is an exciting, if trepidatious mystery. But both the man and the show are earning every step."
Barry,1,"This attention to detail — the performances, the direction, the awareness, the comedy, the sense of purpose — all come together to make “Barry” great."
Barry,1,"At times its almost unsettling to watch  and thats thanks in massive part to Bill Hader, who continues to deliver one of the most impressively versatile performances on television."
Barry,1,One of the best shows on TV is finally back.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Overall The Time Travelers Wife is funny and poignant in its best moments, but uncomfortable and cringe-worthy at its worst."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The romantic sci-fi drama barely justifies its existence...
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The show is buoyed by the charisma of the two lovers, and it succeeds in mining its conceit for some gentle humour and reflections on love and loss."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Seriously, this is once-in-a-decade bananas television."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Romance fluff with a hokey twist isn’t my cup of tea.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"If only time travel were real, they could use it to go back and do it right."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The bigger problem is that it’s all just a lot of time-traveling and dealing with the rigors of time-traveling. It’s mono-thematic.
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The show isn’t superb, but its romance and charming star make it far more watchable than the 2009 movie version with Rachel McAdams."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The series is never so engrossing that you forget about Clare and Henry’s interactions when she is a child. There is always that niggly feeling it’s not quite right, and the show doesn’t do enough to assuage that impression."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,A story that lacks strength... torn between what it wants to tell and how. [Full review in Spanish]
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The Time Traveler’s Wife should probably have been left in the past.
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"If the action scenes come across as a little jarring, that’s only because the quieter moments are by far the more impactful in Moffat’s smart, sensitive take."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Whether you are into romantic stories or not, this is an overall well-acted and executed series that makes great use of its six-episode run and redeems the novel that was beloved by so many fans."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Thinking ruins it in a very specific ways. Kick the mental tires too much on this genre romance, and the whole thing slides right into Skeeveyville."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,What’s left is a show filled with so much hatred and ickiness it’s hard to believe anyone will find something to enjoy lurking inside all this muck.
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The Time Traveler’s Wife does not have the power of the unexpected. But it has a modest, formulaic appeal that will likely keep you going back (and back) for more."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,[Moffat] takes the melodrama down a notch and salts the schmaltz with wit where he can.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The adaptation is so lazy that episodes begin with the lead characters reading lines straight into the camera, rather than anyone making the effort to work them into the script."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Leslie and James do their best to keep the series afloat, but it falls to pieces around them, slowly but surely."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Hollow characters, an uncertain tone and, most damningly, a total lack of chemistry keep The Time Traveler’s Wife from ever quite rising to the level of swoon-worthy."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Some books really might be unadaptable.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"I think the most off-putting thing about The Time Traveler’s Wife, right from the jump, is how strangely chintzy and thin it looks."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The two leads of The Time Traveler's Wife do their best to make complex moments of humanity crack through the wild hook, and Steven Moffat's deeper dive into the story via limited series offers up some moments, both funny and dramatic, that work."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It's an admirable effort, but one that simply underscores how unadaptable this material might be -- the bottom line being that if time is indeed precious, these six episodes finally feel too much like a waste of it."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The real star of this woeful, pointless television programme is its toxic gender and sexual politics."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler’s Wife is so unsatisfying, it’s a bit baffling why anybody, let alone Steven Moffat, whose work as a writer and showrunner includes Doctor Who and Sherlock, decided to have a go at it."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"It’s just a shame that The Time Traveler’s Wife sometimes feels, like its hero, as if it’s being pulled in a hundred different directions at once."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Every time it feels as though the show might actually want to have a real conversation about fate, free will, or consequences, it slides away from the implication without ever fully looking it in the face."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"The six-episode first season delivers a welcome fairytale with a “Pushing Daisies” vibe, but with such a tight initial focus on just these two characters, one wonders if it can go the distance."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Cynics won’t be able to stomach any of it, but the rest of us will gladly embrace the feels and tears."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Bad wigs, limp characterization, indifferent plotting."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Let’s just hope “The Time Traveler’s Wife” never visits again in any other screen adaptation.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Even if you don’t know the story of The Time Traveler’s Wife, it’s still a fun watch and one that is woven into Moffat’s other work. And who doesn’t want to see Theo James and Rose Leslie falling in love with each other out of order?"
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"That defining notion of object impermanence is what renders Henry and Clare's journey through time — and the series as a whole — all the more riveting, making it easy for us to be swept up in the story even if it only lasts for a short while."
The Time Traveler's Wife,1,"Rose Leslie, though, is the beating heart of the series, tenderly conveying the romantic aches and emotional pains of a woman who must always wait for her partner to return, someday."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Somewhere in here is a layered examination of the way people orient themselves around another that prods at how power fits into romantic relationships, but that story was too hard to tell/"
We Own This City,1,"Director Reinaldo Marcus Green... demonstrates his expertise in balancing action with multiple characters’ complexity including revealing reaction shots. As the catalyst Jenks, Jon Bernthal delivers a fierce and fiery performance."
We Own This City,1,"We Own This City is David Simon at his very best, and confirms him as a screenwriter of generational importance."
We Own This City,0,"We Own wanted to be a thundering state-of-the-nation address on race and policing, but forgot that it also had to be interesting."
We Own This City,1,"Simon is unafraid of giving a stark, honest overview of the genuine difficulties inherent in politicised policing, when every arrest takes place in the shadow of a smartphone."
We Own This City,1,"Simon, creator of The Wire, returns to Baltimore... to piece together the fragments of a broken city and turn them into an exquisite televisual mosaic."
We Own This City,1,"This is a dense, downbeat show that doesn’t make any concessions to the viewer. Sometimes it feels like a civics lesson... Try it if you feel strong enough."
We Own This City,1,We Own This City is packed with fantastic dialogue and excellent performances.
We Own This City,1,"More of an epilogue to The Wire than a spiritual sequel, David Simon’s return to Baltimore is another intelligently crafted, angry treatise on America’s fatally flawed institutions."
We Own This City,1,"This horrifying story will more than reward you, once you tune in to its beat."
We Own This City,1,"The subject matter is dramatically engaging, but the confines of a six-episode series do the show no favours."
We Own This City,1,"Highly, heavily recommended."
We Own This City,1,"The story of Jenkins, his colleague/accomplices, and the scandal surrounding them is a complex one, and is told here in detail... But they’re not just interested in facts – they want to convey the feeling of committing these crimes..."
We Own This City,1,"If the worst thing we could say about this show is that it's like another season of The Wire, that's not too bad."
We Own This City,1,"It simply has the power of good entertainment, abounding with ideas and charm, taking the audience to a place where’s there’s room for wit, horror and acknowledgment of pain."
We Own This City,0,"With its pressing social issues and weighty mystery, We Own This City desperately wants to be The Wire and True Detective, but lacks the narrative panache to match the unbelievable twists and turns of the headlines the story is ripped from."
We Own This City,1,"What distinguishes the show from The Wire is its grounding in a contemporary law-enforcement milieu that is reacting, in ways both constructive and destructive, to the Black Lives Matter movement."
We Own This City,1,"Not a light watch, We Own This City is show that demands your attention, King Richard director Reinaldo Marcus Green doing a great job of corralling the sometimes sprawling story into compelling, riveting viewing."
We Own This City,1,"While it doesnt grab and command the way ""The Wire"" did week after week, this similar-themed series from David Simon is nonetheless well-worth bookmarking."
We Own This City,1,"Sparked by a jittery live-wire performance from Jon Bernthal and anchored by incredibly smart dialogue, We Own This City is a stand-out mini-series in one of the most crowded periods of 'Prestige Drama' in years."
We Own This City,1,"Here [Jon Bernthal] spreads a pair of monstrous wings, completely claiming the screen for himself. All the awards will surely be his."
We Own This City,1,"As watchably infuriating as We Own This City can be, it occasionally suffers from loyalty to its true story. Good police work happens interrogation by interrogation, which isn’t necessarily the pace of electric TV."
We Own This City,1,We Own This City sports an intriguing non-linear structure that initially seems haphazard but quickly reveals itself to be thematically compelling.
We Own This City,1,"The truth of it all is infuriating and illuminating. But there was a time when Simon and Pelicanos found electrifying ways to show it, instead of tell it."
We Own This City,1,You'll never watch another cop show the same way again.
We Own This City,1,"A vivid, richly detailed series, shot with gritty intimacy by director Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard) and worth watching for a host of reasons."
We Own This City,1,"It tells a necessary story about corruption within our most cherished and essential systems, and laments how long we allowed it to continue, and how many people we allowed it to hurt."
We Own This City,1,"We Own This City is dense, difficult, and altogether rewarding for its look into what is wrong and right about being a police officer in America."
We Own This City,1,"If you're a fan of The Wire (as I am) and consider that David Simon series the best TV show ever, then you will love HBO's We Love This City."
We Own This City,1,Viewers who aren’t already familiar with the GTTF scandal are in for a harrowing account of police criminality. It’s the kind of flabbergasting tale that makes you wonder how many others like it are still out there.
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
We Own This City,1,"By the shows final moments, may of its flaws recede into the general impression of hard-hitting dramatization of real-life events. There is much to admire in the effort."
We Own This City,1,Test 042522
We Own This City,1,"The project feels a little messy in the early going, but the pieces come together in a compelling way, illustrating the deep roots of police excesses and the elusiveness of the political will to achieve genuine solutions."
We Own This City,1,"More than anything, “City” plays like an excruciating tragedy... But it’s stunningly executed all the same."
We Own This City,1,"Provocative, powerful, and with first-rate performances, We Own This City is the next generation of The Wire fans have long craved."
We Own This City,1,"Even at its weakest moments, We Own This City rivals anything currently on TV because of the singular talents driving this series. Still, given the startling subject matter and Simon’s track record, the series’ highs should be more consistent."
We Own This City,1,"A brilliant piece of work, also profoundly dispiriting."
We Own This City,1,"If youre willing to risk watching a show made for adult consumption about pressing, complicated questions, however, you will feel rewarded. The show will remain with you long after your initial viewing in a way few shows do."
We Own This City,1,"A very good show, with granular realism, a sly sense of humor and fine acting top to bottom."
We Own This City,1,"It’s easy to keep pace with We Own This City, even as it’s difficult to fathom the breadth of police corruption outlined here—even though we know all of this really happened."
We Own This City,0,"The shows talented cast and shocking plot compel, but its dry factual narrative and blind-spot-heavy examination of policing make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience."
We Own This City,1,"We Own This City is rooted in the energy and style of The Wire but with a story from the recent past that rings especially true in our current societal state. In short, We Own This City is a masterpiece."
We Own This City,1,An Uncompromising And Grim Look At The Modern American Police.
We Own This City,1,"As it slowly threads its many storylines together, We Own This City paints a dire if necessary portrait of a city and a law enforcement agency."
We Own This City,1,"If nothing else, We Own This City is a cattle prod to the cerebellum, reminding us of how much further we still have to go to achieve justice in America."
We Own This City,1,"Even while it’s about a dysfunctional institution, We Own This City is also about the individuals we meet along the way to the courtroom. The characters are riveting, some for their arrogance and cruelty and others for their weakness."
We Own This City,1,"Serious and sobering, the six-episode limited series We Own This City delivers a worthy and worthwhile follow-up to The Wire."
We Own This City,1,An American pressure cooker that depicts what ails America’s law enforcement system and society at large.
We Own This City,1,"Because the actors are so good, and because Simon, Pelecanos, Burns, and company have been making Eat Your Vegetables TV for two decades and counting, We Own This City is almost always extremely watchable."
We Own This City,1,There isn’t a bad performance in We Own This City — a real achievement in a cast this big — and Simon and Pelecanos’ indignation feels consistently earned and documented at every level.
We Own This City,1,"From the jump, We Own This City is about the underhandedness of saying something with a smile while pressing a knife into someone elses back; it is about choices, dirty choices, and voluntary ones at that."
We Own This City,1,"To the extent it can, We Own This City shows the excesses of the GTTF while also taking time to consider the downstream effects of the lives it left in its wake. All of these actions have consequences, even after decades of self-justification."
Game of Thrones,1,"After George RR Martin's books ended, the show's mojo seemed to follow. It may have still constituted event TV, but in retrospect that was based on the strength of the fan community and massive marketing more than the material itself."
Game of Thrones,0,"SHOCKING things happened just because they had shock value. They bore no connection to anything else that had happened before them. There was hardly any organic, believable storytelling leading up to those moments. Thus, they felt shallow."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight can be summed up in a phrase - missed opportunities.
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 reduced characters to caricatures, didn't earn its character development and the shift in their arcs, baked in several plot holes, and did away with internal logic and consistency."
Game of Thrones,1,There is something courageous about a television series that is brave enough to reimagine Richard III as a hero.
Game of Thrones,1,"Some are saying we'll never have TV like Game of Thrones again, but that simply isn't true - it worked, so of course it will be emulated."
Game of Thrones,0,"Game of Thrones finally finished, the last episode aptly titled The Long Night and it was a terrible ending, disappointing for fans, causing a collective cringe around the globe."
Game of Thrones,1,"Together, this team made an unimaginably huge mountain out of an unfinished book series. It's okay to be glad that it's over, but let's not forget how great it was when it was on its game."
Game of Thrones,0,"The current, final season of HBO's Game of Thrones is swinging and missing on both fronts (the production quality and writing) as a hurried journey toward the finish line is ultimately hurting the series and possibly its legacy."
Game of Thrones,0,"In the final six episodes, Game of Thrones should have felt like a game of chess. Instead, it veered very close to feeling more like a game of checkers. And that's probably why so many viewers felt burned."
Game of Thrones,0,"It's such a fundamental shift of priorities that, for all of season 8's technical virtues and the sound resolution of a few story beats, it still can't help but feel like a betrayal of the show's ethos"
Game of Thrones,1,It was a fitting end to the story.
Game of Thrones,1,"Even at its wobbliest, these final episodes demonstrate a stunning degree of filmmaking skill that find even the weakest installments standing head and shoulders over most recent feature films of a similar nature."
Game of Thrones,1,"Game of Thrones found purpose. Not to press our faces to the fire, but to show us those already burned, and teach us how to hold their suffering."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight made the regrettable mistake of giving half its time to an underwhelming villain at the expense of the characters who made the show special in the first place.
Game of Thrones,0,Daenerys and Cersei are portrayed as too ambitious and emotionally unfit to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
Game of Thrones,1,"If only [David] Benioff and [DB] Weiss had had more faith in these quiet moments. Instead, they tried to load as many epic battles and as much incredible CGI into the final season as they could."
Game of Thrones,1,"Season 8 is the weakest, but it's still good. It's just ""Good"" in amongst a series that constantly hit ""Excellent"" makes it really stand out..."
Game of Thrones,0,"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 doesn't feel like it was earned, with too little time dedicated to growing characters paired with a greater emphasis on rushing to major plot points, rather than proving to those of us watching how inevitable they were."
Game of Thrones,0,"I don't think anyone can be happy that this season focused, in the end, on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character on an ensemble full of brutal instincts and grasping ambition."
Game of Thrones,1,"This concluding season may not live up to its promise, but it finds a sense of peace for its survivors."
Hacks,1,"The brilliantly biting Smart continues to turn in awards-worthy work in Hacks' second season, and Einbinder still wears Ava's entitled chaos like a second skin."
Hacks,1,"Fortunately for Hacks, the comedy does give some of the other supporting cast members more to do..."
Hacks,1,Jean Smart rules. I realize that this is not exactly a newsflash.
Hacks,1,Hacks stands out in the TV comedy landscape because doesn’t gloss over or shy away from the ugliest parts of its characters. Women are complicated.
Hacks,1,This is about as good as a season finale gets.
Hacks,1,"If good comedy needs emotional heft, this has it to spare, and still manages to be vicious at the same time."
Hacks,1,"Guest star Harriet Sansom Harris is warm and wonderful as the defeated comic; equally brilliant is Laurie Metcalf, all arms and lip, playing commander of the schedule and the coach."
Hacks,1,"The lack of epiphanies, life lessons, and intergenerational bonding is what makes the second season work so well. The show isn’t following the trajectory of other comedies that have forced their characters to hit the road."
Hacks,1,"Ava and Deborah are the ultimate dysfunctional couple, bound together by their working relationship but also by the fact that looking at each other is like looking in a mirror, letting them see the worst parts of themselves reflected back."
Hacks,1,"A remarkably smart comedy, one that understands human behavior and how it’s warped by show business."
Hacks,1,Hacks returns for its second season on HBO Max and reminds viewers right out of the gate what makes the show so simultaneously enjoyable and anxiety-inducing.
Hacks,1,Much more comfortable with its ensemble and storytelling.
Hacks,1,"Both Deborah and the show as a whole return in wonderfully acerbic form, with supporting characters providing great value."
Hacks,1,"While slightly less edgy and fierce than the first season, “Hacks” Season 2 really starts to find its footing again in the second half of the season – reminding us what a great combo Smart and Einbinder are"
Hacks,1,"Season 2 of Hacks is messier, less focused, and more chaotic."
Hacks,1,Hacks works this season because...for Deborah...it's all on the line.
Hacks,1,"Hacks is a sincere story about cynical people, which is a delicate balance to strike without betraying its characters."
Hacks,1,"Showrunners Paul W. Downs, Jen Statsky and Lucia Aniello deserve much of the credit for steering the comedy right on that line between droll and devastating, but none of their efforts would land if Smart and Einbinder weren't such a phenomenal team."
Hacks,1,"What we have now is a fun-filled resurrection story with razor-sharp wit and even more of the fraught drama about youth and age, experience, naiveté and regret."
Hacks,1,"Reconfirms itself as one of the best comedies available. Brilliant, fun, and deliciously chaotic. [Full review in Spanish]"
Hacks,1,Season 2 remains interested in the storylines of all these fantastic characters.
Hacks,1,Season 2 of Hacks is a comedy buffet of comedic talents and surprisingly emotional moments.
Hacks,1,"Polish up another Emmy for Jean Smart who's funnier, fiercer and deeper in her second season as a Vegas stand-up diva on a road tour with a young writer (Hannah Einbinder) she loves to torture as they dish out mirth and malice no other sitcom can match."
Hacks,1,"Smart carried the show’s first season with her slippery charisma, coiled-and-ready-to-strike pain and delightfully unpredictable line readings. It’s a joy to see the rest of the series catch up with her munificent excellence in its sophomore year."
Hacks,1,The pleasure of watching Hacks is in the way the show explores how a person might be pushed to change by someone who hates them just as much as they might be by someone they love.
Hacks,1,Still fun to watch but also not quite working at the level its fans have come to expect.
Hacks,1,"Hacks in Season 2 has lost none of its acerbic charm, and Ms. Smart has lost none of her edge."
Hacks,1,"The successes on season two of Hacks are hard won by the series’ characters who maneuver around a minefield of losses. The message of perseverance and determination, however, is sent with aplomb and without a shred of “hack”-y-ness."
Hacks,1,"The stakes are higher, the comedy is sharper, and the drama at the heart of Ava and Deborah’s thorny relationship is even more engrossing."
Hacks,1,Hacks is effortlessly good TV.
Hacks,1,Hacks remains in top form as comic Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and her young writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder) hit the road as the secret of Ava's betrayal simmers in the background.
Hacks,1,"Elegantly demonstrates how to avoid pitfalls of a second season, expanding relationships between characters without changing personalities...whether it's using new locations or confronting them with their past or personal demons. Full review in Spanish."
Hacks,1,"“Hacks” remains one of the most consummately funny shows on TV, defying the sophomore slump to uncover ever more trenchant truths about ambition, failure, and the blurring line between work and family."
Hacks,1,If the thrill of devouring Hacks’ first season can’t be fully replicated here -- and that’d be a high bar for any show that was so assured and exciting right out the gate -- it’s refreshing to see it still strike the right balance of humor and heart.
Hacks,1,"It’s a pretty impressive threading of the needle. If anything, Season Two leans even more into the series’ strengths."
Hacks,1,"A more self-assured show, even if its characters have never been less sure of themselves."
Hacks,1,"As with the first season, the ice-cold, fire-warm heart and soul of Hacks lies in the relationship between Deborah and Ava."
Hacks,1,"There are plenty of little reasons why the second season of Hacks doesn’t take a leap from very good-ness to greatness, but plenty of big reasons why that isn’t really a problem."
Hacks,1,"Having already established the story and the characters, our reunion with the veteran standup and her protegee runs deeper, funnier and is as curious and it is self-assured."
Hacks,1,"There are jokes this season that will have you howling and plot developments that will get you screaming... Through it all, Jean Smart continues to reign supreme."
Hacks,1,"Having laid the groundwork for Deborah and Ava to become actual friends, Hacks is free to delve into more internal sources of conflict, which in turn gives Smart and Einbinder a chance to stretch the bounds of their already elastic performances."
Hacks,1,"These characters are well-established and enjoyable enough that it’s fun to simply hit the road with Deborah, Ava, and Marcus."
Hacks,1,"Although there is still a real pleasure in seeing an actress as accomplished as Jean Smart getting a meaty role, this latest season of “Hacks” does not live up to the bar set by its superior debut season."
Hacks,1,Set your worries aside because Hacks has done it again. Season 2 leans into its established strengths while recognizing new opportunities.
Hacks,1,While Season 1 saw this modern-day odd couple struggling to find common ground... Season 2 finds an even more compelling way to heighten this will-they-won’t-they-make-it-work dramatic tension.
Hacks,1,The six episodes made available for review deliver another superb showcase for Smart and Einbinder while also providing the standout-packed ensemble amplified opportunities to shine.
Hacks,1,"While Hacks Season 2 struggles a bit to keep those plates in the air at first, it's still as cutting and engaging as ever, building steam throughout."
The Staircase,1,"If you’re familiar with the case and you’ve seen the original documentary, there’s not much new to glean. But the fresh perspective and the performances are more than enough to justify its existence."
The Staircase,1,"With spectacular performances and a new perspective, The Staircase is a compelling retelling of already known events."
The Staircase,1,The ambiguity in this powerful enigma surrounding the high-profile case that inspired two series - documentary and fiction - is a key element in keeping us hooked from the beginning to the end. [Full review in Spanish]
The Staircase,0,"True crime is not something to be toyed with, and The Staircase, for all the beautiful work put into it, toys with viewers instead of finding the salient truths about the case."
The Staircase,1,The Staircase makes tantalizing equivalences between the filmmaking process and the justice system.
The Staircase,1,"Startling and compelling, this true crime miniseries wrings new juice from a well-worn criminal case with deft and involving characterizations from a powerhouse cast."
The Staircase,0,"In The Staircase Mark Two, highly complex events are revealed in flashbacks so numerous that no momentum is ever able to build. Just as a scene starts getting interesting, we're whipped back to a different year altogether."
The Staircase,1,"This version of the Staircase is riveting and brilliantly acted from start to finish. And if you haven't watched the docuseries, you can approach the material from a fresh, unbiased angle."
The Staircase,1,"Also starring Michael Stuhlberg, Juliette Binoche and Rosemarie DeWitt, this is a fascinating portrait of grief and perspectives as well as an intriguing whodunit."
The Staircase,1,The Staircase gave us eight episodes of scintillating true-crime drama. It also turned wig acting into a competitive sport.
The Staircase,1,"Without belaboring the point, let me just say that this new, dramatized version of the story is very well made, and includes a terrific performance by Parker Posey as Peterson’s priggish prosecuting attorney."
The Staircase,1,A masterfully composed and tonally strong drama that captures the same unsettling vibe which bewitched fans of the docuseries.
The Staircase,1,"Perfect material worth binging.
[Full review in Spanish]"
The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth, who has played gay numerous times before, has never been so simultaneously sexy and scary."
The Staircase,1,"True crime has come a long way from the cheap, lurid days of America’s Most Wanted. The Staircase, starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette, has the posh cast and opulent production values that showcase the genre’s evolution."
The Staircase,1,"As Kathleen, a high-flying executive who appears to be falling out of love with her husband, Toni Collette gives convincing voice to a woman who was little more than a series of gruesome forensic photographs in the doc."
The Staircase,1,A batch of powerful performances help to lend this fantastical tale plenty of dramatic gravitas.
The Staircase,1,"Though the documentary about the case, also called The Staircase, is also addictively good, the Firth version is even better."
The Staircase,1,"Intriguing, absorbing, raw, and fascinating… One of the best true crime miniseries we’ll see this year. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Staircase,1,"There’s much that’s dark and even grisly in The Staircase, but it is more ambitious and textured than most crime dramas, owing to the high bar set by de Lestrade’s documentary, a landmark legal thriller."
The Staircase,0,"Yep, television has officially eaten itself."
The Staircase,1,"A true genre exercise with a narrative that escapes the temptation of sensationalism, yellow journalism, and morbidity."
The Staircase,1,"Under the direction of creator Antonio Campos, “The Staircase” is a richer portrait of unbalanced psyches entangled in a web of multiple schemes."
The Staircase,1,This nonlinear reexamination is as much about a possible murder as it is society’s insidious fascination with horrible tragedies.
The Staircase,1,"What if we asked instead why we form such intense attachments to people we can never truly know, or how a medium influences its message? They're issues that apply well beyond a single case..."
The Staircase,1,"Michael and Kathleen are played by Colin Firth and Toni Collette, respectively, two well-distinguished actors who shine brightly and play well off of each other."
The Staircase,1,There's a lot to like about this series.
The Staircase,1,"As a whole, The Staircase is a worthwhile watch, mainly for the performances by Firth, Posey and Collette. But you might get more satisfying information about the Peterson case by watching the documentary or docuseries."
The Staircase,1,The Staircase winds up being a meta-text more than a murder mystery --and it’s a riveting one.
The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth plays Michael Peterson and does it with a rare kind of skill. If you think the case has been mined enough already, your mind is changed by Firth’s extraordinary subtlety as a man of many secrets and delusions."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase... defies expectations, adding new perspective and dimension to a well-known story while creating an experience that differs from the docuseries."
The Staircase,1,"Colin Firth burns with intensity in this true-crime series that keeps you guessing if a bisexual novelist, politician, former marine and frequent liar pushed his wife (Toni Collette) to her death down the family staircase or whether she fell by accident."
The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase (in all its iterations) embodies exploitative true crime trashiness, then I am its garbage disposal..."
The Staircase,1,"If you didn’t know it was true, you wouldn’t believe it."
The Staircase,1,"Despite the series’ predictability, the rabbit-hole appeal of the original story should keep plenty of viewers watching."
The Staircase,1,The drama is compelling for the same reason the documentary was compelling...
The Staircase,1,"As Michael Peterson, Colin Firth manages to make us think he’s guilty as hell one minute, and possibly innocent the next. Toni Collette is touching as Kathleen."
The Staircase,1,"Although there are still moments of something that skews uncomfortably close to fandom, revelations about the making of The Staircase cast everything that came before in a new light."
The Staircase,1,"In this well-written series, Firth expertly plays a duplicitous man whose discovery of his wife’s body casts suspicion on him and divides his family."
The Staircase,1,"While the episodes occasionally grind too slowly, Colin Firth's riveting work as the hard-to-read suspect elevates this HBO Max limited series several steps above standard true-crime fare."
The Staircase,1,"[Colin] Firth plays [Michael] with aplomb, but [Toni] Collette’s portrayal of Kathleen truly shines."
The Staircase,1,One might accuse the show of trying to have it both ways -- decrying our media culture of rapacious violence while indulging in it -- if both halves weren’t so carefully made and so probingly curious.
The Staircase,1,"It’s also a reminder of the genius of Colin Firth, who, as Michael Peterson, is at the center of the show and holds it expertly. It’s a cliché to say that an actor disappears into his role, but there it is"
The Staircase,1,"It’s a pro job. But if you’re interested in the facts behind the fact-based fiction, there is little new to learn."
The Staircase,1,"Led by an excellent Colin Firth, The Staircase is telly at its best."
The Staircase,1,"In the end, its pleasures are rather cerebral, less a whodunit than a story about telling stories — and the omissions in hopeful service of a greater truth."
The Staircase,1,"Don’t be afraid of this dramatization of your baby, true crime fans. The Staircase is in good hands."
The Staircase,1,"The smartest aspect of ""Staircase"" is that Campos makes the original documentary a part of its plot."
The Staircase,1,"The whole show revolves around Firth, who hasn't been this good since the film A Single Man."
The Staircase,1,"Mr. Firth and Ms. Collette, as the loving couple who may have hated each other, are playing complex characters with Emmy-worthy aplomb."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is both a masterful moment for an assured filmmaker, and it's the jolt that the true crime storytelling industry needs."
The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama."
The Staircase,1,"Though this drama tries and fails to reach the same heights as its predecessor, it nevertheless makes for gripping viewing."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is intensely concerned with not just the mystery at hand, but with the mystery of all people, maybe all of life. Campos, who directed six episodes and ran the show with Maggie Cohn, fills the series with small and tantalizing detail."
The Staircase,1,"It's not often that a dramatization of something that people already know about is told in such a nuanced way, but there truly is something for everyone here."
The Staircase,1,"While it may not break any new ground in terms of style or content, it is an absolutely engaging series that will hold your interest and showcases a central performance by Firth that reminds us he is still one of the most capable actors working today."
The Staircase,1,"It speaks well for the show that even after having watched this story for 13 unscripted hours, I still have plenty left I want to see here."
The Staircase,1,"The cast here isn’t just uniformly excellent; it functions as a single organism, bending and breaking as a unit, from the stars to the bit players."
The Staircase,1,"You may know how everything turns out. You may not. Either way, the truth is so elusive here, and ""The Staircase"" so expertly made, you'll be hooked."
The Staircase,0,"Campos brings visual panache to the project, but can never quite surmount the old aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction."
The Staircase,1,"Even as close as the documentary came in its pursuit of real answers, The Staircase doesn't offer much clarity beyond that, with no obvious answer amidst a legion of inscrutable mysteries that may never be unraveled."
The Staircase,1,"It’s full of tricky, complicated ambiguities that are often riveting and sometimes just baffling... This is a series that seems to admit that a lot of true crime, or at least this one, is really a no-win slow descent into a tragic morass."
The Staircase,1,"The linchpin of this delicate portrayal is Colin Firth’s performance as Michael. Best known for playing romantic leads and other charismatic types, he disappears, here, into a far murkier character."
The Staircase,1,"It’s more than a “did he do it?” mystery; it’s an indictment of the vagaries of the criminal justice system, the narcissism of abusive men, and most of all, through Collette, it gives Kathleen some much-needed humanity."
The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the focus of future chapters will be tighter, but as far as the premiere episodes are concerned, youd be better off watching the documentary series first, before chasing it with Firths acting masterclass."
The Staircase,1,Colin Firth And Toni Collette Are Equally Strong In This Expansion Of The True Crime Saga.
The Staircase,1,"An intriguing and captivating miniseries that dives deeper than the documentary did. Twists and surprises are around every corner for those who don't know the story, but those who do will enjoy it as well."
The Flight Attendant,1,Cuoco’s Cassie remains a magnetic heroine forever on the precipice of calamity.
The Flight Attendant,1,"Ultimately, it makes for a much less successful second season, but the first season of Flight Attendant was so good that there was plenty of room to fall."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The first season was overstated, but this takes things to another level entirely."
The Flight Attendant,1,"It's a great premise, but it has lost a little bit of its spark."
The Flight Attendant,1,This zesty screwball thriller zips along at supersonic speed.
The Flight Attendant,1,Kaley Cuoco is a whole new Cassie as spy antics lead to perplexing mystery...
The Flight Attendant,1,I’m here to watch the ship go down in flames with popcorn and a Cassie-approved soda with lime.
The Flight Attendant,1,"Season two of “The Flight Attendant” doesn’t mix things up much from its first season. While fans will delight that all the twists and turns are back, it’s hard to believe that Cassie never learned her lesson following her season one brush with death."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The story is streamlined to focus more on Cassies personal development. This might turn off those who enjoyed what Season 1 laid out, but if youve enjoyed the characters this far youll continue to love Cuoco and company as they try to become adults."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The first season of HBO Maxs The Flight Attendant was a harrowing, brutal exploration of trauma and addiction. Season two, in contrast, after two episodes, is a zany spy comedy."
The Flight Attendant,1,"From the Saul Bass/Bond-esque animated opening titles to the regular use of split-screens, there’s still a swagger about Flight Attendant that disarms the viewer and draws you into Cassie’s world."
The Flight Attendant,1,"It’s funny, it’s dark, it’s intriguing, and it’s sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I could not recommend this show enough."
The Flight Attendant,1,The Flight Attendant still weaves humor and heartbreak into some pretty solid spy stuff.
The Flight Attendant,1,"There's no denying the soaring pleasure of The Flight Attendant despite these minor irritations even so, because Cuoco is simply that good at captaining our way through Cassie's muchness."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The result is a less tight whodunnit, but something that remains at its best when Cassie is complicating her own life, doubling down on mistakes while struggling to convince herself and everyone around her that she’s simply cruising."
The Flight Attendant,1,The HBO Max comedy thriller is still sexy and fun. It’s also shockingly poignant about a harsh truth: It might actually be impossible to become a better version of yourself.
The Flight Attendant,1,"The end result is that a show like this can come back and be satisfying, again and again, without either gambling on a cliffhanger or having to start entirely from scratch."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The second season shifts things, but never loses sight of the vital fun factor; Cuoco continues to be tremendously good as a physical presence."
The Flight Attendant,1,"As odd and morbid as the plotting sounds, “The Flight Attendant” is driven by pure comedic edge. We root for Cassie even as we shake our collective heads as viewers."
The Flight Attendant,1,"Whether or not it ultimately achieves another smooth landing, it’s fun to see the show return to dizzying heights."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The Flight Attendant follows up its excellent first season with a promising story for Cassie in season 2. Either way, we’ll be watching to see what aspects of Cuoco’s skill set she’ll display this season."
The Flight Attendant,1,"What this season excels at is Cuoco’s character work as Cassie -- not only as all the alternate versions of her in the mind palace, but also as the real-world version of her, who’s working through her trauma, addiction, and self-sabotaging tendencies."
The Flight Attendant,0,"While everything was new to Cassie the first time around -- making her a sort of classic Hitchcockian Everywoman, way over her head in this world of espionage -- the mystery here proves more convoluted and difficult to track."
The Flight Attendant,1,The right choice was made in extending this series’ stay.
The Flight Attendant,0,"The writing is an insult to the acting caliber of all involved, especially the usually wonderful Zosia Mamet and new cast member Shohreh Aghdashloo."
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
The Flight Attendant,1,"It’s still a delicious mix of pulse-pounding thrills, razor-sharp comedy and surprisingly meaty psychological drama."
The Flight Attendant,1,"Diving into the second season, though, provides a forceful reminder of just how good this show is at getting you inside the head of someone constantly on the edge of a panic attack."
The Flight Attendant,1,The way Cuoco is able to calibrate her performance to perform with herself is nothing short of amazing.
The Flight Attendant,1,"The comedy is still there, as are some cringe-inducing moments and head-scratching decisions, but there is also a more serious, introspective tone to the new episodes."
The Flight Attendant,1,Was a second season necessary? No. But it makes for a very good time.
The Flight Attendant,1,The second season of the series keeps its characters constantly on the go even as they face down their demons.
The Flight Attendant,1,"Cuoco, who was nominated for an Emmy for her performance last season, is gunning for a win this time around, and it’s hard to mind..."
The Flight Attendant,1,One of the pleasures of watching this show is to see the inside of peoples houses and hotel rooms but also to enjoy Cassies sense of style as a somewhat low-key Carrie Bradshaw.
The Flight Attendant,1,"Enjoyment will largely depend on which version of the series you prefer: the one about Cassie’s personal journey or the one in which she’s an inept spy. If it’s the former, you’re in for a treat."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The darkly comedic spy thriller continues to excel, with an excellent Kaley Cuoco at its center."
The Flight Attendant,1,"What’s great about The Flight Attendant is that it’s airy fun but it’s also well-plotted with an eye toward satisfying viewers. Many characters from season one pop in, often in the most unexpected moments, and it’s a delight."
The Flight Attendant,1,"Kaley Cuoco Shines In An Enticing, But Uneven Attempt To Recapture Previous Heights."
The Flight Attendant,1,"Cassie is a woman constantly on the brink, and the way Cuoco can easily maneuver between the comedy and the darkness that still haunts her character buoys the show."
The Flight Attendant,1,One element thats consistent (if not improved upon) from season one is Cassies inner turmoil as she struggles towards sobriety and deals with working through her childhood with an alcoholic father.
The Flight Attendant,1,"The Flight Attendant continues what we’re used to from the show, but it also subverts the very subversive expectations laid out in the first season."
The Flight Attendant,1,"The investment in the characters, plus the fun globe-trotting action should keep viewers riveted."
The Flight Attendant,1,It’s hard to give Cuoco enough praise for what she does on screen this season.
The Flight Attendant,1,"While The Flight Attendant's first season had Bohjalian's book to work from, Season 2 aims to move past that completed story arc and away from the source material, but only to varyingly rewarding returns..."
The Flight Attendant,1,"This season has more twists, turns, surprises, and thrills than the first. Its the ultimate thriller mystery that will keep viewers guessing all throughout!"
Euphoria,1,"You never know where you're gonna end up when you ride Euphoria's emotional rollercoaster, but at least you know that you won't be bored. [Full review in Spanish]"
Euphoria,1,"Far from being a portrait of “kids these days,” the show is a highly stylized exploration of a very particular set of kids, who endure the traumas inflicted on them by parents..."
Euphoria,1,"Levinson constructed a singular world with ""Euphoria,"" and in its second season, it's clear he wants to deepen it without losing any of its sense of extremity."
Euphoria,0,"There were some great moments, but this season could have been better. You really wanted to see more for all of these characters because the actors are genuinely so talented. You don't want to see characters be pushed to the side."
Euphoria,1,"While the HBO show is polarizing and easy to critique, it still manages to expand the genre of teen drama in unimaginable ways."
Euphoria,1,"The show really is so much more than absurd Y2K outfit inspo, an ad for sparkly eye makeup, or dreamy blue and red lighting. At its core, its a heartbreaking story of a girl trying to survive."
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria reminds us of the recklessness of being a teenager, the rootless, emotionally charged way you can live when there’s food in the fridge and no bills. What’s more euphoric than that?"
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria has become an aimless show -- even though it remains a hypnotizing one. In the disarray of Season 2, the series’ sense of nihilism is magnified."
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria is a show that revels in the maximalismthe colours are oversaturated, the camera is perpetually coked-out and characters have a tendency of casually saying things like, Its just heroin."
Euphoria,1,The show’s power to seduce and alarm also stems from its presentation of a teen life almost completely lacking in adult oversight.
Euphoria,1,"Buried beneath the expertly choreographed sex and pretense, Levinson periodically stumbles upon a truly affecting moment, although it usually has more to do with the performances than the writing."
Euphoria,1,Season 2 is a testament to Zendaya's trailblazing career in Hollywood...
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria remains one of the most explosive, heartbreaking, and entertaining shows on television. Season 2 started strong and kept getting better, all the way to an impressive finale."
Euphoria,1,"Thanks to the immense talent both behind and in front of the camera, Euphoria creates a world that is difficult to forget and impossible to ignore, for both."
Euphoria,1,This is the beginning of an unforgettable season for sure.
Euphoria,1,"The new episodes still pinball between the bombastic and the solemn, between understanding and exploitation, and that is its uncompromising identity."
Euphoria,1,Sam Levinson’s confidence in the script is palpable...
Euphoria,0,"It's the prevailing tone, at once nasty and tedious, that I loathe; watching the show, my mood hovers somewhere between boredom and dread."
Euphoria,1,The series doubles down on its claim as the classiest and most artistic form of the lowbrow high school drama ever.
Euphoria,1,"Luckily, the good parts of Euphoria are really good (namely Zendaya and Hunter Schafer), but the rest remains underwhelmingly thin."
Euphoria,1,"Pulling no punches, full throttle with one of the best seasons of any show I've seen, Zendaya rises the bar with a devastating emotional performance [Full review in Spanish]"
Euphoria,1,"Euphoria may address some of its weak spots in Season 2, but it hardly fixes all of them...but at this point, Euphoria's bombast and unevenness are part of its charm-not to mention a perfect fit for protagonists hopped up on hormones..."
Euphoria,1,"Addiction is where its strength as a story lies, and where Euphoria is most compelling. In that, it makes sense that the story is about teenagers: the difference between youth and adulthood is that, for a few brief years, bliss seems within reach."
Euphoria,1,"Maybe I'm projecting. But two years into a global crisis, Euphoria feels remarkably grown up in its broadening of traditional teen narratives for an audience permeated by insecurity and fear at all ages."
Euphoria,1,"Vicious and emotive, Euphoria commences its second season with an artistry missing in so many other shows about youth. And yet, it isn't just about Gen Z, it's about America as well."
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
Euphoria,1,"Levinson's ability to make audiences feel what the characters are experiencing is masterful and discomfiting, all at once."
Euphoria,1,"A tough, mature season that continues to border and cross boundaries while showing introspection. [Full review in Spanish]"
Euphoria,1,"It's strong stuff. It's meant to be. ""Euphoria"" is its own kind of twisted high."
Euphoria,1,Euphoria is the perfect show to usher in 2022...
Euphoria,0,Perhaps it's fitting: what could be more high-school than a sophomore slump?
Euphoria,1,Euphoria remains an imperfect gem that works best as a showcase for the next generation of towering acting talents.
Euphoria,0,Season 2 is exactly what a drama seeking to spark conversation fears most: It's skippable.
Euphoria,1,The new episodes offer scenes that are so insightful or artfully presented that Euphoria can feel in that moment like one of the very best shows television has produced in a while.
Euphoria,1,"More often than not, this version of ""too much"" is a hell of a drug."
Euphoria,1,"Darkly funny, emotionally draining... [a] wild and unforgettable ride."
Euphoria,1,Transfixing but uneven...
Euphoria,0,It's clear Levinson and his creative crew are out of ideas. But how many did they have to start with?
Euphoria,1,"Zendaya, who won an Emmy for her portrayal of Rue in the show's first season, continues to excel, finding new ways to embody her character's erratic shifts from elation to cruelty, insouciance to anger."
Euphoria,1,"Zendaya is fearless here. The terrific cast is very present in every scene of this show, creating characters who feel vibrantly alive."
Euphoria,1,"Now that the shock value has worn off, Euphoria never quite manages to reinvent itself. Even worse, there's a sense that it loses sight of its own strengths as well."
Mind Over Murder,1,"We’re always intrigued at the small town politics that are revealed when a violent crime happens in one of them, and that’s what’s driving the early episodes of Mind Over Murder."
Mind Over Murder,1,"The first side of the documentary is sometimes repetitive and the second side underserved, but Mind Over Murder remains a provocative thing, defying any kind of simple hero/villain/victim classifications."
Mind Over Murder,1,"[Wang's] comprehensive style, particularly her uncanny ability to diagram how authoritative systems can act against vulnerable individuals, somehow moves with a sharper precision than ever in “Mind Over Murder.”"
Mind Over Murder,1,"Still, at least some of the key figures in this decades-long nightmare seem to have reached some measure of closure, though just about everyone is still haunted by the events of 1985..."
Mind Over Murder,1,"It’s a sad, weird and totally absorbing story, and though she isn’t a pronounced presence in the series, Ms. Wang, born in China, brings an outsider’s astonishment to a case that still baffles native Nebraskans."
Succession,1,"Succession isn't just whip-smart, darkly piercing and frequently laugh-out-loud funny about its chosen milieu; it's the best drama on TV, one of the best-written shows on television, and among the best series all-round in general as well."
Succession,1,"While this was certainly an entertaining season, it feels like things are in the same place they were in season one. Things need to start happening in order to keep viewers entertained."
Succession,1,"It manages to build and build and build. Rarely do you get a show that in season three, really feels to be hitting its stride, but thats exactly what this show is doing."
Succession,1,"In its new season, the HBO drama goes full-throttle to prove that it’s still the pinnacle of television."
Succession,1,"Clever, caustic, and cynical as hell, with Season 3, Succession remains one of the most captivating portraits of American excess ever put to screen."
Succession,1,"For a show oft described as the spiritual successor and modern-day equivalent to HBO's Game of Thrones, it was more than somewhat poetic that the third season of Succession ended with its own Red Wedding equivalent episode."
Succession,1,"By hammering home the same cynical philosophy across three seasons, Succession reaches a level of despair that's all the more excruciating-and captivating-for how true to life it feels."
Succession,1,"If we didn't know that HBO had already greenlit a fourth season of Succession, the final episode of season 3 could have served as a brilliant series finale."
Succession,1,"The many layers, the multitude of creative insults and the tiny details that add up to make this show still the best thing around. Not to be missed."
Succession,1,"The story didn't let up. And neither did its brilliant actors, each of them living up to the demands of their characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
Succession,1,"Secession is a powerful and chaotic introduction to Succession's third season, allowing creator Jesse Armstrong and his writers to show off what they do best: smart plotting and bitterly funny one-liners delivered full of venom."
Succession,1,Now we will have to wait until the already confirmed fourth season... Hopefully it won't be long. [Full review in Spanish]
Succession,1,Succession is back with a new season so seamless you'll almost forget it ever stopped.
Succession,1,"All in all, Succession keeps getting better."
Succession,1,"It continues, in dense, hour-long episodes, to be exactly as it was before: funny, awful, irritating, cold, brilliant."
Succession,1,"This season feels like a strong evolution of what's come before - not meant as a slight towards the past, but more a confirmation that this show's only going to get better and better as it goes."
Succession,1,"Succession somehow only gets better in its third season, giving us more relentless nastiness, ridiculous humor, and remarkable performances. This is the stuff great TV is made of."
Succession,1,The stakes in every episode feel higher than ever. The sky always seems like it's creaking and about to fall but hasn't quite yet.
Succession,1,"The series is still the incisive satire it was when we last saw it in 2019, and it's just as impossible to look away from."
Succession,1,Series 3 doesn't offer the bleak trauma or grand betrayals of previous seasons - but it is the first time Succession has entertained the possibility of change.
Succession,1,"Focusing on sharply observed family dynamics, this powerful series continues to be satirical and suspenseful."
Succession,1,"The Roys gravitate towards each other not because of some familial bond, but because they've all been scarred by a shared past."
Succession,1,This still-in-progress season has raised the show's stakes without sacrificing the petty behavior that makes Succession such cathartic fun.
Succession,0,"Season three cares only for its mic drop moments. Succession has no grasp of narrative pacing, a show that gives its audience little to invest in beyond amusing one-liners."
Succession,1,The wounded family romance it sumptuously depicts is the primordial muck from which all our desires derive.
Succession,1,"The HBO series, now in its third season, feels almost Seinfeldian in its efforts to capture a group of eccentric, petty characters as they try, again and again, to one-up one another. Is Succession the best sitcom on television?"
Succession,1,"Happy, nasty viewing."
Succession,1,"It's great to have Succession back. We might not want to know the members of the Roy family, but it's an absolute pleasure to see them again."
Succession,1,"Logan's kids constantly doubt the personalities they've created for themselves, and one of the show's most brilliant aspects is depicting those uncertain moments precisely. [Full review in Spanish]"
Succession,1,"Succession returns for its third season with escalating Shakespearean drama, stinging writing and an even stronger perspective on the corrosive effect of extreme wealth."
Succession,1,"Who will survive and be the last man or woman standing? Whichever side you find yourself on, it is us viewers who win."
Succession,1,"Succession is funny; yes, it's about wealth; and, yes, it's really smart about the media. But for my money, the show is smartest about what it means to have an abusive parent."
Succession,1,"Funny, cruel and tremendously wicked, Succession hasn't yet peaked - it's just getting started, and oh what a joy it is to watch these deplorable, self-involved megalomaniacs tear each other to shreds in this exquisite, operatic opener."
Succession,1,Game of Thrones with helicopters.
Succession,1,"It may all be a play, but when the play is as nasty as this, it is impossible to look away."
Succession,1,Perfect cliffhangers between episodes. [Full Review in Spanish]
Succession,1,That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there. Dare we hope there could be a fourth series?
Succession,1,"It's the show that's now up there with The Sopranos, The Wire, The West Wing, even Poldark, and it's back for a third season. Do you wear socks? If so, it'll blow them off, it is so insanely excellent."
Succession,1,Below-par Succession is still well-above-par TV.
Succession,1,"God, it's such a relief. To hear that tense orchestral score."
Succession,1,Ensemble work doesn't get better than this.
Succession,1,"I still marvel at how Jesse Armstrong, the writer who perfectly captured the lives of two losers in a Croydon flat in Peep Show, has also created this show, set in the rarefied world of billionaires, and made it seem equally authentic."
Succession,1,"What continues to make this drama an absorbing experience is the sharp writing, the energetic acting and the way opulent wealth feels more like a blunt tool than sensuous pleasure."
Succession,1,"Succession spreads the dark hilarity equally among the Roys, although it takes about two episodes for the show to regain the equilibrium that makes it the most hilarious drama on TV."
Succession,1,"Succession still offers immersive escapism, to be sure... But at a certain point, I felt my attention starting to flag. Haven't we been through all this before? Is this still fun?"
Succession,1,"Succession may be from a different era, an old school HBO prestige series in a new school HBO Max world, but its story of flawed people in a mad dash for power will always be current."
Succession,1,"Succession is not for the faint-hearted or easily offended, but doled out in a weekly dose, this may be just the deliciously dastardly dramatic escape you've been looking for."
Succession,1,The strong cast... all have an offhanded way of delivering their barbs that is as naturalistic as it is rollicking.
Succession,1,"As the season builds to a tense shareholders' meeting in the November 14 episode, you sense there may be no winners in this blistering chess game."
Succession,1,"Season 3 often feels like a clenched fist: There's a compressed, almost uncomfortably tight focus on the aftermath of Kendall's mutiny, and it keeps punching its characters hard."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Succession,1,"What is a bit concerning, though: Does ""Secession"" seem a little too self-aware of the champing-at-the-bit hype in which this series is now ensconced?"
Succession,1,Bigger and better than ever.
Succession,1,Season Three of the HBO series goes full beast mode with varying degrees of success in what comes off as a primarily transactional cycle.
Succession,1,"The privileged, awful offspring of Logan Roy have to choose sides during the return of one of the best series on TV."
Succession,1,"Success hasn't spoiled Succession, as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun."
Succession,1,"Two years was a long wait, but the payoff is glorious."
Succession,1,"Maybe it's churlish to complain about a series that's still consistently better written and more refreshingly caustic than anything else on TV. But for me, Season Three reveals some wear in a concept that once felt rousingly original."
Succession,1,"This new season of Succession is so much the tragic, sure, but also the better and funnier for it."
Succession,1,"...the joy of Succession lies, as ever, in its script, whose sheer ickiness and cringe factor comes out of the double toxicities of the Roy family's dysfunction..."
Succession,1,"Propelled by the best ensemble cast you'll find anywhere-Nicholas Braun and Matthew Macfadyen are a dream team of lacerating laughs- Season 3 is the funniest, fiercest 'Succession' yet. It's a perverse pleasure to ogle the rich abusing their privileges."
Succession,0,"Succession is often very funny, and always extremely bleak. But the show's window-dressing doesn't deliver the same vicarious thrill anymore."
Succession,1,"Sarcasm and corporate jargon aside, Succession is an increasingly intimate look at how nobody can really hurt you like family."
Succession,1,"I found myself laughing more than ever at creator Jesse Armstrong's super-wealthy drama queens and opportunists. The Veep vibe is stronger and sharper, with characters gnarling out insults that seem to turn common obscenities into metrical poetry."
Succession,1,"It is a visceral pleasure to see Succession again. And its distinctive methods are intact: The seething jealousies and back-stabbing that unfold when the family unites; the flinty, often ferocious dialogue full of swearing and barking aggression."
Succession,1,"There are more laughs to be had watching Succession than most TV comedies, a testament to the show's writers who imbue the Roy children with specific foibles and a general lack of self-awareness."
Succession,1,"Every part of Succession shimmers. Armstrong's scripts are top-notch, brought to life by cinematographer Andrij Parekh, production designer Stephen Carter and director Mark Mylod, and set magnificently to Nicholas Britell's score."
Succession,1,"The stakes couldn't be higher for the embattled Roy family. And, for those of us watching safely from afar, the fun couldn't be sweeter."
Succession,1,"Succession season three delivers one helluva rollercoaster ride that keeps us gasping for air between the laugh-out-loud absurdity and intensely claustrophobic, emotional and no holds barred standoffs."
Succession,1,"The dialogue is as scabrous and funny as ever and the performances are still perfection... Still, it has to be said: there's something missing this time."
Succession,1,Triumphant return of TVs best.
Succession,1,There is still a lot of fight in all parties involved and it doesn't seem like things would die out any time soon.
Succession,1,"If Season 2 was a significant step up from the first, this third series is so miraculously funny yet mind-blowingly intense, Succession feels like it's now well on its way to reaching Sopranos, The West Wing, Mad Men-levels of excellence."
Succession,1,Succession's biggest weapon has always been its whip-cracking dialogue and the writer Jesse Armstrong has raised his game.
Succession,1,Succession is back for its third season and it doesn't miss a beat.
Succession,1,"The good news is ""Succession"" remains the same show it was two years ago. The great news is it made the most of that time away to amplify all its strengths."
Succession,1,"Crass and crude as ever, it's a delight to return to the filth of Succession."
Succession,1,"The third series had a lot to live up to -- but it does not disappoint. From the moment the jangling theme tune by Nicholas Britell rolls, worming its way into your head, you know you are watching something expertly crafted."
Succession,1,"Even in its most grandiose comedic moments, there is truth to Succession's cynical world that makes us realize yes, these idiots are absolutely in charge of our world and no, there's not really anything we can do about it."
Succession,1,Sometimes we are all blessed in ways we are not prepared to comprehend. It's still good to try to acknowledge it. That's all this is.
Succession,1,"What struck me first as I dove back in was not how thrilling or dramatic this show can be, but how laugh-out-loud funny it is."
Succession,1,"When they're throwing the most lavish and unbearable parties imaginable, Succession clicks. But every second we're talking directly about politics is a second we aren't making fun of Kendall for forgetting about his children."
Succession,1,"So far, at any rate, Succession's latest season is certainly off the hook - a real good job do-er, full of little Machiavellian f***s, and funny enough to leave viewers laughing as if they grew up on a hyena farm."
Succession,1,"Being a Roy is such a lonely endeavor, none of the members from this family can trust their relatives. The show makes you ponder: How much is too much money? At what point in financial stability do you stop being at ease and start becoming a prick?"
Succession,1,"Succession is well-shot and has firecracker dialogue and a talented cast that is easy on the eyes. But it doesn't elevate its characters, horrible people all; it exposes them."
Succession,1,"""Succession"" is crisper, funnier, and more confident than ever."
Succession,1,"Season 3 returns with just as much petty hilarity, punishing woes, and blazing performances as previous seasons with a civil war storyline to keep you hooked on the exploits of these awful rich people."
Succession,1,"The idea that Kendall, Shiv, Roman, and Connor are just damaged kids play-acting at adulthood is even more prominent this season, as the four siblings try to haggle, argue, and dissemble their way to common ground."
Succession,1,"Succession started out telling a story about the Roy family fracturing before showing those bonds start to mend. This season, the bonds that tie these characters together are ripped to shreds and we get a front row seat to the show."
Succession,1,"Again and again, Armstrong and his collaborators keep things fresh by reminding us that spinelessness is the defining characteristic for so many of its regulars."
Succession,1,"Much of the way through a glimmeringly brutal season, the greatest challenge Succession has posed for itself is, once again, pulling insight and enjoyment out of staring into the heart of darkness."
Succession,1,"Succession has quickly ascended to the type of series that ultimately defines a network, much like Game of Thrones and The Sopranos did for HBO years ago."
Succession,1,"It's a slower burn than Season 2, but that merely opens up new avenues for our soulless antiheroes to twist in the wind, especially as the family civil war heats up."
The Sopranos,1,"A show about everything, that meant something, that adds up to no specific conclusion, or realisation, or point of clarity. The wheel turns. The American Nightmare continues."
The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos is written with psychological depth and made with creative freedom. The result is personal, but not impenetrable or surly. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Sopranos,1,"The Sopranos came up with an ending just as murky and disorienting as the 85 hours that led up to it. Rather than betray its ethos by bowing to convention, The Sopranos went out on its own terms."
The Sopranos,1,"Who knows? We'll never know. And it's better that way. If you're thinking there's a movie in the works, think again. It was supposed to end like this."
The Sopranos,1,"Any explanation... no matter how smart or well-reasoned, misses the point. To explain it would diminish it."
The Sopranos,1,"Rather than an ending that would stop the conversation about Tony Soprano, Chase gave us an ending that will keep us talking."
The Sopranos,1,"Chase isn't the only auteur to turn an audience's bloodlust against itself, but unlike, say, Michael Haneke or Quentin Tarantino, he chose an unnervingly quiet way to leave us on the hook, in perpetuity."
The Sopranos,1,It's still a master-class in building tension. David Chase mines more suspense out of a family talking at a diner as a young woman struggles to parallel park than most pure horror directors could even dream.
The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history."
The Sopranos,1,"[Creator David] Chase was true to himself, and that's what made The Sopranos brilliant on Sunday night, and the 85 episodes that went before."
The Sopranos,1,"It's not TV, as HBO often reminded us. No, it was something on a much grander scale."
The Sopranos,1,"There is some evidence to support the notion that Chase punk'd fans with mad, self-congratulatory glee... But I admire his zeal in defying expectation."
The Sopranos,1,Chase played us like a grand piano.
The Sopranos,1,"It felt more violent, more disturbing, more unfair than even the most savage murders Chase has depicted over the course of six seasons, because the victim was us. He ended the series by whacking the viewer."
The Sopranos,1,"Its final season mostly crackled, with the usual superior performances and writing from actors James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and creator David Chase... For now it's curtains on an extraordinary achievement."
The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it."
The Sopranos,1,"Dark, funny, strange, a perfect way to begin this final examination of these characters' twisted psyches."
The Sopranos,1,"And so, bada-bing, just like a whacking, The Sopranos was done. But the range and capability of TV drama was expanded forever."
The Sopranos,1,"Chase had a grand time in his almost playful home stretch, offering a clue-strewn valedictory episode and a beautifully unresolved stopping point."
The Sopranos,1,"Somehow, though, it feels like the perfect final note. Why wouldn't a show that's taken such pleasure in rewriting the rules of storytelling go out in the least conventional way possible?"
The Sopranos,1,"All of the death foreshadowing the author finds throughout the series is present, and it steps up a notch in the final season."
The Sopranos,1,"David Chase, you sadist. We trusted you, and then you turned on us - and maybe we deserved it."
The Sopranos,0,"While it is one thing to flout the conventions of television, it's another to flip dramatic tradition, not to mention your audience, the bird."
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
The Sopranos,1,Mr. Chase wanted to end his tale without melodrama or even a splashy denouement. He succeeded.
The Sopranos,1,"Think of it as complete at last, a perfect whole. It's finished but it's not over. Life goes on."
The Sopranos,0,"For six seasons, the crime drama seemed worthy of being considered a work of art. But last night felt far too much like TV as usual with all its commercial compromises and unfulfilled promises."
The Sopranos,1,"Sopranos looks to be taking us on one of its darkest journeys yet en route to the finish line, setting a tantalizing table for the forthcoming climax."
The Sopranos,1,"If The Godfather: Part II offers a revisionist take on the 1950s American Dream, then The Sopranos is our elegy to that long-gone era of postwar affluence."
The Sopranos,1,It may have been the greatest double-take -- by the audience -- in the history of American television.
The Sopranos,1,"Each of the final episodes was anticipated not so much with pleasure as dread, since each posed the risk of an unacceptable loss, as characters in whom we had invested years of attention were swept away."
The Wire,1,[Michael K.] Williams quietly dismantled preconceptions about masculinity and sexuality alike and became a hero and icon both on and off-screen. It's not his only great acting role.
The Wire,1,"The Wire wasn't afraid to be gentle while laying out a bleaker truth for its viewers, delivering one of the more satisfying finales in television history."
The Wire,1,It's far more satisfying than the dismal end to The Sopranos and it is noticeable that there is nothing that would prevent HBO from making another season of The Wire.
The Wire,1,"Even if you came to series five cold, from a Wireless world, you'd have found plenty to enjoy: the way the dialogue is at once naturalistic and aphor-istic [and] the outstanding naturalism of the performances."
The Wire,1,"Quite simply, it was the best television drama ever made, and if it's ever surpassed it won't be on this side of the Atlantic. British TV does not have the resources, the scriptwriters or the actors even to attempt something on this scale."
The Wire,1,"The Wire amazes with its gritty attention to detail. It feels so damned real, and from Day One that's been both its blessing and its curse. You don't kick up your feet to watch. Nor do you feel at ease."
The Wire,1,"The Wire is a programme that demands your full attention but eventually it repays you, and once it begins to weave its spell you'll find yourself, much like several of its characters, totally hooked and desperate for more."
The Wire,1,"The Wire isn't the most accessible series. The show lays out a lot of plot strands, forcing the question: Where are we headed? Stick with it, though, and you'll see a remarkable tapestry."
The Wire,1,"So much happened. At times it seemed too rushed, but ultimately it all came together as plots were hatched, schemes crumbled and truth and honesty took a major beating."
The Wire,1,"The plots are labyrinthine and defy easy entry. The dialogue resonates with the lingua franca of the streets, so there's much that can't be accessed until viewers get used to the language."
The Wire,1,The Wire avoids caricatures with pitch-perfect depictions of the criminals scrapping their way to the top of a bloody heap.
The Wire,1,It's great to once again be in the company of these amazing actors... And it's a pleasure to be treated to amazing writing that doesn't try to simplify things and/or pander.
The Wire,1,"This season, series creator David Simon has added an extra layer of interest by focusing on his newspaper roots. This season also is less complicated than past seasons."
The Wire,1,"It's a tale less of crime and punishment than crime and survival... It all adds up to a message that requires a very precise rhythm, in script and performance, and from the first moments of this new season, The Wire is locked in."
The Wire,1,"Led by a solid core of returning characters -- none true villains, none true heroes -- with important additions (and sad subtractions) each season, it's one of the best series of all time."
The Wire,1,"""The Wire"" is unquestionably the best show on television."
The Wire,1,"Amidst the rubble of a failed city, Simon created an engrossing human drama about the eternal struggle between aspiration and desperation, ambition and resignation, in other words, the fight for the American Dream."
The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised."
The Wire,1,"It's the best season of television's best show. So goodbye to The Wire, it's been a great run."
The Wire,1,I'm praying that [David Simon's] fury at the Sun won't overwhelm his genius for storytelling.
The Wire,1,"Ultimately, the show doesn't even have a moustache-twirling villain. There are just people. David Simon and his brilliant cast and crew did everything in their power to depict these people are honestly and fairly as possible."
The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past."
The Wire,1,"In a season filled with great performances, the menacing portrayal of Marlo Stanfield turned in by Hector is the best reason to watch season five."
The Wire,1,"... if you're looking for new episodes of the best cop show on television, well, we won't say it. Enough is enough, right?"
The Wire,1,"Creating a microcosm of a broken nation, The Wire remained, to the very last fade-out montage, as messy and often painful as life itself."
The Wire,1,Among the many things that separate The Wire from other TV dramas is the way that creator David Simon eases into a season.
The Wire,1,This episode quickly reminds us of how completely believable and engrossing the world Simon has created is. Every moment feels genuine.
The Wire,1,"The dense mythology of HBO's The Wire, painstakingly created over five novelistic seasons, has enough drama packed inside to be easily spun out for the next five, ten, 15 years."
The Wire,1,The show will go out as one of the medium's greatest.
The Wire,1,"The absence of gimmickry and the presence of respect for the story and the audience give The Wire organic advantages over nearly all other TV dramas, whether they deal with cops and crime or birds and bees."
The Wire,1,"Some of the themes in The Wire may be generic (underpaid cops, newsroom politics), but the series achieves immense success in one vital regard for drama -- the feeling that we are in a real place."
The Wire,1,"Based on the seven episodes previewed, it's every bit as cynical, riveting and brilliant as the four flights that preceded it -- a searing look at the decay of a major American city that puts most of what's on television to shame."
The Wire,1,"It is as if, in a guilty fever, we dreamt up our own worst punishments-stories of the sort Joan Didion used to tell us about the princess caged in the consulate and the man with the candy leading the children into the sea."
The Wire,1,"It is one of the most intimate and alarming depictions of urban America on television, and yet it's an invigorating and even exhilarating experience, each season a new Harry Potter book for adults."
The Wire,1,The Wire certainly is Dickensian.
The Wire,1,"The fifth and final season may be the most overtly farcical, but only because things in this slightly fictionalized Baltimore have become, if you can imagine, worse than ever. When the going gets tough on The Wire, the tough get funny."
The Wire,1,Simon can rest assured that he's created something unique that will last well beyond the confines of its prime time ratings prison.
The Wire,1,"If there's one problem with The Wire, it's that, five seasons in, too many beautifully realized characters fight for too little room - a gem of a complaint to have."
The Wire,1,David Simon's sprawling epic of urban decay is as good as this startlingly brilliant show has ever been - and it has always been among TV's best.
The Wire,1,"Not exactly a Hallmark card, but one hell of an artistic achievement."
The Wire,1,Fans of the show will not likely be disappointed. This new 10-episode season boasts the same high quality of production that this series has always exhibited.
The Wire,1,The odds are good that you have not yet watched the first four seasons of The Wire... and that means that I as TV critic have failed you. Mea culpa.
The Wire,1,"Once again, Simon does the impossible. He takes themes we've heard a million times - our politicians are corrupt, our schools are failing our kids, our newspapers are being raped by corporate overlords - and he gracefully, subtly realizes them onscreen."
The Wire,0,Simon so forces events in the improbable newspaper story line of an invented serial killer that he does serious damage to the credibility of the police drama.
Station Eleven,1,"The ideal show for right now... a lyrical, heartfelt and character-driven apocalyptic musing with an immediate difference."
Station Eleven,1,"Yet everything coheres brilliantly over time. The final result is one of the most emotionally engaging, and visually and formally stunning, series of the year."
Station Eleven,1,"It achieves its own beauty and coherence, embodying Mandel’s point about the importance of art adapting to the circumstances of the moment."
Station Eleven,1,"It is the series’ willingness to stare unblinkingly at the ugly, incomprehensible aspects of mortal existence that save it from becoming maudlin. Station Eleven remains affecting because its earnestness never feels less than hard-won."
Station Eleven,1,"For all the horrors of the premise, you can't help but be comforted by a series driven by the faith that humanity's creativity and kinship will always endure."
Station Eleven,1,"Adapted from Emily St. John Mandel's sprawling, time-hopping post-apocalyptic novel, the book's transition to TV results in a more streamlined but still flawed exercise in end-of-the-world storytelling."
Station Eleven,1,"It asks us to think about big questions - the importance of community, memory, shared history and art."
Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven is a slow burn. The first few episodes look beautiful but move at a stately pace. If you can stick with it, you will be rewarded."
Station Eleven,1,"It's an intelligent, genre-bending piece with a hint of the uncanny. Well worth checking out."
Station Eleven,1,Station Eleven depicts a post-apocalyptic world where meaning still exists and darkness and trauma haven't won.
Station Eleven,1,"Its stately pace and pandemic subject matter won't be for everyone, but Station Eleven is an achievement of the tallest order, full of tenderness, experimentalism and captivating design."
Station Eleven,1,"At its best, Station Eleven knows when to stray away from its source material -- to which it remains faithfully dedicated to throughout -- in all the right places, building upon the rich world Mandel created."
Station Eleven,1,"Based on the 2014 novel by Emily St. John Mandel, and adapted by Patrick Somerville, it's actually a surprisingly appropriate story at this moment, embracing new life more than it grieves what has been lost."
Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven has some of the mournful, big-canvas flavor of that earlier HBO show. It's a puzzle-box of a series, with the narrative elegantly switching timelines between the start of the flu in 2020, and the decimated results 20 years later."
Station Eleven,1,"A hopeful story of human care and resilience, and a defiant manifesto for the value of creativity."
Station Eleven,1,It seems it's only a matter of time before one of these bugs has our number and many of us find ourselves in Miranda's absurd situation...
Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven requires audiences to pay attention, offering up a dramatic tapestry of considerable depth. Spanning a twenty-year time period encompassing flu outbreaks, population obliteration, and then recovery, Station Eleven is engrossing stuff."
Station Eleven,1,"ou shouldn't miss out on Station Eleven even if you're feeling pandemic fatigue yourself... Rather than compounding our own fears, it transports us past them."
Station Eleven,1,"Powerful, elegiac, and entirely too realistic for those living through the COVID-19 pandemic, this series has profound things to say about life, loss, and the human spirit: if you can bear to watch."
Station Eleven,1,The result is not only satisfactory but in many cases fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]
Station Eleven,1,Captures the immensity of the world in all its dimensions. [Full review in Spanish]
Station Eleven,1,A world amazingly constructed by Hiro Murai and company. [Full review in Spanish]
Station Eleven,1,"The series jumps back and forth through time elegantly, scattering puzzle pieces that are extremely gratifying, if heartbreaking to put together."
Station Eleven,1,Here is art that can speak to the moment with a special sense of understanding.
Station Eleven,1,What a multi-faceted and strange journey.
Station Eleven,1,"Station Eleven is haunting and beautiful but also lyrical and in the face of so much death at the hands of an invisible killer, this story manages to show us what people are really capable of."
Station Eleven,1,"This isn't even close: Station Eleven is the best new TV show of the year. It's haunting, gorgeously made, heartfelt, an end-of-the-world vision that lifts you up as much as it gives you nightmares."
Station Eleven,1,"Grace, hope, and encouragement are foundational elements of ""Station Eleven"" that help turn what could've been a very bad idea into a profoundly cathartic experience."
Station Eleven,1,"With as much emphasis placed on the characters and emotional drama as the sci-fi elements, Station Eleven is a show that's easy to get hooked on and hard not to bemoan the seemingly long wait for the next episodes."
Station Eleven,1,"Watch the season's coming attractions at the end of the episode. It'll put the first episode in a new, more hopeful light, and it makes the relationships that were established make more sense."
Station Eleven,1,"Through masterful directing and editing, each episode conveys the way that history lives and breathes within memory, coexisting with the present, whether within a performance or a fugue state."
Station Eleven,1,"The subject matter might not be something that everyone wants to embrace. It's about a pandemic and its aftermath. But it is done with such beauty, sensitivity and assuredness that, really, it must be seen."
Station Eleven,1,One of the most moving depictions of the resilience and sheer depth of feeling of human beings I have ever seen.
Station Eleven,1,"Like the 2014 novel on which it's based, Station Eleven is not about a pandemic, not really-it's about the way art, community, and family endure even after the end of civilization as we know it."
Station Eleven,1,"The 10-episode miniseries pulls off an incredible feat: it is a masterpiece. The timing of our own pandemic escalates the horror and doom of the show, but also makes every emotional beat even stronger."
Station Eleven,1,"As Station Eleven moves forward, it becomes clear that the series' denseness is its greatest success. It weaves the stories of its eight principal characters in a way that never feels redundant or overcomplicated."
Station Eleven,1,"Once you get the rhythm, Station Eleven delivers a poignant exploration of the meaning of survival while asking us to imagine a better way to live."
Station Eleven,1,Station Eleven wrestles with the very nature of entertainment in a time of natural and economic devastation.
Station Eleven,1,"It requires some patience. More than I might have invested, were it not for professional obligations. But I'm glad I stuck with it..."
Station Eleven,0,"In the end, ""Station Eleven"" may be too attached to its rose-colored glasses."
Station Eleven,1,There's an incredibly moving undercurrent of hope that pulses throughout this production.
Station Eleven,1,"On the style-substance spectrum, ""Station Eleven"" registers as a flawed but engrossing work whose narrative imperfections are masked by the considerable craft of its execution."
Station Eleven,1,"It's a life-affirming, soul-warming, catharsis-inducing work of art that's here to heal."
Station Eleven,1,"Scattershot and transfixing, an adaptation that honors much of Mandel's tone and intent but alters and expands (not always for the better) the world she so wondrously built."
Station Eleven,1,"The stakes remain impossibly high, the story uniquely compelling, but the net effect is to find this chronicle of a shattered, scattered human civilization strangely comforting, even hopeful."
Station Eleven,1,A disjointed but at times transcendent 10-part adaptation of Emily St. John Mandel's acclaimed novel.
Station Eleven,1,"Murai is one of the great visual stylists working in television right now, and the first few seconds of the series serve as a thesis statement for everything to follow."
Station Eleven,1,"Mostly the timbre of Station Eleven is set by those opening scenes Lawler and Patel, whose unsentimental tenderness is quiet testimony to what excellent actors the pair of them are."
Station Eleven,1,"The depiction of theatrical performance here is moving -- suggesting a power in connection, through storytelling, that sustains under the worst of circumstances. That spirit shines through a flawed but bighearted adaptation."
Station Eleven,1,"Somerville smartly plays to the strength of his medium, wisely combining certain threads and separating out some of the storylines into standalone episodes."
Station Eleven,1,Station Eleven is the quintessential case of an adaptation that doesn't just draw from the best parts of the original novel but actually finds a way to improve on the source material.
Station Eleven,1,"Fans of the book may not enjoy the changes but the heart of this haunting, sprawling story remains intact."
Station Eleven,1,"If you can keep track of the diverse characters young and old, randomly ricocheting through time, and enjoy a bit of the Bard... this ensemble sci-fi series envisions the post-pandemic future and offers a variety of fictional possibilities"
Station Eleven,1,"Despite the seemingly bleak subject matter, and the action and suspense of Kirsten trying to protect her friends from various cults, Station Eleven is often surprisingly goofy and light on its feet."
Our Flag Means Death,1,Sweeter than a bottle of rum to a buccaneer.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Scenes such as Ed being allowed to explore his emotions are what make Our Flag Means Death so meaningful and, sadly, so rare in a landscape full of male-centered shows."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Seeing a non-binary character so effortlessly existing as themselves and moreover, so effortlessly accepted by their compatriots was something I didnt realise I hadnt witnessed before. The profound effect this has had is indescribable in words."
Our Flag Means Death,1,It’s a show that becomes consistently funnier and tighter as the season progresses. But it’s the show’s intentionality and attention to detail that separates it from other comedies of a similar tone.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Effortlessly charming, instantly addicting, and utterly heartbreaking, Our Flag Means Death is without question one of the best original comedies in years."
Our Flag Means Death,1,Theres an exciting wealth of possibilities to explore that proves Our Flag Means Death is a treasure hunt worth venturing out to discover.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"It is the chemistry between the two leads, who are old friends from New Zealand, that keeps this lark afloat."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"The show is also wickedly funny, clever, and never stops holding your attention. Darby and Waititi have incredible chemistry, and the whole crew works together in every scene to create a family wed love to be a part of."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Our Flag Means Death is one of the most unique comedies bobbing out in the ocean of scripted television right now. It brings the laughs, the subversion, and the misty eyes in equal measure."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"witty, heartfelt, and utterly compelling"
Our Flag Means Death,1,"With endless laughs and exciting performances, Our Flag Means Death plants a flag that sets it apart from others in its genre."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Despite the show’s star power and pedigree, it’s ultimately just a slightly salty sitcom set on the high seas... The humor, though hardly revolutionary, finds some unique beats along the way, with a frequent target being toxic masculinity."
Our Flag Means Death,1,Audiences will appreciate the production values that take you back to the 1700s as much as the humor is relevant for 21st-century life. Our Flag Means Death is as ridiculous as it is funny and that is more than enough to make it a must-watch.
Our Flag Means Death,1,Maybe it’s not such a bad thing to have a pirate show with no reason for its existence other than to just laugh.
Our Flag Means Death,0,"Ultimately, it’s got enough amusing moments and talented performers to offer some comedic escapism once a week, but anyone looking for another “Shadows” or “Flight of the Conchords,” should sail to other waters."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Quirky Kiwi humor abounds, but underpinning it is real darkness and a sense of impending doom."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"The prolific auteur’s new series, starring Rhys Darby, is a terribly funny (and true!) tale of a gentleman pirate and his merry band of thieves."
Our Flag Means Death,0,"While in some ways, Bonnet is a role [Darby] was born to play, with plenty of opportunities for flailing both verbally and visually, many audience members may find he quickly grates."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Darby is the perfect choice for the foppish aristocrat desperate to be taken seriously as a pirate, albeit one who practises “polite menace” and reads bedtime stories to his illiterate crew."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"With a series that relies this much on turning early gags into later drama, and on piecing together big emotions out of small beginnings, the binge experience is likely to be a lot more compelling."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Our Flag Means Death often struggles to balance its comedic and dramatic elements, but its ensemble cast serves as the highlight of the series."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"The ensemble nature of Our Flag Means Death provides plenty of opportunities for the cast to shine. Darby has played buffoonish characters in the past, but he seems born to portray Bonnet."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"By exploring interesting character dynamics, Our Flag Means Death finds a way to evolve beyond the premise’s novelty."
Our Flag Means Death,1,The most interesting thing about Our Flag Means Death -- if also what might disappoint fans hoping for something more patently ridiculous -- becomes how it ends up more gently introspective than outright funny in its hunt for comic treasure.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Although Our Flag Means Death isn’t laugh-a-minute, it’s got a good-enough story to set up a unique workplace comedy. It may take a few episodes, but the funny stuff will come once the ensemble is well-established."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Our Flag Means Death won’t be the deepest show you’ve seen about a midlife crisis, or the most dramatic — but should you find yourself in the mood to relax on mostly warm, mostly gentle waters with an adorable group of weirdos, it’ll hit the spot."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"With the launch of Our Flag Means Death, pirates are officially back in style  though maybe not quite in the way they'd expect."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"A pirate comedy that's fresh, irreverent, and full of winning performances."
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
Our Flag Means Death,1,"[A] fine, funny, oddly sweet and surprisingly fact-based period comedy..."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"In Our Flag Means Death, the farcical humor is more of the subtle, knowing variety than it is playing for big belly laughs."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Irreverent, silly and stuffed with stars — including Waititi as Blackbeard — this wannabe-pirate story will make your cares and stresses walk the plank."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"The pirate setting is unique, but it should be funnier than it is."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Paired with a lively cast and a handsome production fit for his vivid adventures, the new series is as silly and smart as we’ve come to expect from Waititi’s productions."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"The show is ostensibly based on the real-life Bonnet, reimagined as a comedy; a take on ""The Office"" if Michael Scott's employees complained about not murdering too infrequently."
Our Flag Means Death,1,"Our Flag Means Death takes a little while to get going, but once Waititi and Darby are allowed to share the screen together, the fun doesn't stop."
Tokyo Vice,1,As compelling as it is disturbing.
Tokyo Vice,1,The look and feel takes a leaf out of the Michael Mann stylebook: the city is slick and nocturnal.
Tokyo Vice,1,"Mann’s glinting urban naturalism, with extended sequences that supplant dry exposition with telling images, creates a vivid foundation."
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
Tokyo Vice,1,"It doesn’t know quite what it’s doing. But when you’re young and lost and far from home, who does?"
Tokyo Vice,1,"…imperfect, irregular, and fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"
Tokyo Vice,1,"With style, intelligence and mystery to spare, Tokyo Vice is the kind of sprawling crime drama that actually lives up to the label of ‘prestige’ TV."
Tokyo Vice,1,Any show that has the courage to call the Backstreet Boys I Want it That Way a masterpiece deserves some brownie points.
Tokyo Vice,1,"The series is excellent overall, and offers an entertaining viewing experience for folks looking for a new hard-boiled detective series to sink their teeth into."
Tokyo Vice,1,"It may not be as hip as Miami Vice, but Tokyo Vice is every bit as captivating to watch."
Tokyo Vice,1,"The show does not feel extravagant, but it delivers on a vast and difficult premise. With tactile, emotive flashes of violence, it explodes when it needs to and keeps tension otherwise."
Tokyo Vice,1,"At times Tokyo Vice teases that a gritty, fast-paced thriller is about to ignite, but it pulls back, taking time and space to reveal that, really, the central character is not the foreigner Jake, but it is Tokyo itself in all its complicated moods."
Tokyo Vice,1,"The unwritten rules are different in this underground, and Tokyo Vice orchestrates a special thrill in trying to get them on paper."
Tokyo Vice,1,Its prime focus is on its characters’ navigation of an environment rife with mysteries buried under layers of rituals and codes of conduct...
Tokyo Vice,1,One of the best shows of the year so far.
Tokyo Vice,0,"In an overabundant genre where story lines tend to follow the familiar beats of an investigation, viewers have to care about the hero. And that’s tough when his inner life is given minimal attention."
Tokyo Vice,1,Tokyo Vice is best appreciated as an in-depth look at how one of the world’s most fascinating cities operated at the turn of the century...
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
Tokyo Vice,1,"At its best, the series sketches out a detail-rich portrait of Japanese society and the criminal world that operates in its shadows."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Michael Mann, who directed the sensational pilot episode of this fact-based series about an American reporter (a terrific Ansel Elgort) covering the crime beat in Tokyo, shows you how thrilling action can be when a world-class talent is calling the shots"
Tokyo Vice,1,What makes this HBO Max series more enthralling than your average cops and gangsters show is that it’s actually about the hard work of journalism.
Tokyo Vice,1,"A feast for those enjoying suspense, detective stories, and a taste at Japanese culture"
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
Tokyo Vice,1,"I found it satisfying in its deliberate pacing, and the characters absorbing enough to warrant my time. But it’s easy to imagine others feeling a bit restless."
Tokyo Vice,1,"The lush look and cultural immersion make for a gripping drama, though Ansel Elgort is more of a blank slate than a charismatic lead."
Tokyo Vice,0,"For all its visual pleasures, “Tokyo Vice” is guilty of sidelining its most fascinating characters. And with so many other streaming shows fighting for our attention, that’s a punishable offense."
Tokyo Vice,1,“Everybody pays” is a line heard several times. They do. I’m as eager as anyone to find out how much.
Tokyo Vice,1,"“Tokyo Vice” is made with style and attitude, and should easily become your next streaming addiction."
Tokyo Vice,1,"It is so far an intriguing mix of familiar flavors and unusual spices. How it finishes we will learn together, but so far, so very good."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Its main character may be a bit of a boorish, overconfident American, but Tokyo Vice compensates for his clumsy presence by creating a fascinating, rewarding world around him."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Although Tokyo Vice is not wholly innocent of exoticism and cliché, the series does a nifty job of taking us around Tokyo back during the heyday of the yakuza."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Viewers will be won over by this series’ charms and mysteries, even if it frustrates and falls short in some of the aspects that draw in viewers in the first place, specifically Mann’s involvement and the thinly drawn Adelstein."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Worth the investment, at least if you’re inclined to enjoy leisurely neo-noir."
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Bolstered by taut dialogue verging on the hardboiled, a smattering of viciously swift action, and a lead performance from a star more comfortable than we’ve ever seen him..."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Tokyo Vice is a mystery, a thriller, a portrait of a city, and an emotional story about people who are just trying to live their lives on their own terms, any way they can."
Tokyo Vice,1,Don’t let the stranger-in-a-strange-land story (and Elgort’s presence) put you off Tokyo Vice; it’s as moody and atmospheric as any Mann-led tale you’ll see.
Tokyo Vice,1,"Watanabe quickly becomes the show’s MVP playing a cop who knows how the game is played and who’s willing to show Adelstein how the police work in Japan. When the focus is on the two of them, Tokyo Vice is at its best."
Tokyo Vice,1,It’s Watanabe and the show’s other Japanese actors... whose performances and character backstories are compelling enough to overcome the slightly repetitive dialogue and sometimes workmanlike direction.
Tokyo Vice,1,"Gorgeously shot and impeccably acted by everyone involved in its production, Tokyo Vice is a fascinating, compelling series that  like the streets of its titular city  holds plenty of surprises around every corner."
Tokyo Vice,1,"The show slowly comes into its own, becoming richer and more interesting with each one. Its a program that will demand patience, but that increasingly feels like it will be worth the effort."
Tokyo Vice,1,"[Kept] me consistently engaged, while at the same time making me wish that this latest entry in a long-outmoded genre might find some way to go a little deeper instead of hovering on the surface of something and someplace fascinating."
Tokyo Vice,1,"At its best, Tokyo Vice drags the viewer’s arm through the bars, alleys, offices, and homes of the city’s many classes and communities, providing a rounded picture of a place that leaves room for the thrill of exploration and discovery."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Tokyo Vice has some narrative problems as hard to miss as a flashing neon sign, but it's kept watchable by its slick style and strong performances until its story picks up. Once it does, it's pretty engrossing. It just takes longer than it should."
Tokyo Vice,1,"This is a decent show, but one that feels like it would be much better if it were willing to be more Japanese."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Mann’s sense for the visual language of temptation -- conveying vice both as a scourge to be eliminated and as a decadent pleasure -- enriches Tokyo Vice. So, too, does his understanding of hierarchies, within both the criminal and legitimate worlds."
Tokyo Vice,1,"With fascinating characters and vivid urban ambience, 'Tokyo Vice' is a visually stunning crime drama thatll have you hooked from the start. The creators, cast, and crew craft a Westerners unclichéd perception of Japan."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Anyone familiar with Michael Mann’s knack for off-center close-ups, who trusts in his steady excavations of unsavory men, should find Tokyo Vice a compulsive watch, even after the Miami Vice auteur exits the director’s chair."
Tokyo Vice,1,"Immersive and engrossing, if more conventional than you might expect...Michael Mann directed the pilot, which has just enough design, style and panache....He sets the tone for the show  more procedural than flash -- start to finish"
Tokyo Vice,0,"""Tokyo Vice"" has its moments, and getting Michael Mann as the first episode's director is a true ace in the hole. But that's kind of the best trick this show has to offer."
Peacemaker,1,You can tell theyve had an awful lot of fun with it.
Peacemaker,1,"Butts get kicked, friendships are solidified, and we get the best joke in the DCEU to date."
Peacemaker,1,"Luckily for DC, what sets Peacemaker apart is that it’s actually a good deal better than many of its MCU counterparts. Across eight excellent episodes, Gunn’s show is an absolute treat."
Peacemaker,1,"Anchored by a winningly charismatic turn from John Cena, Peacemaker shows that Gunn can flesh out a previously monotonal character and make him sympathetic, without sacrificing the silliness and subversiveness that most of us love him for."
Peacemaker,1,"Huge, irresistibly silly fun."
Peacemaker,1,"It’s a crass, gunge-smothered action romp and a moving drama about the death of the American Century: come for the thick, gooey substances, stay for the substance."
Peacemaker,1,"Gunn scores a bullseye with this series, blending vulgarity, heart and sheer insanity for a winning, killer combo – not to mention, an unskippable opening-credits sequence that you’ll never grow tired of watching."
Peacemaker,1,"Thanks to the strength of the ensemble, along with some of the wildest action sequences seen in recent memory, the series does deliver a lot of joy, along with the continued reminder that as Gunns work as a storyteller continues to get better and better."
Peacemaker,1,"While it certainly leaves room to do more in Season 2, it also feels like it's telling a complete story."
Peacemaker,1,"Its wacky, intelligent, original, and plenty badass to boot."
Peacemaker,0,"With Cenas undeniable charisma and a cast willing to play along with every insane scenario, theres quality moments. Its too bad that Gunn kept forcing chaos on a team and a series that would have benefited from a bit less ofwell, everything."
Peacemaker,1,"The first season of James Gunn’s DC series was funny and expertly staged, but most impressively, it added layer after layer to its titular hero."
Peacemaker,1,"If you couldve told me Book of Boba Fett, particularly after the terrific The Mandalorian, was going to pale in comparison to HBO Maxs The Peacemaker series, Id have forced you into the cold shower to help you ween off the drugs."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker makes for a great first DCEU TV show, expanding on the world of The Suicide Squad and making the most out of its charismatic and hilarious cast."
Peacemaker,1,"""Peacemaker"" seems like a silly juvenile romp from the outset, but it ends up being a thought-provoking meditation on trauma, parental manipulation, the patriarchy, and so much more."
Peacemaker,1,Peacemaker is a unique gem within the outlook of boring superheroes and exploited ad nauseam franchises.
Peacemaker,1,"Even in episodic form, James Gunn is an amazing storyteller who relishes in the wild and the weird."
Peacemaker,1,"Despite its faults, Peacemaker is a fun show, even if it doesn't prove its necessity in the DCEU."
Peacemaker,1,About as much fun as you are going to have watching that TV thing.
Peacemaker,1,"While Peacemaker may not be breaking any new molds, it thrives at playing to Gunn's strengths, now taken to the small screen."
Peacemaker,1,"The show is not for young superhero fans, and honestly, that's fun. Sometimes, we just want a raunchy superhero show that completely takes us in a direction we were not expecting."
Peacemaker,1,"It's a lot of fun, and it's irreverent. Like James Gunn's stuff, it has a lot of points to be made but it's very inappropriate and very funny in it's delivery."
Peacemaker,1,Peacemaker is a surprisingly funny and violent superhero workplace comedy that really makes you want to watch each episode back to back.
Peacemaker,1,Gunn has written a wholly original character naturally aided by the comics but also by John Cena who is 100% committed to everything Gunn throws at him.
Peacemaker,0,Despite the near-bottomless charm of star John Cena... Peacemaker is ultimately more of a flimsy throat-clearing than a show with anything to say.
Peacemaker,1,"Show creator James Gunn creates a layered kind of pathos with Peacemaker that counteracts all of the wild, goofy goriness. It's a nice balance of elements with an emotional core."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker is a great, entertaining show and I’ll absolutely stick with it... I just wish there weren’t so many would-be Christopher Smiths out there, walking around armed in the hopes of becoming the next “hero” on the evening news."
Peacemaker,1,Cena gets to flex his action and comedy chops...
Peacemaker,1,"Cena's comic timing and deadpan delivery raises the level of the entire series (well, so far), but Peacemaker is also compelling as a dramatic character with a past and with regrets."
Peacemaker,1,"Is Peacemaker silly? Yes. Over-the-top? You bet. But it's a welcome dose of rambunctious, filthy fun for the sometimes dour DC Universe."
Peacemaker,1,I grew to embrace the humor of it all. Cena really uses the force of his personality to push it forward.
Peacemaker,1,"The action scenes, powerful and magnetic, are often resolved with resources worthy of The Three Stooges. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peacemaker,1,"The HBO Max series turns John Cena's Suicide Squad super-assassin into a real boy by giving him a team, a mission and serious daddy issues."
Peacemaker,1,Gunn's best weapon in making Peacemaker palatable is old-fashioned storytelling.
Peacemaker,1,"""Peacemaker"" isn't perfect, but it follows the beat of its own drum, and that's enough."
Peacemaker,1,James Gunn's latest project as part of the DC Extended Universe has all the makings of a success.
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker, like The Suicide Squad, dispenses with the pleasantries and gives us a piece of art that is much more real than anything in the MCU ever will be."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker is a rude, crude and politically incorrect romp that feels more appropriate for this particular American moment."
Peacemaker,1,"The more I pressed on, the more Peacemaker's shaggy squalor started to endear."
Peacemaker,1,"The eight-episode season offers the same kind of oh-they-did-not-just-say-that laughs and violence-soaked adventure, if on an obviously lower budget than the movie had."
Peacemaker,1,"The show is big, dumb, rollicking fun. I like it a lot."
Peacemaker,1,"Cena was a stand-out in The Suicide Squad, an impressive feat considering the stacked deck that was its cast, and he's even better in Peacemaker."
Peacemaker,1,"James Gunn has crafted a heartfelt, twisted, absurd and violent series with a fun cast and one of the most comical opening intros."
Peacemaker,1,We all love our dumb superheroes... But there is real hope that Peacemaker can turn into a fun ensemble superhero action series with some real emotional payoffs between Peacemaker and the team who pretty much thinks he's a moron.
Peacemaker,1,"As welcome as its comic approach can be (in a world where there's too many caped heroes taking themselves too seriously), it's not clear who the show is for: it's too raunchy for kids, and too childlike for grownups. Middle-schoolers maybe?"
Peacemaker,1,"""Peacemaker"" admirably interrogates whether transformation is possible for people who commit terrible acts in the name of hideous, misguided beliefs."
Peacemaker,1,"Even if Brooks isn't meant to be the focus of a scene, she inevitably becomes it by the sheer force of her charisma. Making Brooks the co-lead of a high-octane, high stakes show like ""Peacemaker"" is frankly a no brainer."
Peacemaker,1,"""Peacemaker"" skewers the superhero genre - with respect - and serves up something different; an unconventional, laugh-out-loud romp that's as rude as it is enjoyable."
Peacemaker,1,"John Cena brings his acting chops to the ring in a Funny, Violent and emotional story alongside a very strong supporting cast. James Gunn and DC are the perfect match."
Peacemaker,1,"The show's more modest settings allow the audience to concentrate on its characters, and its sub-blockbuster production values don't preclude it from boasting its fair share of absurd action sequences..."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker proves to be a surprisingly profound yet hilariously profane spinoff of The Suicide Squad, thanks to the creative union of James Gunn and John Cena."
Peacemaker,1,"Expands on the film's unrepentantly trashy action with 8 episodes of cursing, stadium rock and body horror all wrapped around a surprisingly affecting character-driven drama."
Peacemaker,1,"At the centre is a terrific performance from Cena, who just goes from strength to strength when it comes to his comedic timing and delivery of laugh-out-loud lines."
Peacemaker,1,"A great follow-up/companion to The Suicide Squad. It's violent, raunchy and pretty funny. John Cena is awesome in this irreverent, wacky series that doesn't hold back on the DCEU and the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peacemaker,1,"Loud, raunchy, gory, and hilarious, Peacemaker feels perfectly in sync with the spirit and tone of The Suicide Squad, and offers another reason why Gunn's tremendous talents might be the one thing Marvel and DC fans can both agree on."
Peacemaker,1,"Cena, who is making his case for the next pro wrestler-turned-A-lister action star, harnesses an effective push-and-pull as a moron who is beginning to see the light."
Peacemaker,1,"A dirty, raunchy, extremely funny show that's surprisingly warm & wholesome in the right ways, while talking about generational trauma & abuse. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peacemaker,1,The most interesting part of such a basic and elementary series... is its constant and contradictory dialogue with political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]
Peacemaker,1,"This series luxuriates in its own ridiculousness, which it manages to balance with a compelling story."
Peacemaker,1,"Big, loud and sorta dumb but often fun..."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker's a likable lunkhead easy to spend time with, the main raison d'etre for a series that dims whenever he's not onscreen."
Peacemaker,1,"Gunn's rude aesthetic is on full display throughout, which should please his fan cult but can wear a bit puerile for the rest of us."
Peacemaker,1,"Brimming with references to D.C. characters such as Harley Quinn and Aquaman and brutally frank jokes about real-world figures, Peacemaker is a James Gunn creation through and through..."
Peacemaker,1,"Yet again, James Gunn delivers big on the irreverent humor while managing to infuse the story with a significant amount of heart and purpose. And as an added bonus, Peacemaker comes with unskippable and highly rewatchable opening credits."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Peacemaker,1,"Every episode has a clever twist or two, and there are some very funny scenes."
Peacemaker,1,"Self-conscious but never smug, sociopathic and yet also sweet, and timely if never preachy, it's the very sort of no-holds-barred, tongue-in-cheek endeavor that's become Gunn's specialty."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker isn't quite as sharply written as Amazon's The Boys, but James Gunn is aiming for the same sort of subversive superhero show, using excessive violence and biting humor to deconstruct the failings of the genre."
Peacemaker,1,"At its core, [Peacemaker] is a story about a damaged man doing his best to escape his toxic programming and become a better person... even if he is a bit of a dick about it."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker is bloody, bonkers, and brimming with sharp wit and legit warmth."
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
Peacemaker,1,"The approach allows for interesting performances out of the whole cast, who balance heavy drama with crass, juvenile humor extremely well."
Peacemaker,1,"[Writer-director James Gunn's] sensibility is brash, with a mordant undercurrent, and the tone is far more off-kilter than anything Disney+ has done with its Marvel spin-offs. It mostly works for this sometimes slight but often amusing series."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker quickly establishes itself as essential viewing for fans of The Suicide Squad, but it's a career-best performance from John Cena and the greatest opening credits of all time that will make sure you want to come back each week."
Peacemaker,1,"A bloody, violent, masterpiece of a series that continues the vibes of The Suicide Squad by combining heart, humor & flat out ridiculousness to create something truly special."
Peacemaker,1,"James Gunn has outdone his big-screen work with this profanely hilarious comic book story that is better than Deadpool, The Suicide Squad, and possibly anything else the DCEU has put out so far."
Peacemaker,1,James Gunn's latest superhero foray places a deplorable human being at its center and asks us to care. The request is large but worthy.
Peacemaker,1,"Like the countless DC Comics solo series of the 1980s, Peacemaker proves an essential point about the DCEU - that when you showcase the weirdest possible fringes of a fictional universe, it helps the entire universe feel bigger and more complete."
Peacemaker,1,"""Peacemaker"" doesn't exactly miss, at least for those predisposed to buy into it. But even allowing for that, and Gunn's shotgun approach to comedy, nor does it completely find its target."
Peacemaker,1,"Peacemaker, if you can stomach the title character's lunkheaded views (and temporarily forgive if not forget his actions in The Suicide Squad), is a lot of James Gunn fun."
Peacemaker,1,The character's spinoff series... seems compelled to walk back every unapologetically cold-blooded aspect that made Cena so entertaining to watch on-screen.
Peacemaker,0,"In contrast with the amusing 'Suicide Squad,' in James Gunn's ""Peacemaker"" limited series, the obnoxious, vainglorious anti-hero is the entire song, and it's a grating note that wears out its welcome incredibly fast."
Peacemaker,1,"For all the show's feints toward edginess, it colors well within the lines laid out by its predecessors. That's not entirely to its detriment - it makes Peacemaker a comfort rather than a challenge."
Peacemaker,1,An unapologetic parody of superhero shows that's also a pretty good superhero show in its own right.
Peacemaker,1,...the entertainment never stops coming in Peacemaker.
Peacemaker,1,The Peacemaker series feels mostly like the Suicide Squad comedy scenes without the big action of a $100 million studio blockbuster.
True Detective,1,It's already a feat to say this might be Mahershala Ali's best acting craft. But what amazes me is how perfectly it swerves around three different timelines. Impressive storytelling. Full review in Spanish
True Detective,1,Episode 27: Valhalla Rising / Bronson / Starred Up / True Detective S3
True Detective,1,"Pizzolatto also came up with an engrossing and very haunting slow-burn mystery that reaffirmed his place as one of the most exciting writers working in entertainment today. Hopefully, he gets to keep making this show for years to come..."
True Detective,1,"True Detective returns to past glories judging by the opening two episodes of its third season, with new leading man Mahershala Ali proving just about enough to revitalize the familiar formula."
True Detective,1,"Season three powers through with wonderfully dense visuals, a layered story and an absolute powerhouse performance by Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali."
True Detective,1,"I just wanted a moment when the characters caught their breath and didn't feel like they were part of an overly-scripted machine. Now, having said that, this is still engaging, dark, complex material, anchored by a great performance from Ali."
True Detective,1,[Mahershala Ali's] take on Hays enhances rather than overwhelms a story intriguing enough to justify the show's 35-year timeline.
True Detective,0,"A thin story spread over a lot of hours, but Ali is excellent and so is his support."
True Detective,1,"Fans will eat this season up, and for good reason. It's smart, it's intriguing, and there's a dreary atmosphere that can best be credited to director Jeremy Saulnier"
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
True Detective,0,"The criteria by which Season 3 should be judged is whether Pizzolatto lived up to his aspirations as an investigator of human nature. Really, he made a mildly engaging muddle."
True Detective,1,"Season three, which ought to be a fitting final chapter in the True Detective anthology, ended with a meditation on time and memory lost, love elusive and gained, beginnings and endings beside the point."
True Detective,1,Come for the unravelling Arkansas mystery - but stay for the mesmerising tour de force that is Mahershala Ali and you won't be disappointed by this latest outing.
True Detective,1,"I thought ""True Detective"" was dead in 2015 after a disastrous second season starring Colin Farrell. But there's life in this show yet, so long as the story's tied to a mesmerizing performance by a master actor playing a singular character."
True Detective,1,"Ali isn't in every scene in True Detective; it just seems like it. The show is Ali's masterpiece, and the third season is the best installment since it premiered five years ago to excessive praise."
True Detective,1,"True Detective deftly handles race, but once again leaves its women behind."
True Detective,1,"With Mahershala Ali at the fore, True Detective has become compelling viewing once again."
True Detective,1,'True Detective' returns to its roots and then develops its own voice. [Full Review in Spanish]
True Detective,0,Mahershala Ali is the most notable thing about this third season that desperately tries to imitate the first season. [Full Review in Spanish]
True Detective,1,"Season Three of True Detective doesn't have quite the pulling power of the first go-around, in which McConaughey's revelatory performance immediately jumped off the screen."
True Detective,1,"Featuring a case that jumps around like a jack-rabbit, look like a return to form."
True Detective,1,"""Time is a flat circle"" be damned - with Pizzolatto showing a bit more restraint, audiences get something straightforward, but filled with enough twists and turns to keep us on the edge of our seats."
True Detective,1,"Ali's character, Detective Wayne Hays, a Vietnam vet, a loner with a suspicious nature, is another of Ali's indelible characterizations, an absolute must-see."
True Detective,1,"True Detective's third season is progressing pretty nicely. The mystery is spooky and involving while not overly reliant on shocks and switchbacks, and it has enough emotional hooks to elevate it beyond the basic whodunnit."
True Detective,1,"Ali's powerful performance is backed up by those of Carmen Ejogo, who plays his wife Amelia, and Stephen Dorff , who is his partner Roland."
True Detective,1,Fans who have stuck around will be pleased to find that True Detective season three mostly returns to form.
True Detective,1,"Detailed, suggestive, just confusing enough, True Detective has made itself an active investigation once again."
True Detective,1,Ali plays [Wayne] magnetically; you cannot look away.
True Detective,1,"From a spirit laden community centre to a woodland pedophile campsite to the dark interior of Hays' mind, it's a brooding gem."
True Detective,1,"This third season of True Detective isn't contorting itself into season one, it's more nuanced and expansive in the ways it approaches masculinity."
True Detective,1,"Exploring the grim certainty of battling time, Ali carries the show by subtly pushing against expectations, finding empathy in the murkiest darkness that True Detective has ever explored."
True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space"
True Detective,1,"There's not that much new here, but the show is plenty entertaining and more than worth watching for Ali's performance alone."
True Detective,0,"True Detective bills itself as something better, but really, it's just more of the same."
True Detective,1,"Season three marks a return to form for True Detective, even if though it fails to reach the highs of its freshman effort."
True Detective,1,"This is often a one-man show for Ali, sometimes wearing prosthetics to make him old, grey and suffering from dementia, and he is terrific in all three timelines."
True Detective,1,"I remember having reservations about another True Detective season and those fears only being eased slightly when Ali was announced to star. If you shared my fears, please believe that Ali's arrival was a very good sign."
True Detective,1,"In the end, this is a decent, serviceable thriller, nasty enough to give the impression of not flinching away from the darkest natures of its characters, and sufficiently gripping to ensure that viewers should keep on watching."
True Detective,1,"The opening episodes are a success, thanks to Mahershala Ali, who always seems to have easy access to mysterious depths."
True Detective,1,"One divisive second-season later, the series is back with a whole new set of characters, but a mystery that feels elemental. Time is a flat circle, after all."
True Detective,1,"The first half of season 3 is promising, if a bit stiff, and anchored by Ali, who turns the Man Haunted by His Past into something a little different."
True Detective,1,"STREAM IT, mostly for the performances of Ali and Ejogo."
True Detective,1,"Whatever the outcome of the Purcell case, expect it to involve someone who simply cannot let go of what's come before - both in the context of the story's universe, as well as the larger narrative of the creative mind weaving the True Detective tale."
True Detective,0,"Yet again ""True Detective,"" after a drawn-out hiatus, capitalizes heavily on atmosphere, artistry and the celebrity aura of its star players, at times focusing more emphatically on this garb than the integrity of its narrative skeleton."
True Detective,1,"Because that actor is Mashershala Ali, it's a remarkable tour de force, keeping three balls in the air at once, in three eras, adjusting his performance in each one, based on what he's learned since."
True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.
True Detective,1,What made True Detective special was the haze of strangeness that hung about it like a supernatural mist. Let us join hands and mouth a ritualistic prayer in the hope that TD3 is every bit as weird and quietly deranged.
True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great."
True Detective,1,"What truly makes this chapter stand out is its willingness is take a step back to revel in what makes these characters - specifically Ali's - tick. It's not only a haunting mystery, but also a look at one man's struggle to find meaning in himself."
True Detective,1,Saulnier doesn't entirely harken back to the swampy and sweaty mood of the first season but what he brings feels a bit closer to what once made True Detective great.
True Detective,1,Given the cryptic and slow burning nature of the show - creator Nic Pizzolatto and co. are big on holding back key details until the right moment.
True Detective,1,"The effect of racial stereotypes on the carriage of justice is also examined. In this way the show succeeds in categories that early seasons couldn't even compete in, and categorically improves its canon."
True Detective,1,True Detective season 3 establishes its three timelines and the central facts of the case with a clever breathlessness.
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
True Detective,1,"If the season 3 premiere is any indication, we're in for jaw-dropping twists, genuinely crushing moments, and a truly sinister tale."
True Detective,1,"Season three marks a quasi-return to safety, albeit one that's needlessly more complicated and predictably dour."
True Detective,0,"While I appreciate Mahershala Ali's solid performance and the technical excellence of this gorgeous production, there is no sense of urgency or connection. Everyone is sleep walking through the case."
True Detective,1,"Almost four years after the underwhelming second season, True Detective has returned-and it blessedly resembles the original season."
True Detective,0,"Ali's performance is an example of what the show can be, but the third season as a whole remains as a disappointing reminder of what was."
True Detective,1,"True Detective has returned to its essence, just not with the same dazzling, controversial force."
True Detective,1,"It's an ambitious and imperfect work, beautiful and corny, believable and less believable by turns. I recommend it, with advisories."
True Detective,1,This is a script determinedly dedicated to the slow reveal. But it is also one alive with passion and a mordant wit.
True Detective,1,"Despite the shadowy distractions, ""True Detective"" is a solid procedural led by a faceted leading performance."
True Detective,1,"What elevates it are the brooding atmosphere and Ali's magnetic performance, from his dogged pursuit of the facts in his younger days to his convincing vulnerability in his elderly ones."
True Detective,0,"What ultimately sinks this season is the dull sameness of it all... nearly every scene has the same rhythm and pacing, often centered on two or three people conferring solemnly in hushed voices; the show could be titled Men Mumbling About Crimes."
True Detective,1,"Three seasons in, it's clear what ""True Detective"" is: a platinum-cast anthology of moody crime stories in which familiar cops with familiar demons chase familiar devils."
True Detective,0,"The third season of True Detective plays to the first season's strengths, but it also feels like an admission of defeat."
True Detective,0,"I wondered what I would think if neither of the previous seasons had existed, and I realized-I probably wouldn't be thinking about it at all."
True Detective,0,"It's clear that Pizzolotto still thinks like a novelist... His show struggles to find its sweet spot as a work of television, maybe because it's conceived with a pace and style that is better suited to the page."
True Detective,1,These efforts pay off in a solid third season whose structure and style hew close to those of the first.
True Detective,1,"Season 3 is absolutely better than a host of the artsy and moody mystery dramas that sprang up in True Detective's wake, and it runs (flat) circles around the over-stuffed sophomore season."
True Detective,1,Ali's performance as old man crumbling as the loss of his vast intelligence accelerates is wrenching. The old-age makeup is the best this viewer has ever seen and is utterly convincing.
True Detective,1,"True Detective season 3 is a vast improvement over season 2, but it never quite matches the strength and memorability of season 1"
True Detective,1,"Season three of the time-jumping, philosophically inclined series repeats season one's tricks, but gets a boost from its new leading man."
True Detective,1,"Ultimately, Season 3 is successful in reproducing the noble yet macabre journeys that feature in 1 and 2, while evolving itself in structure and tone."
True Detective,1,"Ali is breathtaking, giving us a trifecta of performances that grow increasingly complex with each passing decade."
True Detective,1,"Ali's performance is the only thing disguising how rote this all feels, and how much the series keeps repeating itself, within seasons as well as across them."
True Detective,1,True Detective gets back on track.
True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull."
True Detective,1,"Thankfully the third marks a return to absorbing, compelling form for True Detective."
True Detective,1,"The right lessons have been learned from the show's past, as outstanding performances both ground and augment the third season's solid, even affecting crime story."
True Detective,1,This is addictive television.
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
True Detective,1,"Where season three most improves upon the seasons preceding it, though, is in how it crystallizes something True Detective has always been about."
True Detective,1,"It's just a well-made, well-acted, intelligently plotted, thematically rich mystery show. In 2019, that's both plenty and not enough."
True Detective,1,"Tightly directed... and plotted, and with a performance at its center that steers away from calling attention to itself, the new ""True Detective"" transcends hype and amounts to 2019's first pleasant small-screen surprise."
True Detective,1,"The premiere episodes show a lot of promise plotwise, teasing out a season that gets to the uniquely spooky roots that hooked audiences in the first go-round. If the devil really has come to Arkansas, we're happy to fall under his spell."
True Detective,1,What sets this season of True Detective apart from either of the previous runs is that the crime here is not merely being investigated as much as it is being unraveled.
True Detective,1,"At the very least, the new True Detective season is a three-tiered showcase for Mahershala Ali, who stays consistently mesmerizing even if the mystery around him does not."
True Detective,1,"The show is good again and a near perfect copy of the show's creative height. The thing is, what we want out of our television shows has changed quite a bit in five years."
True Detective,1,The complexities in Wayne and Amelia's relationship - how they love and torment each other - is where the show really takes hold.
Doom Patrol,1,"This is not a seven episode season for anyone who craves convention. At times, the plot sequencing can feel chaotic, lurching. But tonally, Doom Patrol opens up boxes that offer opportunities rarely taken."
Doom Patrol,1,[I]t gives the viewers something that approaches wonderful.
Doom Patrol,1,"If that base remains stable enough, and the occasional (or not-so-occasional) addition of weird new spices to the blend remains exciting, Doom Patrol can keep rainy-day daydreaming as long as it likes."
Doom Patrol,1,"Doom Patrol's third season is off to a strong start. A few parts of each episode feel a bit slow, but overall, the first three episodes set the stage for another wild ride that I am more than ready to take."
Doom Patrol,1,"Michelle Gomez's arrival on Doom Patrol is pitch-perfect, just like she is."
Doom Patrol,1,"I'm giving this a fresh tomato because of the strong cast, and that I still haven't seen the 2nd half of the season. But this show seems like it's going in circles..."
Doom Patrol,1,Doom Patrol has learned the lesson that pathos not need require a morose tone. The show is at its finest when these flawed and funny people are allowed to be uproarious even when they're in pain.
Doom Patrol,1,"Season 3 continues this trend, with hilariously weird moments seamlessly giving way to internalized therapy sessions you can't find anywhere else in the genre."
Doom Patrol,1,The most absurd season yet -- in a really good way.
Doom Patrol,1,Television's best superhero show just keeps getting better.
Banshee,1,"With ""Requiem"", Banshee doesn't go out like the funeral procession its title suggests it would: but it's that final twist of optimism that seals everything neatly into place, a final hour that is more than a fitting farewell to a memorable series."
Banshee,1,Banshee isn't fooling anyone. It is what it is. [Full Review in Spanish]
Banshee,1,"We're back in the town that stay trying to replace Gotham City as the hardest place on Earth - Banshee, Pennsylvania."
Banshee,1,"At this point, I don't know where this show is going or what kind of ending we can expect, and that just makes me more excited."
Banshee,1,"As dark and nasty and psychologically tormented as Banshee has always been, it's also been fun on some level, and it's incredibly hard to have fun playing in this particular sandbox."
Banshee,1,The series remains the best action show on TV by far.
Banshee,1,"Banshee is the pulpiest series on television right now, and it's certainly the pulpiest series that's been on television in quite some time."
Banshee,1,It isn't long though before you start remembering how much you enjoy these characters
Banshee,1,"If there's one thing Banshee has always been, it's a show that does everything on its own terms, and that includes its ending."
Banshee,1,"While we expect shows to make bold moves as they near the conclusion, Banshee's shift as displayed here took some legitimate gumption."
Banshee,1,"Banshee's story is full of twists and unexpected connections, as well as its telltale brutal violence. In a sick streak of creativity, the show continues to find new, gruesome ways to kill people."
Superman & Lois,1,"Season 2 remains engaging thanks to its teenage relationships and family melodrama, courtesy of Clark Kents’ civilian neighbors, the Cushings. Perhaps without meaning to, the series becomes about the ripple effects of living in a world of superheroes."
Superman & Lois,1,"The premiere had everything I love about the show, including the stunning visuals, so it will be fun to watch where the series goes next."
Superman & Lois,1,Season 2 of Superman and Lois deals with the direct fallout from Season 1 whilst testing Superman's allegiance to the World versus his allegiance to the USA.
The Leftovers,1,"No matter how you feel about the actual subject matter, the performances and teleplays were transcendent."
The Leftovers,1,"Each episode is a reawakening, a daring reorientation of characters or setting, and they're all building towards something world-changing."
The Leftovers,1,The show ultimately connects the Departure to the experience of loss and grief - religion does not so much explain the mysteries of life as provide a framework for living within them.
The Leftovers,1,"It has been one of the most intense emotional experiences of the last years on television. And possibly, the best series of recent times. It leaves when we need it most. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Leftovers,1,"It isn't an easy watch. If you're struggling with grief, choose something else. For everyone else, The Leftovers is one of the decade's best shows and definitely deserves repeat viewing."
The Leftovers,1,"Pillar saints, sacrificial goats, four horsewomen of the Apocalypse, resurrections, miracles - it's all here."
The Leftovers,1,"Rather, the show is coming full circle, proving to be the same series it has always been. That doesn't make for a bad final run of episodes, just a flawed one."
The Leftovers,1,"The final season of the series was goddamn extraordinary, unbelievably rich and nuanced, and left such a lasting impression, I thought about it for months afterward."
The Leftovers,1,This spiritually shaking psychological drama promises more existential crises than enlightened answers.
The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers is one of our most intensely compassionate hours of television.
The Leftovers,1,"The third and final season is one for the ages, capping off an utterly unique time-tripping story about the end of the world."
The Leftovers,1,It beautifully ties up the themes and the character's journeys. [Full review in Portuguese.]
The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers cemented its legacy as one of the best TV shows of all time with a third and final season filled with humor, heartache, and unique personalized madness that was both baffling and relatable."
The Leftovers,1,An obituary of one of the greatest shows in the history of TV.
The Leftovers,1,"Nora's story is recognizable to anyone who's suffered trauma. It reflects a certain fantasy, even."
The Leftovers,1,"As the show broadened geographically it did the same tonally, newly injected with a kind of mordant humor as its characters began to give in to rather than resist its grand, apocalyptic currents."
The Leftovers,1,Keep the show near you; it's a keeper that will endure.
The Leftovers,1,"In an era of TV tough guys, Kevin is fascinatingly atypical."
The Leftovers,1,"It may well be that in the end, as in Lost, there are just too many stray threads to tie up. But whether or not the makers manage to nail the landing, it's quite the routine."
The Leftovers,1,"If you don't have religion, you should at least have The Leftovers."
The Leftovers,1,"It is the most audacious hour on television, going places other shows wouldn't dare tread, and yet every risk is rewarded with aplomb."
The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers miraculously turns that ambiguity into its greatest accomplishment.
The Leftovers,1,"The final season also pulls off another unexpected tonal shift, with several whimsical, absurd and laugh-out-loud moments even as it aches with sadness."
The Leftovers,0,It should feel like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It actually feels like The Real Housewives of New Jersey.
The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers will leave us with answers to the questions and puzzles it has been posing, and will fill in the gaps and spaces that beg to be closed. Real life imparts little in the way of such soothing conclusion upon the bereft."
The Leftovers,1,The final season steers the narrative and the viewing faithful toward something more rewarding than the promise of an answer.
The Leftovers,1,"As gonzo as the new season is, it never loses touch with what the show is about: coping with unbearable loss."
The Leftovers,1,"I'm not a person who tosses around the word ""awesome"" the way it's usually used today -- which is to say as a synonym for ""very good"" or ""cool."" No, when I say The Leftovers is awesome, this is what I mean: It fills me with awe."
The Leftovers,1,"There's still something about this program that can't be put into words. There's something almost religious about in the way you just need to see it, feel it, and believe."
The Leftovers,1,The Leftovers is a tremendous iceberg of a show on which one could write endlessly about just one or two calving chunks of interest and come nowhere near delving into even a small portion of what lurks underneath.
The Leftovers,1,"As these dirty-faced angels prepare to face their maybe indifferent, possibly nonexistent maker, Lindelof and Perrotta wisely break them off into single-character-focused episodes, which has always been the show's most effective method."
The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers is about the inability to process huge, traumatic events because you lack a frame of reference for them - which makes it feel very much like a series that has found its moment in history."
The Leftovers,1,"Between the prospect of a definitive ending, the looming fear of catastrophe, and the continually exceptional performances, it's bravura television that somehow follows the model of earlier seasons while subverting expectations."
The Leftovers,1,"As a barely watched and short-lived HBO drama, The Leftovers doesn't have anyone or anything to answer for. But if these final episodes are any indication, more shows should have that luxury and that freedom."
The Leftovers,1,"Returning this week for a third and final season, the work of several master storytellers, is HBO's The Leftovers, and if you have never seen it, try dipping in just to get a feel of how far TV drama has travelled in the past decade."
The Leftovers,1,"Like a good millennialist cult, The Leftovers grasps an outlandish idea with absolute emotional commitment: The performances in this final run are spectacular throughout, but especially Ms. Coon's and Mr. Theroux's."
The Leftovers,1,But this miraculous series masterfully holds ambiguity and extremely robust storytelling in the same generous bear hug.
The Leftovers,1,"I waited a long time for The Leftovers Season 3, and I can tell you that the show does not disappoint; it's going out at the height of its powers."
The Leftovers,1,"A preview of seven episodes (encompassing all but the finale) finds the series more assured and purposeful -- steadfastly moving toward something, whatever that might be, as opposed to away from the inexplicable event that set the story in motion."
The Leftovers,1,"on top of the phenomenal performances, stellar narrative structure, and compelling/emotionally devastating writing, the show's thematic relevance all but secures it a lauded place in TV history. Buckle up, folks-this is one hell of a sendoff."
The Leftovers,1,"Exciting, ambitious, baffling and not always tethered to coherent storytelling, The Leftovers is one of TV's best series."
The Leftovers,1,"I've moved past depression and into acceptance when it comes to this series, but I'm still going to miss it when it's gone."
The Leftovers,1,A satisfying final season to TV's most ambitious drama.
The Leftovers,1,"The Leftovers Season 3 is outstanding. It takes Season 2 and masterfully builds upon the characters' emotional backgrounds, giving them more depth and taking their journeys to stunning, unpredictable places with great reward."
The Leftovers,1,"Like Lost, The Leftovers overflows with mysteries and questions. Unlike Lost, it has never really positioned itself as a show interested in, or even capable of, providing answers."
The Leftovers,1,Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta's final season is a masterpiece more in tune with the moment than anything you'll see this year.
Friends,0,"Altogether, Friends is really just a bland show about bland characters living bland lives."
Friends,1,"Friends isn't a sitcom. It's a soapcom, a soap opera masquerading as a situation comedy."
Friends,1,[The series' scripts were] concise and top-level. [Full review in Spanish]
Friends,1,"The jokes and the adventures have not aged a day. It's a pure, classic comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Friends,1,I found myself laughing and identifying with the friends more than I had the first time. [Full Review in Spanish]
Friends,1,"Starting a TV show is hard. Ending one of the most beloved series of all time in a satisfactory manner? Almost impossible, yet Friends pulled it off here."
Friends,1,"It's a classic, heartwarming finale that gives you what you want with just as many laughs as you could want."
Friends,0,"The show never rose above its artificial, formulaic roots - characters assembled straight from the sitcom-writer's handbook, jokes delivered with mechanical predictability at the network-mandated rate of three per page."
Friends,1,"There are plenty of one-liners and memories that will leave you cheering, laughing and crying."
Friends,1,"It was more than a phenomenon; it was a smart, classy show."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
Friends,1,"Season ten actually gets a pretty hard time, but while the stars do sort of become caricatures, there's still so much to love about it: after all, she got off the plane."
Friends,1,Kauffman and Crane stick the landing with a two-part series finale that doesn't forsake the show's signature comedy for non-stop emotions-though there are plenty of emotional moments too.
Friends,1,"Thank heavens for Phoebe. Ditzy, dotty, certifiably insane Phoebe, played by Liza Kudrow, and surely the funniest role."
Friends,1,"[""Friends""] benefited from some terrifically funny writing and the kind of cast chemistry you luck onto only once in awhile."
Friends,1,"The show was perfectly cast, the writing was snappy...and the plotting, as the Ross and Rachel story built, was a masterpiece of delayed gratification."
Friends,1,"While not one of the absolute greats, The Last One deserves a place here for reasons of sentimentality. Put simply, it's the last one. It's the end of an era. That's not to say it lacks for laughs. There are plenty here."
Friends,1,The much anticipated finale episode on NBC signed off with an episode of surprises. But one story line turned out exactly as fans expected.
Friends,1,"I always felt ""Friends"" respected me -- and my intelligence. Mostly because the show never seemed to be trying to make the audience laugh. It was more like the characters were laughing with us -- and, better yet, they usually weren't laughing at all."
Friends,1,"Friends was rarely less than consistently funny, boasting some of the finest acting and sharpest writing of any American sitcom. Ever. Period."
Friends,1,Friends presented a unique balance between making us laugh and giving us reasons to cry.
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
Friends,1,"Still, the writing is often intelligent, and the acting is skillful. Long-time fans are often rewarded with jokes that reference past episodes and personality quirks; familiarity makes this show all the funnier."
Friends,1,The old gang finally closes this chapter on their lives together. It's been fun...and real.
Titans,1,"there are enough surprises, fatalities, and cursing to mark Titans Season 3 as the show finally achieving its proper stride."
Titans,1,"Busy as Titans already is with its proper members, pulling that sort of storytelling here might be a challenge that the series isn't quite yet up to, though."
Titans,1,"A little soap-operatic at times, but Titans has some great action, sincere, honest and personal moments making it a great DC superhero series worth bingeing."
Titans,1,A Massive Improvement from a borderline unwatchable 2nd Season. One of the biggest turnarounds in a TV show in recent memory.
Titans,1,"Titans still comes with a harder edge and better action than the average CW superhero soap, but it's risking its heart and wit with a story that clearly favors a small portion of its cast."
Titans,1,"These characters need to be given more room to grow as well as expand upon their individual storylines. Other than those constrictions, the series is fun and riveting television with great action, a fantastic cast and thrilling storytelling."
Titans,1,"Even though this season feels more like a Bat Family show with a little bit of Kory and Gar mixed in, this seems to be Titans at its strongest."
Titans,1,The show seems plenty watchable -- and occasionally jarring in its surprises -- without feeling like a top-tier series. Part of that has to do with a storyline involving the villain Red Hood that inches along in advancing the plot.
Titans,1,DC's 'Titans' Season 3 Wastes No Time Proving It Is The Best Season Yet.
Titans,1,"This is very much a story of two Robins and the man who raised them, and in that way it feels powerful and intimate. But fans of the wider Titans team might be left wanting as the laser-sharp focus centers on Dick Grayson and Jason Todd."
Titans,1,"This three-episode premiere was bursting at the seams with drama, culminating in one of the most shocking scenes in the history of the series and setting the tone for the rest of the season."
Titans,1,"But for the most part, thanks to some major early character deaths and decisions, Titans Season 3 rivals even Batman's darkest tales for their grown-up sensibilities - probably because it's adapting a couple of them at once."
Titans,1,"Best season yet! Brenton Thwaites continues to stand out as an excellent live action Nightwing, and the move to Gotham helps to focus the show. DC fans will be pleased."
Titans,1,"By far the best season yet. It fixes most issues from seasons past, and Red Hood is a brutal villain! Finally this show is getting good -- REALLY good."
Titans,1,"By the end of its first five episodes, Titans Season 3 is the show's best version of itself, but the series has, historically, had trouble sticking the landing."
Titans,1,"Titans is continuing to fall victim to some of its worst tendencies, while reminding us that it is still a bold, gritty, striking take on the DC mythos."
Titans,1,This barnstorming third season really puts Titans on the map.
Titans,1,"Titans' storytelling has tightened up, the characters are finally getting along and being heroes, and the new cast additions somehow improve on an already loaded ensemble."
Titans,1,"Titans Season 3 maximizes its stellar cast to tell a compelling and emotional story of loss, love, fear, and family, refining its formula to deliver the best season of the show thus far. If you've been waiting to dive in, now is the perfect time."
Titans,1,"Season three features Titans' strongest storytelling, a confident narrative that juggles its many pieces with deep reverence for the source material."
Rick and Morty,0,Season 5 of Rick And Morty is worryingly uneven for the cartoon that breathed new life into the medium.
Rick and Morty,1,"It's all incredibly bleak, and somewhat shocking, but incredibly good TV while it lasts."
Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" isn't the kind of premiere that suggests a new direction for Rick and Morty -- as a matter of fact, it seems to confirm we're heading in the old one. But that's fine with me."
Rick and Morty,1,"It's Rick and Morty doing hacky action at its best to kick things off, and naturally, we wouldn't have it any other way."
Rick and Morty,1,"The opening salvo of the new season is spectacular: insane joke density, an ever-present silliness brushing up against bad taste, awkward social situations laid bare, and hilariously tearing classic sci-fi and genre conventions a new one."
Rick and Morty,1,"When a show's middle-of-the-road episode would be the highlight of another series, it is clear that the series has entered another echelon of television. It's no secret that Rick and Morty is in that echelon."
Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a solid season opener. No fills (though lots of fins). A few great lines mean the incoming Nimbus can now take a seat at the conversation concerning the show's best ever guest characters."
Rick and Morty,1,"Yes, Rick and Morty is as funny and sharp as ever. But this time around, Rick isn't in control."
Rick and Morty,1,"As season openers go, this is a really solid entry from Rick and Morty. Nimbus is an instantly memorable character and the Morty storyline is a reminder that Morty is capable of having hilarious adventures without Rick's direct involvement."
Rick and Morty,1,"Thanks to the guidance of creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, the fifth season continues to develop while it blows our minds with new universes, timelines and TV-MA situations, making it more than just a sci-fi toon with the occasional dick joke."
Rick and Morty,1,"A tiny, almost throwaway plot detail can mutate into a gloriously surreal digression that threatens to overwhelm the main narrative. You find this in the best Simpsons episodes too, but I've rarely seen it done with more outrageous verve than it is here."
Rick and Morty,1,"The rapidity of the laughs and the rat-a-tat style of the whip-smart dialogue is sometimes dizzying, but what sets this apart from the similarly toned Family Guy is the jokes stay with the story."
Rick and Morty,1,It's a quite brilliant 22 minutes and one with an implicit moral.
Rick and Morty,1,"It's kooky, irreverent, innovative and fun... 'm curious to see where Season Five takes us."
Rick and Morty,1,The simultaneous fondness for the recurring motifs of speculative fiction and its irreverent mocking of twists and tools that have been done to death are central to this show's duende. And that's also a major reason we love Rick.
Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is another functional Rick and Morty episode... But a functional Rick and Morty still guarantees you a lot of clever sci-fi tropes taken to extremes in creative ways, so, yeah, pretty good."
Rick and Morty,1,"The Season 5 premiere doesn't necessarily feel like a return to ""classic"" Rick and Morty, and nor does it feel like a dramatic departure. But the episode's straightforwardness... is a welcome shift."
Rick and Morty,1,"Rick and Morty persists not only for its inversion of sci-fi tropes, clever pop culture riffing and raw hilarity. It continues to hold our interest in a way few shows do because it knows we are all capable of great and terrible things."
Rick and Morty,1,"If ""Rick and Morty"" wants to toss in some more serialized stuff into Season 5 instead of trying to constantly outdo itself, that might be a way to keep this early momentum going."
Rick and Morty,1,"""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is a pleasant start to the new season, and a good reminder why we enjoy having these weirdos around."
Rick and Morty,1,"If not the biggest or most daring season premiere the series has delivered, ""Mort Dinner Rick Andre"" is nonetheless an enjoyable start to the new season."
Rick and Morty,1,"The premiere shows a lot of promise for the season as a whole. It's just as inventive as ever, and by not resetting the status quo, there's more room for character development."
Raised by Wolves,1,"A future-shock caper with real weight, it harks back satisfyingly to the sci-fi that existed before George Lucas fired up his lightsaber and ruined all the fun."
Raised by Wolves,0,Raised by Wolves wafts into emotional and narrative oblivion.
Raised by Wolves,0,"It’s a lot. A lot of weirdness that instead of being fed to us as mysteries for us to theorize about, or as simple pieces of a puzzle, they instead become seeds for further mystery-box tropes."
Raised by Wolves,1,Heres hoping Raised by Wolves continues to reward the audiences faith and doesnt let the shows enduring riddles swallow it whole.
Raised by Wolves,1,Science fiction of this kind is sorely needed in a time of pure spectacle. It has a canvas that is rich to gaze at but it’s the intellectual stimulation that really delivers.
Raised by Wolves,1,The Ridley Scott-produced HBO Max series about warring religious and atheist factions has entered its second season. And it’s time you started paying attention.
Raised by Wolves,1,"There is simply nothing like Raised by Wolves on television. It’s sci-fi, but it also really leans into fantasy. It’s stocked with strange ideas and compelling performances, and has a keen sense of aesthetic."
Raised by Wolves,1,Season 2 never risks becoming boring -- the minimum requirement for any hourlong series. Collin and Salim alone should hold your attention.
Raised by Wolves,1,"Raised By Wolves season two starts out with a whole lot of stuff going on, but it already feels like a far more balanced season than the first."
Raised by Wolves,1,"While the show's canvas has expanded, it hasn't lost its focus on the big questions of faith, identity, and family it's been wrestling with since the pilot."
Raised by Wolves,1,"It takes about 20 minutes to find its footing again, but S2 moves even faster & is more interesting than S1. Collin & Salim are wonderful additions to Ridley Scott's androids."
Raised by Wolves,1,"So far, Raised By Wolves Season 2 isn't trying to appeal to a wider fanbase, but is playing to its core audience of weirdos. The new season doesn't just feed us; it gorges us on knotty science fiction and bonkers plot twists."
Raised by Wolves,1,"It is clear from the start this season is trying to raise the stakes from season one. The bizarre, twisted, Sci-Fi feel fans know and love doesn't take long to show up."
Raised by Wolves,1,"While its two-part premiere feels like a return to status quo, Season 2 kicks off with deepening emotional mysteries. The performances remain impeccable, and the show is still poised to be a haunting exploration of faith and flesh."
The Tourist,1,"A well-greased concept, a confident approach, clever plotting, a fabulous cast: they're all on offer here, and they hit their marks."
The Tourist,1,This surprisingly gripping limited series is perfectly entertaining and has everything you'd assume from an action drama.
The Tourist,1,"A lot of Harry or Jack Williams previous work, such as Baptiste, it was very grounded and set in the real world, which at times resulted in the twists and turns feeling rather unbelievable. This show has never felt believable!"
The Tourist,1,"Even if it doesn’t wind up exactly where you hoped, in its stronger moments Tourist is a trip worth taking . . . at least some of the way."
The Tourist,1,"This can be very funny at times  a traffic jam caused by two turtles rooting in the middle of the road is an early highlight. But the focus remains the two-fold mystery: who exactly is our hero, and why does at least one somebody want him dead?"
The Tourist,1,"Overall, I dont think anyone will be disappointed with The Tourist and it may actually surprise some people. There is nothing here you havent seen before but it is delivered in an entertaining package."
The Tourist,1,"The Tourist hooked us in with its story, plus the performances by Dornan, Macdonald and Brune-Franklin. Let’s hope the story continues to be interesting as the season goes on."
The Tourist,1,"The cast is from mixed national backgrounds and it’s scripted by two Brits, yet an Australian flavour is immediately apparent in the form of its spectacularly filmed desert setting."
The Tourist,1,"Despite the uneven tone, The Tourist executes its story with style."
The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue."
The Tourist,1,"As an Irish amnesiac eluding a cabal of killers in the Australian outback, Jamie Dornan is so good youll follow him anywhere, which is what gives this relentlessly funny, ferocious, thrill-a-minute series the staying power to haunt your dreams."
The Tourist,1,"Dornan now joins the ranks of Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, and former co-star Dakota Johnson as a person who made interesting choices after their franchise ended and looks to become one of our credible millennial actors."
The Tourist,1,"Even with its occasional excesses, The Tourist is a mostly taut, pretension-lite mystery with a vivid setting, a few surprises and a great trio of lead performances from Jamie Dornan, Danielle Macdonald and Shalom Brune-Franklin."
The Tourist,1,"This funny, suspenseful six-part thriller doesn't merely keep us guessing. It keeps its amnesiac hero guessing, too. He knows even less about his own story than we do."
The Tourist,1,Creators Harry and Jack Williams come up with enough unique characters and wild twists to keep the six episodes fresh and entertaining.
The Tourist,1,"The story would have been tighter with one or two fewer episodes. Still, it’s an entertaining series that has drive, even when it’s going in the wrong direction."
The Tourist,1,"This is a great little thriller, a show that constantly keeps you guessing and entertained in equal measure."
The Tourist,1,"There are a lot of moving parts here, with gears that mesh smoothly."
The Tourist,1,"The show mimics a Liam Neeson action-thriller here, but theres almost a real-life sloppiness that it brings with it. Nothing is neat in The Tourist."
The Tourist,1,"Constantly second-guessing our handle on what we think is happening, its quick-witted crack ripe for bingeing,"
The Tourist,1,"The Tourist is a better black comedy than an action thriller, with an appreciably off-kilter comic sensibility throughout."
The Tourist,1,"It was derivative in parts, but nicely intriguing and slyly funny. Dornan, who starred in the Fifty Shades film series and therefore knows a thing or two about climbing from a wreckage, has star quality to burn."
The Tourist,1,"In another production, these elements might feel rushed, but The Tourist, directed by Chris Sweeney (and Daniel Nettheim for the final three episodes), knows how to play the quiet scenes alongside the crash and bang."
The Tourist,1,The lovely thing about The Tourist is that the fun is enormously infectious.
The Tourist,1,Welcome to your first television addiction of 2022.
The Tourist,1,"The Tourist sets up a beautiful mystery: thrilling, breathtakingly simple but still densely complex."
The Tourist,1,"Dornan's performance is a slow-burner. Confusion -- and a lack of mobility, hobbling around on crutches -- grows into a sullen resolve to chase down any scrap of a clue about his past."
The Tourist,1,"It's extremely watchable, and might even be making the earliest possible bid to become one of the TV events of the year."
The Tourist,1,"Finally, a television thriller that doesn't feel formulaic."
The Tourist,1,"It's well worth watching this fun, stylish and confident caper, which clearly still has numerous twists up its sleeve and characters to play with."
The Tourist,1,The dialogue is crammed with oddly quotable lines. Fans of Fargo (and I am certainly one) will love it.
The White Lotus,1,"A perceptive, alluring and excellently cast satire that hooks viewers from the outset, and then keeps them both guessing and obsessed."
The White Lotus,1,The summer’s most talked-about show exposes the insidious power of wealth and whiteness. That’s what makes it so watchable.
The White Lotus,1,"In the second half, the drama part of the drama-comedy rises to the fore with most of the characters becoming increasingly vulnerable."
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus' most damning conclusion was that rich white folks are destined to win, because society is stacked against everyone else and has been designed to support them across hundreds of years."
The White Lotus,1,White's masterful bait-and-switch of a murder mystery that was actually about class irked a lot of people. We stand and applaud.
The White Lotus,1,"It was sublime cringe comedy but with moral underpinnings in its satire of wealth, entitlement and privilege, wonderful performances, and produced a new star in the Australian Murray Bartlett as the unravelling general manager."
The White Lotus,1,One of the most addicting shows of 2021.
The White Lotus,1,White Lotus is fairly clearly a sadistic comedy in the classic Seinfeld vein. No one actually learns anything.
The White Lotus,1,"A necessary reminder that there are alternative visions of human life, in which purpose and power are not tied to wealth, even if it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to find such a vision.."
The White Lotus,1,Bartlett's performance is superb. [Full review in Spanish]
The White Lotus,1,"White Lotus is wholly entertaining, but its waters aren't as deep as they could have been."
The White Lotus,1,"It's an interrogation of wealth's impact on personal behavior. An avowed fan of reality television (specifically Survivor, which he personally competed in), White imbues The White Lotus with the genre's soapy sensibility."
The White Lotus,1,"You may not get to as beautiful a location as The White Lotus this year, but you'll certainly be glad you didn't stray too far from your TV screen to watch this blackly comic delight."
The White Lotus,1,"The strong cast includes Connie Britton, Steve Zahn and a never-better Jennifer Coolidge, giving us a character who's a fascinating mix of pampered idiot, pitiful overgrown child and insatiably needy monster."
The White Lotus,1,"It has jokes but is also deadly serious. Plus, the characters are all sublimely well drawn, especially Jennifer Coolidge's fuzzy, lonely alcoholic and Murray Bartlett as the passive-aggressive hotel manager."
The White Lotus,1,"The casting is on point, with Murray Barlett delivering a particularly impressive performance as the resort manager who begins to unravel."
The White Lotus,1,"A pitch-black satire, perfectly blending comedy and drama."
The White Lotus,1,A sharp satire of our most dangerous and wholly absurd modern socializations.
The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism."
The White Lotus,1,"Everyone in it is so good it's almost invidious to single out special performances. But the star turn has to be Bartlett as resort manager Armond, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who becomes deliciously, hilariously, apocalyptically unstuck."
The White Lotus,1,The 'eat the rich' genre is pleasurable because it plays into our fantasies of watching the obscenely wealthy get their comeuppance. The White Lotus takes this a step further by having its rich cannibalise themselves.
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus is a treat, as challenging and hilarious as it's unexpected."
The White Lotus,1,"You don't have to be Bolshie about class to appreciate what White has done here, because he is never thematically heavy-handed."
The White Lotus,1,This delectably written show bursting with an unforgettably monstrous cast of characters delivered by awards-worthy performances refuses to release its grip.
The White Lotus,0,The White Lotus gets to fail upwards.
The White Lotus,1,It is a self-made hell in paradise: delicious.
The White Lotus,1,All this is delicately anatomised over the course of a strong story just soapy enough to let it slip around easily but not so much that it doesn't snag your attention.
The White Lotus,0,"The creator, director and scriptwriter of the series, Mike White... abandoned any kind of subtlety to establish a clear position. [Full review in Spanish]"
The White Lotus,1,"This series features a great cast, an incredibly weaved narrative, and a mystery that keeps you on your toes until the very end."
The White Lotus,1,"Like a wasp in a strawberry daiquiri, menace seems to be lurking beneath the surface of everything here: think Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None with added tiki torches, aloha nachos and Xanax."
The White Lotus,1,"Mike White is working through some things here, and I don't know if these six episodes are an admission of his white privilege or an apology for writing The Emoji Movie. Or both."
The White Lotus,1,"Dreadful rich people make for brilliant TV, but it is rare to see their privileges and prejudices skewered with such relentless precision. White's characters can be monstrous, but they are so carefully wrought that they also feel painfully human."
The White Lotus,1,"In all that lopsided shape, The White Lotus told a deeply tragic story, and an angry one."
The White Lotus,1,"Even in this nightmarish vision of paradise, there are plenty of human remains, and this sharp, funny series, quite possibly the comedy of the year so far, is all the richer for it."
The White Lotus,1,"For most of The White Lotus, it was easy to forget about the death teased in the series' opening scene. But in the end, the death was an ideal distillation of the show's themes."
The White Lotus,1,"White's series is sharply observed even if, finally, it's fairly slight. We're offered deft sketches of rich people behaving badly in a beautiful environment. But there is a predictable pleasure in watching them squirm."
The White Lotus,1,"In the world of White Lotus, consequence - even when it's as grave as death - is of much less import than privilege."
The White Lotus,1,"Ostensibly, the show is a murder mystery, but really it's a searing exploration of class, wealth, and relationships played out between a mixed bag of painfully familiar characters."
The White Lotus,1,"Watching Bartlett as Armond navigate their demands is often very, very funny; it's a sublime performance, playing against an ensemble of famous and instantly recognisable faces."
The White Lotus,0,"By the end of the six-episode miniseries, the farce is still ongoing, but the joke is thinking that things could have turned out any other way. Fates were always sealed."
The White Lotus,1,A fine marriage of smart writing and a fantastic cast.
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus may have some odious characters, but you will not be able to look away."
The White Lotus,1,Mike White's HBO tragicomedy is one of the best shows of the year.
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus' captivatingly character-driven whodunnit would not come across as clearly without its excellent cast, all of whom are worthy of note."
The White Lotus,1,"It's a familiar cast, lots of solid actors including Connie Britten, Steve Zahn and the luminous Jennifer Coolidge, who is glorious in every scene."
The White Lotus,1,"Watching snarky, satirical Mike White skewer petty privilege and quirky dysfunction is a mixed bag of economic and gender inequality."
The White Lotus,0,"If you like rich, self-absorbed bores whining and wittering among themselves, fantastic."
The White Lotus,1,"Without Rothwell or Coolidge's genius performances and genuine chemistry, the show might collapse into a pile of misdirected white guilt and wealthy, girlboss delusions"
The White Lotus,1,You will find yourself laughing when you didn't expect to and sad when you thought you would smile.
The White Lotus,0,"Without a more cohesive story giving it narrative momentum, it often becomes a series of vignettes involving awful, irredeemable people who never make the right choice - and whether that's entertaining or even stomachable really depends on your mileage."
The White Lotus,1,"Across all six episodes, a convincing thesis emerges: The curse of the privileged is that they would rather be miserable than lose even a tiny fraction of the things they've been given."
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus is a class-conscious comedy of manners, and it gets a ton of mileage out of its incredible and deep cast, who each play their variations on upper-class entitlement with subtlety and humor."
The White Lotus,1,"Coolidge's revelatory performance has been heavily praised, and Rothwell deserves just as much recognition as an actor best-known for comedy, but offering a nuanced dramatic performance."
The White Lotus,1,"Although the first episode doesn't dig too deeply into each character since it's too busy introducing them all, there's plenty of development left to mine throughout the season."
The White Lotus,1,"If it's still hailed as the best series of the summer, that's only a reflection of the low quality of everything else. I'll be happy to watch this one straight through."
The White Lotus,1,"In the end, Lotus is fitfully funny and diverting rather than compelling viewing. Let's just hope there's plenty more wisdom of Armand to come."
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus is a destination event, a safe, controlled daytrip into disquiet. Some will love the airy cringe that White purveys here, which intensifies as this series goes deeper into its run."
The White Lotus,1,A richly written satire with a top-notch ensemble.
The White Lotus,1,"Like Enlightened, The White Lotus won't be for everyone, but it rests nicely within HBO's aesthetic of rich jerks, their toxic traits, and the unfortunate people who happen to die because of them."
The White Lotus,1,[A]n excellent dark comedy with White's DNA all over it.
The White Lotus,1,"With The White Lotus, White was able to add additional layers of depth that are at once satisfying and savory, funny and provocative."
The White Lotus,1,"Playing a character who is hard to like, let alone tolerate, Coolidge is outstanding, as she makes Tanya's stunted emotional life kind of sympathetic."
The White Lotus,1,"Even when the most thinly drawn uppity guests are gnashed by White's satire, you'll savor every delectable shred of schadenfreude."
The White Lotus,1,"Across six enthralling episodes, White's tapestry unfolds as a tug of war between the hotel's guests and the employees on hand to serve their every fussy desire."
The White Lotus,1,"""The White Lotus"" sneaks essential questions in between the laughs. It is certainly among the year's best TV offerings."
The White Lotus,1,"If you can't find something in here to enjoy, you're just not trying very hard."
The White Lotus,0,"Natasha Rothwell's Belinda is the most likable and human character, but her story arc is far too predictable and often gets lost in the dark hijinks..."
The White Lotus,1,"What really defines The White Lotus is the addictive way each story builds, exposing character quirks, doubts and secrets along the way."
The White Lotus,1,A fitfully diverting and gorgeously filmed six-part limited series.
The White Lotus,1,The series is ripe for all kinds of fun and suffering and humanity.
The White Lotus,1,"While the beauty of its setting is captured in lovely shots of turtles swimming to the surface of the sea and the twinkle of string lights over cozy dinner tables, this series is, unlike the staff of the White Lotus, not here to make you comfortable."
The White Lotus,1,"There's a finely tuned social choreography among the ensemble, so many scenes slowly, brilliantly playing out for maximum discomfort... each player on their absolute A-game."
The White Lotus,1,"""The White Lotus"" could use more attention to the downstairs half of its upstairs-downstairs story... But this is a sharp, soulful series that knows its characters in full and gets richer as it goes on."
The White Lotus,1,"""Lotus"" is a triumphant, deliriously funny satire of the privileged classes against a gorgeous backdrop."
The White Lotus,1,"I got wrapped up in the dreamy dramedy. Looking's Bartlett stuns as a tightly wound perfectionist falling way off the wagon. Rothwell, hysterical on Insecure, goes 180 degrees as a wellness worker bee carrying the weight of moneyed sorrow."
The White Lotus,1,"The most reliable source for laughs - and heartache - stems from Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the resort's spa manager, and Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a rich woman in distress over her mother's death."
The White Lotus,0,"The trollish timing of the show's premise, that vacations are wasted on those who least need it, certainly deserves some grudging admiration. But a swerve late in the series disappointingly sails the story toward calmer waters."
The White Lotus,1,"It's full of characters that one would never choose to spend time with, yet as a whole, the story presents a fascinating spectacle."
The White Lotus,1,"[Murray] Bartlett and [Jennifer] Coolidge emerge early as the show's MVPs though, both offering performances that cater to their theatrical inclinations whilst remaining centred in a tragic truth."
The White Lotus,1,Coolidge combines real pain with laugh-out-loud comedy.
The White Lotus,1,Without ever being over emphatic it is hilariously sardonic. One of the year's best new shows.
The White Lotus,0,"Instead of the series' short run delivering a well-honed critique alongside its murder mystery, the end result feels unsatisfyingly unfinished."
The White Lotus,1,"Go in expecting a pleasing, intelligent, and well-paced romp, one that definitely won't make you miss overseas travel."
The White Lotus,1,"The White Lotus plods through its first episode -- a cringe-worthy luau of misery -- but the longer viewers sit with the show, the better and more engrossing it becomes."
The White Lotus,1,"The generosity with which he watches these folks he's loosed upon us, in this little island on an island in the middle of a glittering sea astride the somewhere-out-there specter of an invisible pandemic, it's what art exists for."
The White Lotus,1,"It's a lot of people to keep track of, yet White's writing and direction intertwines their stories in an ambitious, novelistic manner... But it's Bartlett, a TV veteran long overdue for a hefty part like this, who holds the cast together."
The White Lotus,1,"Alternately hilarious and unsettling, The White Lotus isn't a feel-good watch, but it is a must-watch."
The White Lotus,1,"Mike White returns to HBO with a darkly hilarious, existentially terrifying wealth satire set at a luxury resort."
The White Lotus,1,"A fascinating trick of light that bends its interlocking stories with the kind of impressive dexterity we've come to expect from White. By the time you get used to this show's rhythms, it's already shifted into something else entirely."
The White Lotus,0,"Aside from a subplot involving cultural reparations that doesn't entirely land, it would have been nice to see a bit more exposition about what point ""The White Lotus"" is ultimately trying to make."
The White Lotus,1,"Often funny and always wicked, the series spends its time patiently rending apart the images its characters have of each other."
The White Lotus,1,"A snapshot of awfully rich people doing awfully awful things, White Lotus is delightfully mean-spirited and unexpectedly big-hearted in ways that will probably polarize some audiences. I found it vibrantly messy and deceptively emotional."
The White Lotus,1,"Frequently uncomfortable, sometimes poetic, occasionally hilarious, and deeply idiosyncratic throughout."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"The critical disdain and indifference the show has experienced is its longest, most obsessive running joke, on itself, but also on its detractors. After 12 years, ""The Big Bang Theory"" gets the final ""Bazinga!"""
The Big Bang Theory,1,"I'm going to remember those writing credits, and that little hat tip to the fact that indeed, nobody, not even insanely powerful television showrunners, accomplishes anything alone."
The Big Bang Theory,1,The Big Bang Theory says goodbye with an emotional ending to leave fans with a good taste. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Big Bang Theory,1,It's the end of an era and I am grateful as a fan to have a finale that provided that emotional value as we bid these characters a final farewell.
The Big Bang Theory,1,"There is no BAZINGA. The moment is sweet, sincere, and lovely. I appreciated the low-key ending of a show that started with a big bang."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"However big a role pop culture may have played in its stories, the show itself could never have served as a barometer for the rest of pop culture. It's impossible to be a meaningful barometer if the dial only ever reads one thing."
The Big Bang Theory,1,A drama-filled episode...
The Big Bang Theory,1,"It's mostly fizzling out, compared even to the end of HBO's much-less-watched Veep"
The Big Bang Theory,1,"All in all, a sweet, gentle, kind, sentimental and congenial wrap. Exactly what fans would expect."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"I don't really think the show was about teaching Sheldon Cooper to appreciate friends and to be able to apologize for all of the patience he took advantage of, but if that's how the writers wanted to end construct the finale, I can accept it."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
The Big Bang Theory,1,"The one-hour finish felt satisfying and appropriate, if somewhat low-key, eschewing huge fireworks that which would have likely felt like something of an overreach, to echo what has made the show so popular over the course of its run."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"The series finale of ""The Big Bang Theory"" was everything the show did well, and a bit of what it did poorly, wrapped into one hourlong package."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"As The Big Bang Theory enters its final season, and these characters enter new phases of their lives, there are so many possible stories to tell. It just has to stop telling all the same ones."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"It didn't even feel much like season premiere. Instead, it was exactly what showrunner Steve Holland told TV Guide it would be: a solid episode of The Big Bang Theory."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"[The finale] doesn't create needless drama or focus on characters we don't care about. It zeroes in on the core four (with Howard, Bernadette and Raj as back-up) and gives them the episodic equivalent of a long, warm hug."
The Big Bang Theory,1,"Nicely played, TBBT writers. That's some Larry David-level petard hoisting right there."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet bares herself of all the glamour and movie star glitz to portray this woman. When she accepted this role, she checked her vanity at the door."
Mare of Easttown,1,Easttown is not an ideal place. Mare is not an ideal detective or mom. But both have something more compelling than perfection going for them: they're real.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is not the standard police procedural it seems, with more shocking twists and, thanks to Winslet's performance, empathy for grief than you might expect."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Kate Winslet adds to a long list of magnificent, disappear-into-the-character performances as Mare Sheehan..."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is the show. Her performance is fascinating - powerful, but she never overpowers it. It's a difficult task to make someone want to watch you suffer."
Mare of Easttown,1,"With the aid of an excellent ensemble cast, Kate Winslet inhabits Mare Sheehan and invites viewers to share her journey."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Seriously, I hope Mare Of Easttown returns for some more cases. I probably wouldn't want to live in Easttown. But it's a great place to visit on my TV."
Mare of Easttown,1,Mare of Easttown is the rare crime drama that has actually taken the best lessons from the genre and put them into action.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet never falters, making ""Easttown"" seem like the place she was born, raised and disappointed. Peters and Smart are great sparring partners but Mare is the deserving main attraction. Winslet is the reason."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Elements of ""Mare"" do feel overly familiar, particularly the hard-charging-woman- detective-who's-dedicated-to-the-job-at-the-expense-of-her-family trope. But it's easy to forgive thanks to Winslet's performance and the show's strong supporting cast."
Mare of Easttown,1,A seven-part series whose powers derive as much from its enthralling focus on that town and its society as from the unsteady life and career of its heroine... Kate Winslet's eloquent command of the role is obvious from the outset.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare's courage at confronting the demons of this town offer up a particularly satisfying kind of catharsis, where women paying attention to each other can save each other from the worst kind of bogeyman."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown ultimately yields a better production than the description probably sounds -- proof that with this sort of endeavor, it's not always so much about the ingredients as how you put them together."
Mare of Easttown,1,"The acting -- by Winslet and the strong ensemble around her -- is compelling enough to make it all feel more tragic than soapy, more complex than overcooked."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's a fully rounded portrait of a town, with a female figure at its centre. And Winslet holds it all together with a quietly commanding, note-perfect performance."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Very cool character. Interesting, and further proof of Winslet's extraordinary versatility."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It is impossible here not to mention Jean Smart as Helen, Mare's mother, and if you thought there was no conceivable way that the star of everything from Designing Women to Fargo would be anything but fantastic, you were right."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Its characters are deeply real and expertly drawn, its sense of place firmly established and specific, and its clues genuinely shocking. It's an intense and satisfying to watch, going to places your average murder mystery wouldn't aspire."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Ingelsby and Zobel display an appealingly old-fashioned dedication to characterization and world-building, creating a town where many of the residents have working-class backgrounds."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Wearing her Pennsylvanian American accent, Winslet makes you believe in Mare as a person and not a part; the actress, who spends much of the opening episode limping, does not mind looking bedraggled, and you can feel the world weighing on her."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Thus is the power of a great cast (courtesy of casting director Avy Kaufman) given a meticulous world to play in; credit to Ingelsby, who grew up in the area, and Zobel, for knowing what details to hone in on without overindulging."
Mare of Easttown,1,"A brilliant, bitterly funny Kate Winslet digs deep as a small-town, Pennsylvania detective in HBO's compulsively watchable crime series that is full of twists you won't see coming. Emmy attention must be paid."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare of Easttown is a pleasure to watch, with everyone in Mare's orbit, and vice versa, as she circles in on the show's main mystery."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Mare of Easttown,0,"With the overwhelming variety of ""prestige"" content that exists in every nook and cranny of the internet and beyond right now, Mare of Easttown isn't exactly appointment television."
Mare of Easttown,1,I am invested in finding out Who Did It. Just know that the mystery moves at a glacial pace. The material strains for twisted Opioid Gothic social resonance.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light."
Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Every performance here works, which is a great credit to Zobel for tying these characters together in a way that makes the supporting players seem like actual locals with full lives."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Great acting can be contagious, and here it's tucked into every dark corner and secret. You don't just watch ""Mare of Easttown."" You live in its shadows."
Mare of Easttown,1,"If Winslet doesn't likewise figure in awards contention for this role I'll be astonished. She is absolutely superb - by turns funny, fierce and infuriating -- in what surely counts as an acting masterclass."
Mare of Easttown,1,The series leaves no police procedural cliché untouched but ultimately transcends its familiarity.
Mare of Easttown,1,"Even though the performances, direction, and other technical aspects of the show are top-notch, it's a tough watch whose early to middle chapters don't provide the kind of emotional catharsis that justifies all the hardship."
Mare of Easttown,1,"""Mare of Easttown"" isn't the feel-good show of the spring season, and is dark, dirty, and depressing, but its soulfulness offers an unmistakable sentiment of hope that's hard to combat."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Even if it were just a basic crime drama, Mare of Easttown would be pretty good... But this seven-episode saga is more than just a gasp-inducer."
Mare of Easttown,1,It's the perfect mix of genre and drama and an exemplary encapsulation of why the prestige limited series might be the best format for adult storytelling we have right now.
Mare of Easttown,0,"More than halfway through the series, there's barely any momentum to the mystery, and the relationship drama is sprawling and unfocused."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is fantastic as Mare. If you ever thought that the actress would be great as a fearless yet somewhat closed-off detective solving murders, you're absolutely correct."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Although the tormented cop trope is hardly new, the show's opening episodes are utterly absorbing, cleverly drawing us into the central mystery and into the sprawling ensemble's tangled personal lives, which are equally, if not more compelling."
Mare of Easttown,1,"At its best the series gives Winslet space to deliver a performance that resists fireworks in favor of flickering doubts, insecurities and concerns... Soon, you'll be most closely watching her when she's doing a million things silently."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Mare sets the scene so vividly that the murder mystery almost isn't even necessary. These characters, and this town, are enough to command our attention."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Whatever happens in the episodes to come, at its heart Mare of Easttown is the story of a fierce, ordinary heroine, beautifully played. No fright wigs, no prosthetics. No need."
Mare of Easttown,1,"For all its unevenness, Mare of Easttown's strengths carry it through its many muddles."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Winslet is in stunning form as the put upon but never downtrodden cop and matriarch, and it's a role which suits her amazing ability to simultaneously dominate the screen with a character."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It's commendably ambitious but the plot elements sometimes work against each other - too baggy to be a compelling crime thriller, too busy to flesh out all the characters - to make it truly satisfying."
Mare of Easttown,1,"""I know you're worth saving,"" a character tells Mare at one of her lowest points. We should all be lucky enough to have someone say those words to us someday."
Mare of Easttown,1,"Led by the always amazing Kate Winslet, this is a series that will have you less focused on solving the whodunit and more on experiencing the lives of these characters."
The Baby,1,"The premise is unique and pays off oddly well, especially being presented as a horror-comedy.  Suspense and witty dialogue will have viewers laughing one moment and creeped out the next."
The Baby,1,"Does with horror something similar to what many contemporary narratives, starting with Jordan Peele's 'black terror' style, do: turns it into a metaphor for trauma. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Baby,1,A simple yet rich premise that signals traditionally ignored problems surrounding motherhood. [Full review in Spanish]
The Baby,1,The Baby’s best work is its commentary on the tribulations surrounding parenthood.
The Baby,1,"What The Baby so excellently shows is that experiences in pregnancy, birth, and parenthood aren’t universal."
The Baby,1,"It all sounds weird, and it is. But this “Baby” knows how to deliver on its premise and its promise."
The Baby,1,"The Baby, even at its weirdest, unpacks the cause and effect of Natasha’s fears without sacrificing who the character is. As off-putting as it can be, it’s refreshing to hear a female character say some of the things she does."
The Baby,1,"There’s a lot to admire here. De Swarte is utterly compelling as the in-charge and exasperated woman who is never, ever going to fall for this baby’s charms."
The Baby,1,It’s more than just fun -- it’s also a whole lot smarter and more thought-provoking than most of the shows sucking up all the attention this month.
The Baby,1,"The Baby is a dark comedy with the emphasis on the dark part, but as the secrets of this creepy baby are revealed, the show should become more interesting to watch."
The Baby,1,"The Baby does its best to make all of these ideas stick together, but this season feels like it works better in individual pieces than it does together."
The Baby,0,The best thing about HBO’s eight-part British horror comedy The Baby is that it rarely exceeds thirty minutes per episode. The worst thing about The Baby is that it’s a TV series at all.
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
The Baby,1,"The Baby is an excellent little limited series, a tense thriller with enough humor to take (some) of the edge off."
The Baby,1,This enjoyable half-hour horror-comedy series has well-drawn characters providing low-level chuckles and solid validation for the anti-natalist crowd.
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
The Baby,1,"The way the show is put together, from the performances to the score to the direction -- which especially works overtime on both sides of the horror-comedy coin -- allows for it to work as an effective piece of storytelling instead of a parody."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
The Baby,1,"A clever, low-key horror comedy that (at its best) matches a helter-skelter rhythm with pinpoint satire, it is also an exploration of the wages of motherhood..."
The Baby,1,"It's best, I think, to go in knowing as little as possible – the better to enjoy and be bewildered by the mystery of it all."
The Baby,1,"While the first episode takes a bit of time to get going, once it does it’s clear there’s some “Servant”-like dark fun to be had watching this “Baby.”"
The Baby,1,Creators Robins-Grace and Gaymer are making more than just a feminist statement about the burdons put upon parents (moms). They have also found a smart way to look at the discussions of generational trauma.
Watchmen,1,"Like a perfectly crafted watch, Watchmen is a masterclass around story structure. It becomes nearly perfect at its mid-point, only to break our own minds in its revolving connectivity to real history. Simply incredible. [Full review in Spanish]"
Watchmen,1,"Despite the Emmys, the world has yet to really acknowledge the obvious: streaming series dont get better than Watchmen, one of the greatest shows of all time."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen somehow spun a nearly four-decades-old comic franchise rapidly into the 2020s, asking questions about nostalgia, inherited tragedy, and race and authority in America."
Watchmen,1,"Moore would disagree, but HBO's Watchmen is a bona fide sequel to the source material that despite telling a fresh story with (mostly) new characters stays true to the spirit of the original."
Watchmen,1,"No show speaks to our time better than ""Watchmen"" with themes of police brutality and white supremacy set against the Tulsa Massacre."
Watchmen,1,"One of the best TV series of 2019, with an incredibly fierce and memorable performance from Regina King!"
Watchmen,1,"Fans of Moore's book will not be disappointed, while a new generation not familiar with its characters or the story should be inspired too."
Watchmen,1,Watchmen centers Black trauma in a way few other shows have and follows the inherited pain of Black Americans through decades of oppression.
Watchmen,1,"Showrunner Damon Lindelof has pulled off a thermo-dynamic miracle, not unlike turning lead into gold."
Watchmen,1,Watchmen puts disparate things next to each other and admirably eschews didacticism by asking us to decide the relationship between them....
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen remains magnetic in the moment of watching it. The production values are sky-high, and the score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor is divine."
Watchmen,1,"The most surprising thing after six episodes is how much the show comes to feel like a funhouse mirror reflection of our own world. The proportions are all wrong, but the underlying identity is still the same."
Watchmen,1,"A fantastic entry into the world of ""different superhero stuff"". [Full review in Spanish]."
Watchmen,1,"Because Lindelof doesn't confuse fidelity with loyalty, and is not afraid to manifest his own contemporary voice, he finally manages to capture Moore's spirit. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is not just a deconstruction; it is a celebration of what superheroes can be, and you have to love comics to be able to create content like that."
Watchmen,0,"There's a lot going on in Watchmen. Actually, there's too much, a surplus of narrative, too many three-minute set pieces that don't advance the story, and way, way too many flashbacks."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen encapsulates the weariness of Black America, our wounds healing just enough for the scabs to be torn off again."
Watchmen,1,HBO's Watchmen embraces Alan Moore's original vision while forging its own path.
Watchmen,1,"I can't begin to go into the smart, mind-bending complications the show, created by Damon Lindelof, detonates. But it's an example of our current golden age of television."
Watchmen,1,Regina King is fantastic.
Watchmen,1,Damon Lindelof manages to make fit all the relevant pieces creating a work that gives us the feeling of completeness. [Full review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,"This show transcends more than time, it transcends boundaries, it breaks the nerd ceiling and transports people into the narrative just beyond Jupiter - and people are not scared whatsoever of the climate and new world."
Watchmen,1,"By honoring the past, but moving the property forward, the new Watchmen, created by Damon Lindelof, became one of the year's best television series."
Watchmen,1,"It works perfectly, and presents a linear continuation of the world created by Moore and Gibbons."
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof has turned it into a stunningly cinematic look at white supremacy, policing and race in the US. Watchmen is mystifying but hugely entertaining, if deeply troubling."
Watchmen,1,An inventive and complex series. [Full Review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,Never did I think a show that discusses inter-dimensional squid-beings would also create poignant commentary about America's violent racist history and how that trauma is carried on through generations.
Watchmen,0,On a technical level it also leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,"I think the lead, Regina King, is one of the finest of American actors..."
Watchmen,1,"In Watchmen, blackness is the root of the story, as well as its underlying purpose: it's a show about the potential for pop culture to treat black identity as a default..."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is deeply steeped in black history, existential musings, politics, and otherworldliness, each scene containing a plethora of references/odes to the original."
Watchmen,1,"By making this Watchmen distinctly American, the alternate reality feels far more grounded in the ""what could be"" than a straight adaptation would have managed."
Watchmen,1,"It's easy to be wowed by Watchmen, but that doesn't necessarily make it wondrous."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is a puzzle with a paranoid contemporary side. These days, political extremists make dark threats of Civil War II; on the show, as in real life, the masks are coming off."
Watchmen,1,"Show-runner Damon Lindelof has created a narrative with roots so firmly implanted in the original text, the lore has become fertilised with incredible fecundity."
Watchmen,1,"Damon Lindelof's over-plotted, over-anxious, daring, genre-hopping offshoot is less about hunting down the bad guys than the twisted turns and stubborn legacies of racist trauma."
Watchmen,1,"It is dark, it is gritty, and it totally throws unexpected twists at you. I can only hope that it continues down the same path."
Watchmen,1,What's particularly fascinating about the beginning of Watchmen is how it doesn't lean too much into the science-fiction aspect of the world.
Watchmen,1,"It's the visionary production details that work so, so well."
Watchmen,1,"It seems though that the more characters we meet, the less we can trust any of them all...It is anyone's game."
Watchmen,1,"If you've never read ""Watchmen,"" you will still enjoy the fearlessness of the show, which wrestles with some of the biggest problems in modern American society in truly audacious fashion any may even go on to surpass the original."
Watchmen,1,Fans of the original comic will wait fascinated for the development of the story. Those who are discovering Watchmen for the first time will have to wait for additional clues to figure out the puzzle built by Lindelof. [Full Review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,"Mercifully, the resulting drama... is nothing short of a triumph."
Watchmen,1,"The pilot's best flourishes, in fact, come from pure invention."
Watchmen,1,"Sunday night on HBO, I saw something I thought I'd never see on television: the depiction of a dark day in American history that not many know about-the Tulsa massacre."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is a bold, cracked collage about identity, morality, and the broken culture around us and is perhaps some of the best of both worlds balance between the mysterious and the humane, Lindelof has crafted thus far."
Watchmen,1,"Meta-superhero show is deep, violent, challenging."
Watchmen,1,"[It] unfolds in the way a giant jigsaw puzzle gets put together, with isolated fragments of the bigger picture being revealed bit by bit. It's a genuinely thrilling thing to witness as the series progresses."
Watchmen,1,The most admirable thing about Lindelof's Watchmen is that it channels the spirit of the original comic without merely rehashing it.
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen's aesthetic is neither pointedly unglamorous nor cartoonishly heightened, but somewhere in the dreamlike space between."
Watchmen,1,"Based on the episodes I've seen, it's too early to tell whether Lindelof can make the show's enigmas pay off in a satisfying way, but so far, I'm ready to give him the chance."
Watchmen,1,A stupendous and intelligent addition to the mythical lore. [Full Review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,"Get ready for eight episodes of mystery, drama, violence, and, most of all, a political thriller that holds a mirror up to our world and asks us to take a good, long look at what we've created."
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof's work will either add up to the coolest, most intricate dramatic series this side of Westworld or the biggest swing-and-a-miss in recent television history."
Watchmen,1,"From squid storms thanks to Adrian Veidt (you'll have to do a bit of background research into that one), to horrific gun fights under a lookalike Owlship, it's a harrowing tone overall, which is a suitable homage to past Watchmen material."
Watchmen,1,"Johnson was craggily charismatic. King was brilliantly fiery. The actions scenes thrilled, the rest intrigued and killing off a major character straight away was a bold way to grab attention. Has Watchmen's hour of screen glory finally arrived?"
Watchmen,1,This is one of many confident flourishes with which showrunner Damon Lindelof demonstrates his joy in and mastery of his own material and its origins.
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof's show is a marriage of pulpy mythmaking and grim reality, telling a weighty story under the guise of mass-market entertainment."
Watchmen,1,"This ""Watchmen"" forces the perspective on viewers that real-world racism is more bizarre, more horrifying, than a TV series could possibly re-imagine."
Watchmen,1,"Will Watchmen catch on with a cold audience? Who knows, but this opener was slick and engrossing."
Watchmen,1,Lindelof... leaves [viewers] surprised and wanting more. [Full review in Spanish]
Watchmen,1,"Weird, weird, weird, but definitely not boring."
Watchmen,1,"This is a big-budget, high-profile production that declares its presence. You can't ignore it and you wouldn't want to because it's extremely compulsive viewing."
Watchmen,1,"A haunting end to Watchmen's season 1 debut. But, it does bring ""Running Out of Ice's"" chilling cold open full circle."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen paints a chilling portrait of politically and racially divided 21st-century life, and those on both sides of the aisle will find much to like and loathe...moreover, it's overflowing with phenomenal performances."
Watchmen,1,"...by the time Jean Smart enters in episode three, you know I was on board, full-stop."
Watchmen,1,"A potent but rarely heavy-handed metaphor for race relations in America and a showcase for one of the greatest actors of her generation, it is also a shrewd encapsulation of the perils that might await a society obsessed with superheroes."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is a thrilling and scintillating series that is sure to find armies of fans, old and new, who will undoubtedly be besotted."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen seems like an attempt to blend the existentially weighty themes of The Leftovers with the poppier tones of Lost. For the most part, it succeeds."
Watchmen,1,"The most genius part of HBO's Watchmen is that while the story is a new one, the structure will feel familiar, and the themes don't stray too terribly far from Moore's book."
Watchmen,1,"Sublime and absurd. It's a symphony in which the loudest note in every bar is proudly out of key. The plane it portrays, an alternative-history America in 2019, is at once disturbingly peculiar and unmistakably our own."
Watchmen,1,This Watchmen is more a fierce blaze than the slow burn that too often exemplifies current prestige television.
Watchmen,1,"The sucker punch that Watchmen pulls off is an impressive one, immediately establishing the show as one set to be the cherry on top of HBO's banner year of post-Thrones programming."
Watchmen,1,"Visually entrancing, pointedly provocative and all over the place in time and space, Watchmen might make even David Lynch drop his jaw at times."
Watchmen,1,"It is the powerful allusions to our contemporary predicaments that make ""Watchmen"" work best even when the storylines get muddled. What matters is what these masked archetypes represent."
Watchmen,1,"It is dark, but it's also exciting; grim, but also invigorating. The action sequences are stunning, as are the performances."
Watchmen,1,"No previous experience required, thanks to Lindelof and his team's own compelling approach to world-building. Just show up, and you're ready for the thrilling ride through deeply fascinating territory."
Watchmen,1,Damon Lindelof has taken a beloved property and made something new and fresh.
Watchmen,1,Watchmen reaffirms Damon Lindelof's stature as one of the greatest creators to have ever worked in television. Writers can spend their entire careers creating something that isn't half as special as even one of his shows; Lindelof has made three.
Watchmen,1,"It's dense, odd, thrilling and thoughtful, and it's much closer to Westworld's headspinning sci-fi complexity than the colourful comic book action of Marvel."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is grandiose, political, and cinematic television, with epic blockbuster action scenes and standout performances from its ensemble, including from leading lady Regina King."
Watchmen,1,"A phenomenal cast, fantastic stunt choreography, and a societal and historically relevant narrative which is compelling enough to encourage more. While there may be commentary on The Comedian here, Watchmen on HBO is anything but a joke."
Watchmen,1,"I have no idea where it's going, but I want to see it get there."
Watchmen,1,"An energetic, unruly show with a very concise and ambitious objective."
Watchmen,1,"Successfully entertaining, without being as thought-provoking as the showrunner undoubtedly hoped."
Watchmen,1,"There's the persistent sense of narrative freefall you get when almost anything implausible can happen, and usually does, but Regina King anchors it all with passion and purpose."
Watchmen,1,"I'm still not sure Lindelof is wholly in control of the subject. But he earns the chance to show that he has a thought-through long game, that he's working with something more than magic dust and good intentions."
Watchmen,1,"The best new TV show of 2019, Watchmen is the sequel we've been waiting for and a gripping piece of television it's impossible to look away from."
Watchmen,1,"It's a wondrous, often funny, engaging sight to behold, two pros at the top of their game - two women over 40 taking the reins in what could be reductively called a ""comic book show."""
Watchmen,1,"Shockingly, this new Watchmen is not only good, not only great, it is absolutely necessary... HBO's Watchmen is just that insightful, invigorating and essential."
Watchmen,1,"The series argues the ways injustice might persist, and in that sense, its alternate history doesn't look so alien after all."
Watchmen,0,"Whether you're a student of the graphic novel or coming to the series without prior knowledge of Moore and Gibbons' work, HBO's ""Watchmen"" is likely to leave you feeling less than super."
Watchmen,1,There are few series that will challenge viewers in the way that Watchmen will. Watchmen feels like the first true successor to Game of Thrones and could easily eclipse Westworld as the network's best drama.
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is a poignant mental and visual feast that asks heavy questions in a fascinating alternate Earth history, brought to glorious life by tremendous cast performances."
Watchmen,1,"The show is so ambitious, with its multiple timelines, storytelling structures, and perspectives, that it's perpetually surprising."
Watchmen,1,"Though the comic inspires this level of devotion, Lindelof's Watchmen is great precisely because it rarely gives in to that impulse: If Watchmen has a foundational rule, it's that no one is ever cool."
Watchmen,1,"You may not always be sure what you're watching, but good luck taking your eyes off Watchmen."
Watchmen,1,It's fabulous and flammable and feels exactly right.
Watchmen,1,Watchmen kicks the post-Game of Thrones era of HBO off with a thrilling and fearless start.
Watchmen,1,"It's easy to imagine viewers who aren't already invested in the very idea of a Watchmen sequel growing impatient with the show's gradual doling out of exposition... Still, the sheer nerve of the thing is admirable."
Watchmen,1,"By incorporating the deeply entrenched roots of America's racist past, present, and future, and running it through Alan Moore' brand of chaos magick anarchic wizardry, Watchmen puts on a new mask but the face behind it remains the same."
Watchmen,1,"The cast is owed a lot of credit for keeping the momentum going and the series grounded. King contains multitudes-as the de facto lead, she is capable of great compassion and anger in her quest for justice, which is complicated by her years on the force."
Watchmen,1,"This is breathtaking, ambitious television that only gets richer with each subsequent episode."
Watchmen,1,"Not all of it works, but it's a fascinating -- and frequently thrilling -- attempt to rebottle some of the same lightning that Moore and Gibbons unleashed back in the Eighties."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen pushes the envelope of the superhero genre, in better, more successful ways than what has been claimed of other adaptations this year."
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof calls his Watchmen a remix, but it might be more accurate to refer to it as a re-contextualization; a funhouse mirror in which the uncanny reflection is disturbingly familiar."
Watchmen,1,"Bold, breathtaking, and polarizing, Watchmen is a triumph."
Watchmen,1,"Presents its own kind of Rorschach test: Occasionally frustrating and meandering, it's never less than interesting, although that appeal might not extend much beyond acolytes of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' dark superhero tale."
Watchmen,1,"The thematic throughline of the past's haunting echoes and tangible consequences can get hammy at times, but it's still a fascinating concept for a sequel series that nobody asked for."
Watchmen,1,"Overall, [Damon] Lindelof's Watchmen embraces the spirit of the original comic with its stylish cynicism while attempting to erect a new organizing principle all its own, which will prove controversial to some."
Watchmen,1,"The series' scope is astonishing given its subject matter, and even more so given its relentless entertainment value."
Watchmen,0,"Lindelof keeps scribbling in the margins, adding in more and more story that may yet pay off but that takes perhaps undue patience in the interim."
Watchmen,1,"Lindelof's Watchmen is bold, creative and challenging, maintaining a faithfulness to the source material, or its spirit, at least, without being overly reverential... It's fully realized, engaging and, yes, weird, but in all of the right ways (squidfall!)"
Watchmen,1,"So much energy as is spent on the sociopolitical elements of the series, but ""Watchmen"" is at its best when it tries a little less hard to be profound and instead focuses on the fascinating and deep cast of characters."
Watchmen,1,"Its greatest rewards are the strength of its perspective, the depth of its humanity, and the risky creative swings it takes to create an entirely new story that also feels right at home in the world of Watchmen."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen doesn't overdose on nostalgia, like so many franchise extensions in our reboot-soaked decade. It's dangerous, and invigorating. Like the proverbial Space Squid, it blew my mind."
Watchmen,1,"Watchmen is a tour-de-force, no doubt, but there's a landing that definitely needs to be stuck."
Watchmen,1,"The book gives anyone attempting to follow it up a richly realized world on which to build, but it's the ways in which this new series diverges from the source material that makes it so compelling"
Watchmen,1,"Hard to know where this will go, but the pilot is certainly dazzling and bold."
Big Little Lies,1,"Characterization trumps plot twists every time, and the series is better for it. Above all else, the show explores the pain that families inflict on one another."
Big Little Lies,1,"Big Little Lies' depiction of domestic violence and trauma is so powerful precisely because it allows its leads to be more than victims, more than wives, more than mothers."
Big Little Lies,1,"Yet for all the series' careful, at times heartrending attention to the nuances of trauma, misogyny, and emotional dissatisfaction, the distinctive pleasure of Big Little Lies also resides in its soapiness."
Big Little Lies,1,"Creating a second season was risky business. But fortunately, it works."
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
Big Little Lies,0,The final episode seems to emerge from a lack of ideas about how to get these five women together again in the same room. It just doesn't work. [Full Review in Spanish]
Big Little Lies,0,"A lot feels unrealistic here. Celeste is in therapy, but her kids, who are fighting all the time, are not. And characters drop lines that underline their every feeling, as if the audience wouldn't get it otherwise."
Big Little Lies,1,It's a great revisit to these gang of powerful women undergoing scrutiny for something necessary. Wonderful additions and a light story are enough for a new season. [Full review in Spanish].
Big Little Lies,0,"As the fans thirst for a THIRD season of this show, I beg them (and the powers that be at HBO) to please let it end. One season was amazing, two seasons was questionable, a third would be a downright terrible idea."
Big Little Lies,0,"HBO, determined to win some more Emmys, and replicate the lighting-in-a-bottle brilliance that was season one, made a season that fails to justify its existence."
Big Little Lies,1,"Forget Mies van der Rohe. Sometimes you have to listen to Cecil B. DeMille. In other words, less isn't always more; sometimes only more is more."
Big Little Lies,1,"If a little disappointing in terms of story, the second season of Big Little Lies was consistently invigorating through the power of its cast."
Big Little Lies,0,Season two's biggest shortcoming is the way it prioritized Mary-Louise at the expense of Bonnie.
Big Little Lies,0,A melodrama that didn't have the courage to go the full camp; that puttered and faltered and finally fell over the Californian cliffs and into the sea.
Big Little Lies,1,"It was the mother of all TV blockbuster finales, with one explosive secret revealed after another."
Big Little Lies,1,"Though the actresses on the series did a tremendous job with the often underwritten material they were given, the series did not deliver on the promises it set up in Season One."
Big Little Lies,1,"""If we do a season two, we'll break that beautiful thing and spoil it."" - Jean-Marc Vallée, director, Big Little Lies season 1."
Big Little Lies,1,"Season two wasn't unwatchable; in fact, despite many nonsensical developments, it was compelling because of the returning cast plus Streep... [But] it did need saving."
Big Little Lies,0,"With more empathetic writing, Bonnie could have been the emotional anchor of season two."
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
Big Little Lies,1,Big Little Lies is a must-see - again.
Big Little Lies,0,"Big Little Lies will never be without its pleasures. But this season, those pleasures feel divided."
Big Little Lies,1,"By introducing a detective into an already-solved mystery, the show subverts the genre itself, eating away at the happy ending ""solution"" with the gnawing hunger of a grief that will not be satisfied."
Big Little Lies,1,"What I appreciate about this season of Big Little Lies is its messiness; it feels undone somehow, and ragged. It's harder on its characters; it doesn't coddle them in cashmere but shoves them right into the deep end."
Big Little Lies,1,There are more secrets and more shame. It should be fun to see how it all plays out.
Big Little Lies,1,Its nuanced look at the ways that domestic violence can remain hidden from public view is one of the series' most important additions to the cultural conversation.
Big Little Lies,0,"By leaning into exaggeration this season, though, Big Little Lies has made its more sober elements feel like afterthoughts to jokes about the ridiculousness of Californians and self-absorbed stay-at-home moms."
Big Little Lies,1,The misery of beautiful people continues to be a moral as well as aesthetic pleasure as Big Little Lies continues its second series.
Big Little Lies,1,What an excellent first episode; out of the traps like a greyhound and with great dialogue - no second series slump here.
Big Little Lies,1,"If the show isn't the singular masterpiece of the first season, that's because that season was truly meant to be singular. But coming close to meeting a bar set that high is still worth toasting with a glass of champagne over a gorgeous fire pit."
Big Little Lies,1,Episode one came charging out of the traps with a glint in its eye and vengeance in its heart.
Big Little Lies,1,"It's unclear what new conflicts the women will get themselves embroiled in, but from the first episode, it'll obviously be a fun ride."
Big Little Lies,1,"Meryl Streep plays Mary Louise, and of course, well she is Meryl Streep and the acting is fabulous. Her grief over a son she thought was perfect is illustrated in a very real way."
Big Little Lies,1,"It was as good as any drama I have seen in the past decade, and still is. I just hope it goes somewhere new too."
Big Little Lies,1,"With [Meryl] Streep on board, we're guaranteed for an exciting Season 2."
Big Little Lies,1,The women are so vividly drawn and so arrestingly played by such a stellar cast.
Big Little Lies,1,The early episodes of Big Little Lies suggest a masterful extension as the key characters are given meaty storylines to work with.
Big Little Lies,0,"No one's been handed anything approaching as good a storyline as Streep, not yet - Bonnie's whole narrative is now ""walking"", which gives Zoë Kravitz nothing to work with."
Big Little Lies,1,Wonderfully watchable.
Big Little Lies,1,Big Little Lies might have more petrol left in the tank
Big Little Lies,1,"Beyond the staggering strength of the actresses on screen and talent behind the camera, there's a story of friendship, found comraderies in the spirits of women and general intrigue and drama that keeps us looking forward to what is going to happen next."
Big Little Lies,1,The entire second season works better than it has any right to...
Big Little Lies,1,[Meryl] Streep's scenes with [Reese] Witherspoon and [Nicole] Kidman are high camp played in deliciously low key style.
Big Little Lies,1,A second season was a creative risk. But so far that decision to continue the story is one well worth following.
Big Little Lies,0,"In under an hour, the finale reiterated what most of us were too afraid to admit: The charm of Big Little Lies was in it being a mini-series."
Big Little Lies,1,The second season of 'Big Little Lies' shows a world in which everything has changed but you must pretend that it hasn't. [Full Review in Spanish]
Big Little Lies,1,I'm still not sure I can say that the return of Big Little Lies is altogether necessary. But I can say that it promises to be thoroughly enjoyable and smart.
Big Little Lies,1,"Although Big Little Lies doesn't seem entirely sure of where it's headed, it can still work itself up into a delectably roiling state of privilege and anger."
Big Little Lies,1,"Through it all, the signature Big Little Lies approach is in full effect: sharply observed, endlessly patient, emotionally true."
Big Little Lies,1,Big Little Lies has taken the fallout of trauma and made it the most engrossing thing on television right now and you should definitely be here for it.
Big Little Lies,1,"That first season was perfect television and this second season, while promising, already lacks the kind of stakes that existed in the first. But we shall see."
Big Little Lies,1,The series justifies its existence with a compelling story and the addition of Meryl Streep to an already absurdly talented cast.
Big Little Lies,1,"Rather than running out of gas in its second season, Big Little Lies is more deliciously watchable than ever."
Big Little Lies,1,"It's crazy funny, scary and disquieting. And it's about as must-watch as anything on TV."
Big Little Lies,1,[Meryl] Streep gives Mary Louise a vicious and eerily hilarious maternal edge. She is clearly having a ball. I can't wait to see how her story line expands.
Big Little Lies,0,"As good as the cast was, they couldn't quite lift Big Little Lies above the ordinary."
Big Little Lies,1,"Whatever your expectations are, double them, because [Meryl] Streep is stunning as Perry's mother Mary-Louise."
Big Little Lies,1,"What's behind the sunshine and smiles? If the first three episodes of this second season are any indication, what's waiting is another exceedingly wicked, exceedingly adult ride through riveting territory."
Big Little Lies,1,"In Season 2 Big Little Lies, has become The Real Housewives of Prozac Nation."
Big Little Lies,1,"With soft furnishings so gorgeous that you could weep, Instagram-hued vistas and school runs drenched in guilt and paranoia, Big Little Lies has returned with all its winning attributes intact."
Big Little Lies,1,"Happily enough these first few episodes are just as engrossing as those that came before. Scenes rapidly fluctuate from concerning to hilarious, but keeping up with the pace is no problem: This emotional roller coaster is far too fun."
Big Little Lies,1,"That's ultimately the fun of Big Little Lies 2: The Streepening, which seems to have much lower stakes than the first season."
Big Little Lies,1,"Big Little Lies started out with an embarrassment of riches, and season two offers more of the same, generously giving fans everything they could want and then some."
Big Little Lies,1,"Electric with snappy dialogue, visual splendor, and genuinely remarkable performances, Big Little Lies Season 2 is still the sensual, gripping high-camp that we all fell in love with, but a bit older and wiser."
Big Little Lies,1,"As in season one of the Emmy-award winning series in 2017, the scenery, the music and the girl talk are selling points for season two. But the primary reason to watch this time is Meryl Streep."
Big Little Lies,1,"No matter how tiny the performance dosage in a scene or episode, [Streep] leaves the whole thing somehow charged with her presence long after she has vanished into the wings. You can believe the very molecules of the air are still humming with her memory."
Big Little Lies,1,"One of the show's strengths is the way its characters and actresses range from extremely realistic to over-the-top, creating an engaging mix."
Big Little Lies,1,"In its second season, Big Little Lies remains the same moody suspense-drama that fans fell in love with during its initial run."
Big Little Lies,1,"Some adaptations from strong bestsellers need not go on, because the wealth of the story was mined the first time around. But this new season of ""Big Little Lies"" proves there are more, dark riches to be had."
Big Little Lies,1,"Those who love this series are likely to love these new hours just as well. As for we few who weren't entirely swept up, one can't quite say there isn't enough of a story to merit a new season of this drama."
Big Little Lies,1,"If you're looking for a rigorous, credible storyline, maybe Big Little Lies isn't for you. If, however, you are interested in watching six of the greatest actresses alive swing for the fences, get ready for a very enjoyable seven episodes."
Big Little Lies,1,"Whatever word you choose to describe ""Big Little Lies,"" the new season looks to be just as addictive as the first."
Big Little Lies,1,"My overall reaction...of the new season made available by HBO was laughter rather than horror, and what a relief it was."
Big Little Lies,1,"It's harder now to ignore, watching the early episodes of Season Two, that Big Little Lies is offering up some of the best psychological storytelling on television."
Big Little Lies,1,"It looks great, sounds great, and is populated with some of the best actors on a very crowded planet."
Big Little Lies,1,"It's a visual idiom that sure sizzles, making the natural setting and the homes both captivating and unnerving. What is also here in the continuation is a fabulous sense of humour. There are scenes of exquisite dry hilarity."
Big Little Lies,1,"The show appears to be exchanging an all-consuming, incendiary mystery for a tale that's less mercurial but no less hearty, and it's still an absolute pleasure to watch."
Big Little Lies,1,"This season obviously abandons the whodunit format and zeroes in on the emotional aftermath. The necessary change-up works well, keeps things fresh, and delivers more upper-crust theatrics from HBO's ""limited series"" that keeps on going."
Big Little Lies,1,"Though its focus is more scattered this time around, Big Little Lies recaptures much of the magic of the first season, especially in the performances."
Big Little Lies,1,"The series is strongest when it highlights the struggles of these complex women, who are all trying to live fulfilling lives and raise children in a competitive community."
Big Little Lies,0,"The new episodes flirted with exploring the effects of trauma, but the writers shrugged when it came to finding a deeper meaning to suffering than that it simply sucks."
Big Little Lies,1,"There's simply not enough conflict here to justify extending the series, even if it remains as watchable as ever, particularly for audiences drawn to the bitchy lives of these rich, entitled white women."
Big Little Lies,1,"""Big Little Lies"" continues to offer the sharp, dark-comedic observations that made the first season one of the great thrills of 2017."
Big Little Lies,1,Almost everything about season one that was overwrought and overdone has been ratcheted down. What was given insufficient exposure has been ratcheted up. And what's entirely new to the game -- namely Meryl Streep -- is close to perfection.
Big Little Lies,1,"Sporting vaguely rodential teeth, Streep is effortlessly dominating as Mary Louise, the dead man's grieving, slyly aggressive mother, who doubts the official version of her son's death and refuses to believe he was a sexual thug."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Big Little Lies,0,"It's simple enough to write off Season 2 as a novel if unsuccessful experiment -- one that was watchable enough and delivered strong moments, without making a convincing case for its own existence."
Big Little Lies,1,"Big Little Lies returns with the same expert dissection of a Northern California beach community's exquisite grappling with wealth, grief, hyperactive parenting and general dissatisfaction."
Big Little Lies,1,"At its best, Big Little Lies offers significant insight into darkest desires of the well to do. Nobody is perfect, this cast of characters plays well into that imperfection."
Big Little Lies,1,(The second season) moves at a quicker pace and an emphasis on dark humor thanks largely to the arrival of Meryl Streep as Mary Louise
Big Little Lies,1,"While it may lack some of the bite and urgency of its first season thus far, Big Little Lies is still an absolutely gorgeous series with a lot to unpack in terms of its complex women."
Big Little Lies,1,"The characters' inner emotional lives still drive the story, abiding by another old show biz rule, that if the characters are true to themselves, then the story will be true to them."
Big Little Lies,1,"Occasionally it feels like the gorgeous visuals and major talent on display are there primarily to distract us from the fact this is really just a superior soap. But for the most part, Big Little Lies is an engaging thriller..."
Big Little Lies,1,"There's a lot to enjoy, though. Director Andrea Arnold crafts a complicated portrait of women trying (maybe failing?) to get along."
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Big Little Lies,1,"Talent doesn't solve every problem -- and there are definitely some bumps and stumbles as BLL reopens a formerly close-ended story -- but when you can throw this staggering amount of talent at them, problems become much harder to notice."
Big Little Lies,1,The suburban satire has a blunter edge when things fall apart: Panicked parents attack the school for worrying their kids about climate change - as if that's what's causing them stress.
Big Little Lies,1,"If the show isn't the singular masterpiece of the first season, that's because that season was truly meant to be singular. But coming close to a bar set that high is still worth toasting with a glass of champagne over a gorgeous fire pit."
Big Little Lies,1,"It's far more interested in sifting through the visceral aftermath and continuing to untangle the ferocious knots of shame, fury, and melancholy strangling just about everyone - whether they want to admit it or not."
Big Little Lies,1,"...still snappy, but it's missing a bit of desperate, secretive anger that made Season 1 so addicting."
Big Little Lies,1,'Big Little Lies' returns with strength into its second season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
Big Little Lies,1,We hit the ground running with such force you might want to fasten your seatbelts.
Big Little Lies,1,"You want an actor that can make titans like Witherspoon, Kidman and Dern weak in the knees, you send in Meryl Streep."
Big Little Lies,1,"For all these titans, though, Streep walks on-screen and instantly the show's gravity changes."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Has its share of problems and a clear disdain for facts, but there’s enough reasons to be optimistic that the series can be a contender."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"A bawdy, untethered, stealthily political dramatization of the Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Like Magic, may it run and run."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"For all its super stellar glamour and the exquisite Seventies and Eighties production design that’s very à la mode, Winning Time is just a whirlwind of benign energy."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,There is some good stuff here.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,It is a touch superficial... but it is a lot of fun.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"It doesn’t take knowing a three pointer from a driving manoeuvre to find that story compelling, especially when told in this punchy, pacy manner."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay’s hodgepodge of postmodern filmmaking deprives the audience of any sense of discovery.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Not since Bohemian Rhapsody have we seen scenes so poorly edited.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Only an actor as likable as Reilly can make such a philandering, narcissistic individual like Jerry Buss redeemable."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Messy, flashy fun."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Winning Time: The Rise of Lakers Dynasty is Big: Big noise, Big names, Big twists, Big moves and most importantly, Big Fun."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Totally over the top, just like it should be."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,It’s a style that works well for this story.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Winning Time moves like lightning and keeps you always on your toes, but as for that moment when the buzzer rings out just as someone hooks one last hail Mary shot at the hoop Your breath might not catch in your throat."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Basketball fans might get restless waiting for the story to make it to the title run, but those less familiar with the yarn will enjoy all the off-court antics and controversies chronicled here."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Steeped in ’70s and early ’80s chic, nostalgic for an era before social media when real stars ruled supreme, this heady stuff is well worth the investment."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"It’s a hell of a cast, all of whom deliver remarkable performances, and to McKay’s credit, he brilliantly captures the gaudiness of the cocaine-fueled late ’70s/early ’80s."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"When they let the inherently big personalities shine through, and let these actors really act, I loved it."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,HBO’s new sports drama is a lavish period piece unafraid to tell its story with painstakingly gradual detail.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,[John C. Reilly]’s great in his role as Playboy Mansion enthusiast turned NBA owner; so is Quincy Isaiah as Magic Johnson. And Jason Clarke is over the top as short-fuse coach Jerry West. It’s fast moving and wildly entertaining.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Basketball fans looking for a series that concentrates on the game will be disappointed. However, those simply looking to be entertained will find Winning Time: Rise of the Lakers Dynasty engaging."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"“Winning Time” will debut weekly, but there’s no higher compliment in this day and age than to say, it’s positively binge-worthy."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Like an excellent game where your team loses by just a few points, this limited series can be admired for reaching high even if the basket is missed."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"With a deft and biting commentary on race and gender and how it factored into the success of the Los Angeles Lakers dynasty, Winning Time is a highlight of 2021 already and should earn a well-deserved spot on your DVR."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Everyone seems to be having a great time, too, which helps. There are some performances in here, people."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Much like how no one man can single-handedly win an NBA championship, the show is much better when it remembers it's about a team and operates like an ensemble drama rather than a biopic about Magic Johnson."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"A whole lot of fun, whether you were around in the ’80s to experience the Showtime Lakers firsthand or not. It’s enhanced by fine performances and a style imprint from McKay that lends itself well to the topic."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Whether this season's wins, losses and drama are etched in your memory or you are coming in cold, the risk and tension feels as real as the rivalries, and it's all leavened by an insouciant sense of humor."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"There's an ambivalence to the way Reilly inhabits Buss, a sadness beneath the swagger, that makes you think a more challenging, biting show could emerge down the line. Even as a rich pro sports team owner, he's an underdog you want to root for."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"HBOs Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty wants to be the Boogie Nights of basketball, and more often than not achieves the excitement of that pitch."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"This collection of egos is never not interesting, forever colliding in ways fascinating and strange, comedic and fraught. Game on."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Winning Time is so captivated with its own style that it misapprehends what made its subject exciting in the first place.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Despite a plethora of well-tuned performances, its visuals and narratives stumble."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Winning Time is that kind of show: impolite, shamelessly unsubtle, highly entertaining."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"For all the off-the-court shenanigans, “Winning Time” is primarily about the basketball, and the writers display a keen knowledge of the game whenever McKinney, West, Westhead, Riley, et al., are strategizing."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"The series is so involving, even a lifelong Celtics fan may find himself (gulp) rooting for Buss’ dysfunctional collection of newbies, has-beens and established stars."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"[Winning Time] wouldn’t quite work without Reilly’s outsize magnanimity or Clarke’s tour de force as West. It’d fall even flatter if Winning Time didn’t appreciate the game’s ultimate hook, and the significance of its socioeconomic impact. But it does."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Yes, it’s significantly overstuffed and surprisingly crude, and I do wonder if non-sports fans will get into it, but for me, it’s a hell of a fun ride."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"This isn’t a game-changing drama, but it’s an absurdly entertaining one."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"If the creative confidence shown by the whole Winning Time in the first seventy percent of the season is anything to go by, they will pull it out in the end. And I will be cheering them along the whole way."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Essentially it locates a sports story as a Hollywood tale, all about flash, ego and fun. Magic Johnson (Quincy Isaiah) is the leading man, with the big smile, and a showboater. You don’t need to be a basketball aficionado, but it helps."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"It could all be too showy and distracting, but the performances pull you in, and keep everything afloat."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Perhaps what is most notable and welcome about Winning Time is its sheer sense of fun. In an era of darkly-lit, super-serious, joyless prestige dramas, Winning Time goes the opposite direction."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Once you get hooked into the story of how a struggling team reinvented itself and the NBA experience, you may find it hard to look away, even though its pleasures run more surface level than deep."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"The constant swirl of dramatic action, bigger-than-life characters and obsessive drive make “Winning Time” impossible to resist."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Winning Time seems so intent on insisting that it’s a fun show that it neglects the fundamentals.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"The Showtime Lakers reinvented the NBA bringing a lightning-fast game to the court and winning multiple championships along the way. While this first season has some hiccups, its not hard to imagine that the series will see a similar level of success."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,Winning Time is clearly the work of people who know and love basketball history.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"All involved with writing, directing and performing in Winning Time contribute to a winning mix that prioritizes the lighter moments without sacrificing the serious ones."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"Purists may complain about the recreated basketball, but that misses the point. What’s important here is the life the series portrays, the go-go-go 1980s NBA scene the Lakers helped usher in."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"For sports fans (especially Lakers devotees), the 10-episode first season’s unapologetically biased depiction of building a dynasty through near-catastrophic obsession should carry weight. For everyone else, it still puts on a show."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"An entertaining, if familiar depiction of complicated masculine genius."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,1,"HBO’s latest Sunday night offering isn’t so much of a layup as it is a slam dunk, delivering a fun, glitzy origin story of an iconic NBA dynasty."
Band of Brothers,1,"The battle scenes are spectacular, although wincingly graphic at times."
Band of Brothers,1,Band of Brothers is HBO at its very best.
Band of Brothers,1,"It wants to occupy a kind of middle ground, somewhere between the sobriety of documentary and the daring of great feature-filmmaking."
Band of Brothers,1,"Shot in England, the $120 million production is surprisingly short on familiar faces. But British actor Damian Lewis combines quiet strength and a convincing accent in the role of the all-American unit leader."
Band of Brothers,1,"The brilliance of Lewis in this is that he finds a way to make the ordinary aspects of Dick Winters seem extraordinary, rather than trying to play him as an overtly extraordinary man."
Band of Brothers,1,"In a sense, ""Band of Brothers"" is a lot like the war: it seems to go on forever, and you're glad when it's finally over. And, in a sense, that kind of authenticity may be the highest tribute that the filmmakers can pay the members of Easy Company."
Band of Brothers,1,"After watching the 10-hour ""Band of Brothers,"" I'm so drained by the intensity of what I have just beheld that I'm ready to declare this World War II miniseries the finest piece of work ever produced for television."
Band of Brothers,1,"In dusty browns and grays, ""Band of Brothers"" creates its own visual poetry, also mostly grim, affirming that on a primal level the stakes of combat are constant from generation to generation."
Band of Brothers,1,Band of Brothers may be the best film ever made to show the everlasting bond forged in war between ordinary men.
Band of Brothers,1,"[Damian] Lewis, whose noble, understated characterization of Winters is truly an inspiration, deserves every award television can throw at him."
Band of Brothers,1,Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks's miniseries is one of the best shows ever to grace the small screen.
Band of Brothers,1,"Its ten chapters compose an impressive fresco of the conflict, but above all of the soldiers who fought in it. [Full review in Spanish]"
Band of Brothers,1,Band of Brothers is ten years old and it still holds up as an excellent dramatic account of the second World War.
Band of Brothers,1,What is perhaps most striking about the project is its revelation of the ordinariness of heroism.
Band of Brothers,1,Rises above the current pervasiveness of its subject to take on the gravity of reconstructed history as art.
Band of Brothers,0,"A glorious bungle... At times visually astonishing. Unfortunately it also suffers from disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy."
Band of Brothers,1,"If it is heartening, it's because it defies cynicism and reveals the realities of courage, compassion, and brotherhood as real men in a horrendous war practiced it."
Band of Brothers,1,"A profoundly intense experience that outshines any other World War II epic ever seen on television - or, for that matter, in any Hollywood feature film."
Band of Brothers,1,This isn't glory; it has a deeper hum.
Band of Brothers,1,"No TV entertainment program has shown combat in such terrifyingly realistic and lethal terms, or so accurately depicted its frantic chaos."
Band of Brothers,1,"All of their actions, both heroic and savage, are revealed in the harsh light of impartiality."
Band of Brothers,1,"As with another Spielberg wartime project, ""Schindler's List,"" it's the real-life people who have the last, and best, word, after a reverent and effective dramatization of the horrors and heroes of war."
Band of Brothers,1,"Hanks and Spielberg do an excellent job of bringing the horror of war to life, after the painfully slow build-up of the first episode."
Band of Brothers,1,"Despite some flaws, ""Band of Brothers"" is an engrossing war story with much to recommend, from the spectacular special effects to moments of quiet drama."
Band of Brothers,1,"If the rest of Band of Brothers plays out with the same amount of intensity, I expect it to be a memorable but harrowing experience."
Band of Brothers,1,There's a reason why Band of Brothers earned so many awards and so much acclaim.
Band of Brothers,1,"Using 10 hours to show the full horrors of a five-year war is impossible, but by following a single company across its European battles we are given a sense of an impossibly huge conflict as seen through the eyes of real people."
Band of Brothers,1,... remains an incredibly visceral and evocative piece of war drama.
Band of Brothers,1,"... balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war."
Band of Brothers,1,"The battlefield scenes are so pulse-poundingly realistic and graphic, chaotic and terrifying, that viewers will be riveted, if not a little sick to their stomachs."
Band of Brothers,1,"Fortunately, the series is filled with lots of other fascinating figures and characters, even if we're just getting to know them now."
Band of Brothers,1,"Ten-part, $120 million adaptation of Stephen E. Ambrose's bestseller will rivet war buffs with its exceptionally detailed and sharply focused look at the conflict..."
Gentleman Jack,0,"The trouble with this period drama, based on the 1830s diaries of the stridently lesbian Miss Lister, is that it’s hard to care about her fiscal affairs."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Visually, this is one of the most beautiful things you’ll watch all year. From the carefully crafted period costumes adorned with curls and corsets to the stunning Yorkshire scenery, which helps the show retain so much charm."
Gentleman Jack,1,"She’s no saint, but she remains a riveting figure -- and Wainwright’s series a rip-roaring romp."
Gentleman Jack,1,"A tremendous and complicated character study that has lost none of its heart, charm, or momentum in stretching to a second season."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Once again ending on a high note, the best portion of the whole season is the final half-hour."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Jones gives a big, charismatic performance, to match Anne’s big, charismatic personality, but she isn’t chewing up scenery or anything like that. She has many subtle -- and sublime -- small moments."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Performance-wise, everyone is firing on all cylinders..."
Gentleman Jack,1,"We get pulled in by all of the romance and family drama, while the subtext makes itself felt in the strong writing."
Gentleman Jack,1,... There's something infinitely comforting about being able to literally pick up right where we left off with the ongoing adventures of Anne Lister from creator Sally Wainwright.
Gentleman Jack,1,A satisfying view into the domestic life of a queer marriage.
Gentleman Jack,1,"Gentleman Jack Season 2 is unexpectedly a comfort watch. It’s intimate and welcoming, with cozy settings by crackling fireplaces, and warm interiors of carriages and estates upon the misty Yorkshire Dales."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Frankly, Gentleman Jack could consist entirely of Suranne Jones delivering lines about the minutiae of sinking coal pits, and I would still be enthralled."
Gentleman Jack,1,"It’s exuberant, it’s fun, it’s playful. It just makes you feel good."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Season 2, luckily, is lower on the coal and higher on the messy drama. Sally Wainwright reminds her audience what an explicit, beautiful and authentic portrayal of lesbian desire she has created."
Gentleman Jack,1,"I could just feel myself getting queerer as I watched, every fiber of my body and spirit growing more dapper and bright. Jack-the-lass remains the gayest thing I have ever seen on TV."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Representative, daring, cerebral, and romantic, GENTLEMAN JACK remains one of the most original and refreshing series on television. Suranne Jones once again knocks it out of the park, balancing a complex character's strength and vulnerability."
Gentleman Jack,1,This is not your average period drama.
Gentleman Jack,1,"It’s Suranne Jones’s performance that’s still the main attraction. She’s a ball of tightly coiled energy, her big soulful eyes under mad brows looking stranded in her angular face, any softness in them offset by the two rolls of iron curls over each ear."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Gentleman Jack is disrupting the conventions of one of our most fiercely loved dramatic forms, at a time when we most need them disrupted. It is a masterpiece."
Gentleman Jack,1,"Conjuring up the ""what next"" after the happy ending is an unenviable task that should not be looked upon lightly. Arise Sally Wainwright who, for Gentleman Jack’s second outing, has crafted a pacy drama full of heart and wit."
Gentleman Jack,1,The phlegmatic language she uses is belied by the impressive breadth of emotion that Jones is able to convey with looks alone.
Minx,1,"TV comedies aren't normally filled with so many phalluses, but this series knows that it can't tell a tale about embracing the female gaze if it doesn't embody the very concept."
Minx,1,"Minx, in keeping with its pro-pleasure ideas, is a fun show, with lots of laughs and plenty of genuinely sexy stuff."
Minx,1,"This fictional origin story of the first porn magazine created for the female gaze is an entertaining, yet insightful, look into a time and place unwittingly defined by a burgeoning women's lib movement."
Minx,1,"The comedy comes mostly from the conflict between her buttoned-up, humorless feminist outlook and the compromises she has to make to get her magazine out there. It gets really funny."
Minx,1,"Despite its relatively few flaws, Minx is a bubbly treatment of sex, gender, and ambition during a watershed moment in American history. Its greatest source of charm comes from upending expectations."
Minx,1,The scripts are smart and the supporting players brilliantly cast. Expect plenty of penises but no smut.
Minx,1,"Joyce’s arc helps set her apart from the stereotypical, platitude-spouting figures who sell feminism but fail to do the work required."
Minx,1,"Minx also tackles double standards, racism and stereotypes, along with changing ethics in the thick of the women’s lib and civil rights movement of the early 1970’s."
Minx,1,It's time to subscribe!
Minx,1,"There’s a lot to enjoy with Minx, a smart and highly watchable series, and we’re excited to see where the show goes from here. No doubt there will be plenty of dongs along the way."
Minx,1,A wonderfully demented editorial tug-of-war... What makes Minx so delightful is that this mini culture war is accomplished with almost none of the spitefulness and contempt of the real one.
Minx,1,A snappy workplace dramedy drenched in the sunny glare of early 1970s Southern California.
Minx,1,"True to its title, Minx at its best is a sexy trifle, and the palpable chemistry between its leads counteracts the uptown girl/downtown boy cliché."
Minx,1,"It's a show that cares about its characters and wants the best for them, finding entertaining ways to make that happen within a larger context of continued struggle."
Minx,1,"Minx manages to capture the spirit of the swinging ’70s while examining themes that endure decades later. And it’s damn funny, to boot."
Minx,1,"Minx ticks many boxes. An original idea, flawlessly cast, executed with sharp humor and realistic pitfalls, Minx addresses a multitude of societal issues on both a macro and micro level."
Minx,1,"Minx made me think of GLOW, and Boogie Nights, but it’s very much its own blend of period comedy and social commentary. It’s original, and addictive."
Minx,1,"Jokes are plentiful and land with gusto. The cast has an immediate chemistry that feels both natural and well-honed. Johnson... has an engaged rapport with everyone around him, while Lovibond channels two iconic Dianes -- Keaton and Chambers."
Minx,1,"""Minx"" bets big on cocks of all sizes in its saga of feminism and full-frontal at an erotic magazine for women."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
Minx,1,"Minx is a bouncy, feel-good show that taps into the elation of creating something new where there was nothing before."
Minx,1,A breezy romp that also manages to be shrewd in the ways it interrogates sex.
Minx,1,So much about Minx works so well that I would love to be able to celebrate it as a series that eventually finds its footing and becomes an unqualified good time.
Minx,1,Minx is a fun examination of not only evolving sexual politics but the myriad emotions behind them.
Minx,1,"Minx may be targeting its audience’s funny bones far more than their neither regions, but it still knows how to satisfy."
Minx,1,"For all the bodies on display, Minx is, happily, turned on by the life of the mind."
Minx,1,"On its cover, “Minx” is salacious and flirty, a confection of sex and fun. Inside, though, it’s a multi-layered joy, the kind of comedy that reveals a few more intricacies and a little more humanity with each subsequent perusal."
Minx,1,"Its thoughtful but unapologetically filthy all at the same time, a kind of perverts alchemy that miraculously works."
Minx,1,Good fun [that] would make Euphoria blush...
Minx,1,"Though Minx could yet run the risk of being too frothy in execution... there's still something revitalizing about a TV show inherently rooted in themes of desire, sexuality, and unapologetic enjoyment of the risqué."
Minx,1,"Minx is effervescently fun, full of heart and smarts, and a heck of a lot of promise for what’s still to come. It’s a show that practices what it preaches, consistently prioritizing joy over pain and equality over repression."
Doctor Who,0,"I struggled to care about this meandering story, which involved John Bishop looking as if he’d fallen on hard times and gone into panto in a pirate costume from Aldi."
Doctor Who,1,"The Timelord is back for the second of three feature-length specials, and it’s exactly the sort of silly, riotous fun you’d expect."
Doctor Who,1,"They might’ve been nipped and tucked, but as with a lot of old Who monsters, these bug-eyed lizard monsters are too cartoonish to be truly scary. Fortunately, the episode features an excellent ensemble cast."
Doctor Who,0,"It's not that ambition is bad, but Legend of the Sea Devils is ambitious in all the wrong ways -- the unachievable ones."
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
Doctor Who,1,As much as I enjoyed this as a stand-alone episode... it didn't seem to have enough of a wow factor or a uniqueness to warrant it being one of only four specials.
Doctor Who,1,"""Legend of the Sea Devils"" isnt bad, exactly. It just lacks that sense of sparkle you want from a big holiday special."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Despite the show's relative longevity, this final season still feels like a perfunctory jump to the end, as if Winter expected Boardwalk Empire to last as long as Prohibition itself."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"Boardwalk Empire was an academic criticism that --emerges as a powerful return to the social commentary roots of the gangster film, and as a telling political manifesto on the dangers of the patriarchy."
Boardwalk Empire,1,The show's air of a dynastic saga unfolding down the generations is acquiring ever more Coppola-esque overtones...
Boardwalk Empire,1,"The end of a small, gilded masterpiece."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"The writing and acting in season 5's episodes have surpassed Boardwalk Empire's usual high standards, offering a pitch-perfect conclusion to a story that is surprisingly human in a world that's been intentionally strewn with subhuman behavior."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"I'm not entirely sure that the flashback sequences in the premiere work -- by now, we know so much of Nucky's history that these feel as redundant as the return of the ocean tide."
Boardwalk Empire,1,Boardwalk Empire's final bow is a brilliant conclusion to the series. [Full Review in Spanish]
Boardwalk Empire,0,It's too late to try to make Nucky a compelling character after so many false starts over the past four seasons.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"The current season had some missteps, but the bootlegging drama's finale packed a satisfying emotional punch, not to mention a few surprises."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"It was an effective double ending, the two story lines corresponding and playing off each other in parallel goodbyes."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"So many great actors, so little for most of them to do. Good acting can get you through times of confused and misguided writing, but can only take a show so far."
Boardwalk Empire,1,Our only complaint: should have been five episodes longer.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"... a smart, succinct, and interesting end to a compelling series."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"An undervalued series that, like The Wire, may only be fully appreciated after it's ended."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"It's been a great ride, even with the misfires of Seasons 4 and 5."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"Welcome back to Boardwalk Empire, which begins its fifth series with the sort of audacity that usually comes near the end of one of its slow-build seasons."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Every minute spent in Cuba drags the pacing to a crawl, even by this show's pacing standards."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"Boardwalk Empire is ruthlessly, irredeemably brilliant."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"Overall, the season premiere did a great job at piquing my interest about what lies ahead. I'm looking forward to heading over to Chicago and seeing what's new for the Capone family."
Boardwalk Empire,1,What makes this final season of Boardwalk Empire even more intriguing is the way its writers have chosen to fill in the missing pieces of Nucky's story.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"All the various threads seem ready to tie into one another fairly quickly - and with only eight episodes to the season, that's a good sign."
Boardwalk Empire,1,Will we be able to effectively settle into everyone's life in a way that allows us to more easily forget/forgive the years we've skipped? We shall see.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"It's well within the realm of possibility that Winter and company can pull off an affecting conclusion to the series, but as the end approaches, the degree of difficulty is higher than ever."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"If four proves to be a qualitative anomaly, and if the fifth season of Boardwalk plays out more or less like the first three I'll be satisfied. I know what the show is at this point, and I've quit expecting it to be anything else."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"In general, the 1920s and 30s are such an underexplored period in television that all of the historical and cultural touches scattered throughout give the show a patina of freshness"
Boardwalk Empire,1,No other show on television says so much about its world through sight and sound alone.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"In any era, and any location, Tim Van Patten continues to shoot the hell out of this show, and I liked seeing the transitions...from present to past."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"We got a glimpse into Nucky's childhood in Atlantic City. It was a fitting series of flashbacks, which gave all new perspective to what drives Nucky. The scenes at his home served to remind us how far he has come."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"HBO is marketing the final season of Boardwalk Empire with the moniker ""no one goes quietly,"" and after the explosive season premiere, I think we're in for one hell of a ride."
Boardwalk Empire,1,Boardwalk shows no signs of losing its identity. All signs point to a bloody proper finish.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"There are still pleasures to be found in Boardwalk Empire, but it's definitely time to wrap - and enjoy a good stiff drink as a reward."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"It's natural for Boardwalk Empire to focus its last season on its star, but-as admirable as Buscemi's restraint is in playing the ghostly gangster-Nucky's strength has always been bringing out the more interesting characters around him."
Boardwalk Empire,1,Sorting out the sins and sinners in the final eight episodes of Boardwalk Empire promises to be as intriguing as it will be intense.
Boardwalk Empire,1,It makes sense that this still-brilliant show feels a bit haunted now by characters lost and memories forgotten in the final days of a closing empire.
Boardwalk Empire,1,"Looking even more sweeping and cinematic than usual, the early episodes owe a distinctive debt to ""The Godfather"" saga, using extended flashbacks to provide insight into the character of Nucky Thompson, while jumping among multiple locales."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"The end begins -- evocatively, dramatically."
Boardwalk Empire,1,"In its final season, the series seems determined to follow up on its early tag line, ""You can't be half a gangster."""
Sharp Objects,1,"Episode Three: The Princesses, The Captain, The Fixer, & The Guns"
Sharp Objects,1,"Camille moves in a haze of pain, insight and intoxication (...) ruffling the smooth surfaces of settled lives, uncovering the gangrenous bones beneath."
Sharp Objects,1,Amy Adams' slow-burn psychological thriller will leave you on pins and needles
Sharp Objects,1,It's disturbing but yet it's a brilliant way to end the slow burner of series. It's a murder mystery I won't let go of in a hurry
Sharp Objects,1,Adams delivers a flawless performance once more and is perhaps the female TV anti-hero we have been waiting for.
Sharp Objects,1,"We don't see female anti-heroes like Camille on TV very often, a woman whose trauma and bad choices are written on her body in ways you will remember long after the show's final credits have rolled."
Sharp Objects,1,"[T]his was a mood piece first and foremost, an investigation more into the mind of main character Camille Preaker than any small-town murders."
Sharp Objects,1,"Misogyny and trauma are the focus and the feeling of Sharp Objects, but the story is so empathetic to women's perspectives that it never feels exploitative. A deeply immersive, feminist take on TV crime."
Sharp Objects,1,A good final episode has given a great closure to a miniseries that may not have been as solid in general terms as pointed its first chapter. [Full Review in Spanish]
Sharp Objects,1,"Adapted from a 2006 novel, Sharp Objects is unusual, but not in a bad way. Often creepy and disturbing."
Sharp Objects,1,The series offers a different perspective on female rage than what we've seen before.
Sharp Objects,1,Incredible character-driven drama that serves as a showcase for a fantastic female cast. Haunting atmosphere.
Sharp Objects,1,"There is a solid core to Sharp Objects, but HBO's... debuting adaptation of Gillian Flynn's 2006 novel takes an insular small-town slow-burn approach that borders on abandon-ship annoying."
Sharp Objects,1,Very few TV shows these days try and create an original visual language which elevates the material and makes it stylish and sexy. Sharp Objects does that in all its eight episodes.
Sharp Objects,1,"The writing is powerfully internalised, while Jean-Marc Vallee's textured, sultry direction is mesmerising."
Sharp Objects,1,"For as pretty, lush, and rich as Big Little Lies was, with its fantastical beach homes and upper-class satire, Sharp Objects is dirty, gritty, and less hopeful, even if it's just as captivating."
Sharp Objects,0,"Vallée seems more interested in making everything look ""dark,"" rather than let his fantastic actors take us through their emotional journey."
Sharp Objects,1,An enthralling show that's as much of a nuanced character study as it is a deeply disturbing exploration of violence and self-inflicted pain.
Sharp Objects,1,"Together [Vallée, Flynn, and Noxon advance] a thesis that goes beyond prestige TV's usual grimy view of a United States riddled with vice, malice and corruption: in Sharp Objects, the betrayal of women is the decay of America."
Sharp Objects,1,Patricia Clarkson delivers a blood-curdling performance that will surely sweep award season.
Sharp Objects,1,"The prevalent use of anaesthetics becomes slyly provocative, watching characters douse themselves in hooch or, more archly, in music."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's hard not to enjoy Adams in even something this self-consciously lugubrious. She largely makes us care about trainwreck Camille based on the goodwill she's earned as an actress in her previous films; Camille, as written, is otherwise just a hazy mess."
Sharp Objects,0,"There is much to recommend Sharp Objects: its visual language is rich and fugal (blades, pigs, fans recur) and rewards close watching. But the dissatisfaction of the show's conclusion speaks to a larger confusion in the aim of the series."
Sharp Objects,1,"The use of flashbacks, montage and music accentuate an overwhelming feeling and constant restlessness to take the viewer to an emotionally dark place. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Sharp Objects,1,"In an age of constant renewals and shows that refuse to bow out when they're on top, there's something to be said for the beauty of a self-contained story, well-told."
Sharp Objects,1,A breathtaking mediation on the subversive pain of being female in a world that wants only to destroy you.
Sharp Objects,1,"For too long, women - even when they were portrayed as unsympathetic characters - have been reactionary - to the commands, whims and moods of their male counterparts. Flynn and her stories are out to break those rules."
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects mixes murder and family into a gothic fable about the deep scars our cradles can leave behind.
Sharp Objects,1,"There is a remarkable amount of exposition...this is all constructed immaculately, in a very old-fashioned way."
Sharp Objects,1,"It is perhaps [the] intense directorial authorship [of Jean-Marc Vallée] - very few series are entirely directed by a single person - that is most distinctive about Sharp Objects. The mystery is good, but the tone, mood and style are better."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's bleak, vodka-fuelled, and I suspect it might become magnificent in its study of small-town denials, and how they fester only to erupt, decades later, like the blackest of buboes."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects' plot is appealing, as is the aesthetic and narrative consistency of its director. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sharp Objects,1,Adams seems to show another facet of his chameleon personality in the miniseries. [Full review in Spanish]
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is part and parcel of the streaming era, not an outlier. Put another way, don't take my word for it that the show is fantastic."
Sharp Objects,1,"It is truly excellent TV, which is why I regret to inform you that it is also totally TOTALLY wrong."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Sharp Objects,1,"What I appreciate most about Sharp Objects is that it is tuned into a particularly American irony: The forms of violence we condemn often sit uncomfortably close to the kinds of violence we condone, even celebrate."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects feels like it has the most to prove, insistently taking up prestige drama standards and then repositioning, reworking, or flat-out challenging them."
Sharp Objects,1,Boosting the class factor further is Patricia Clarkson playing mommie dearest. Think Blanche Dubois with a switchblade.
Sharp Objects,1,"It's no news that small towns have dark secrets, but Sharp Objects offers the freshest possible take on the rot within."
Sharp Objects,1,"Self-harm looms large in twisty, dark book-based series."
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects is one of the most beautifully constructed shows on TV.
Sharp Objects,1,Adams has poured heart and soul into Camille.
Sharp Objects,1,HBO proves once again that patient storytelling is worth the investment.
Sharp Objects,1,"HBO's ""Sharp Objects"" is a gift you will definitely want to have in your home."
Sharp Objects,1,"Adams pulls off the psychologically precarious lead character with a full-bodied (and if you're the betting type, probably award-winning) performance."
Sharp Objects,0,"It's slow, confusing, over-gothed and under-articulated. There's a good story squeaking from underneath all the messy baggage it carries, but it's probably easier to just go to Kmart for another suitcase rather than unpack this thing."
Sharp Objects,1,"[It's] gripping enough but requires patience. It's non-linear in structure, and be prepared, because while it's a murder mystery on the surface, it's about the exploitation and manipulation of women and the self-damage that results."
Sharp Objects,1,Homecoming tales have an easy shortcut to character and backstory...but Sharp Objects is no voyage in sentimentalism.
Sharp Objects,1,"HBO's latest limited series, Sharp Objects, is, quite simply, the programming event of the summer."
Sharp Objects,1,"Amy Adams has Patricia Clarkson's support on Sharp Objects, but the show is her cross to bear. She does it womanfully, and with no little virtuosity."
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects becomes a uniquely meta exercise in parsing the grim ways we talk about and secretly covet dead girls in a medium that loves them.
Sharp Objects,1,"Dark, stylized and not for the squeamish, the early installments of the eight-episode drama feel a bit like Rachel McAdams' arc in the second season of HBO's ""True Detective"" - only well thought out."
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects can be evocatively pointed with its figures and images. Its sick-joke surrealism ripens the mood.
Sharp Objects,1,Amy Adams' Sharp Objects stands a good chance at becoming the show of the summer.
Sharp Objects,1,"It's in the writing and the performances where Sharp Objects excels - this is a tantalising, confident show with a strong female voice, even if that voice sometimes belongs to monsters."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is as immaculately crafted from a writing, directing, and acting standpoint as any prestige project HBO has launched recently."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects intends to blur the line between past and present. I assume from the trailer and from what I know of the book and Flynn's other work that this idea of reconciling one's past is, as much if not more, the point of the story."
Sharp Objects,1,"Happily - albeit depressingly given its corrosively dark subject matter - it exerts its grip with increasing force, once you've committed yourself to stick with it past the first couple of episodes."
Sharp Objects,1,"[Adams] is the beating heart of every scene she is in, which is most of them."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's not so much a slow-burner as a slow-smoulderer, and it's mesmeric."
Sharp Objects,1,"Adams is even better than we've seen her before, giving us an absolutely mesmerising portrait of a woman ground down from within by what she has suffered and with no energy left even to hope for salvation."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is bleak by design. It offers little relief. It is sweaty and slow, with the sensory inputs - like all that sound - turned up until the walls and weather close in."
Sharp Objects,1,"While the storyline contains familiar (not to say overused) crime-story tropes, Sharp Objects succeeds as a mood piece."
Sharp Objects,1,"If the vein of resentment and inwardly directed rage feels relevant to 2018, it's because Flynn, Noxon and the series' other writers are simply acknowledging that it has always been there."
Sharp Objects,1,"Aiding both actresses tremendously is the sharp, confident, nuanced direction of Jean-Marc Vallee."
Sharp Objects,1,"The performance by Amy Adams in ""Sharp Objects"" is like the childhood memories of her character of Camille - intense, haunting and entirely unforgettable."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's difficult to tell this kind of a story and not utterly lose the audience. But Sharp Objects's touch remains delicate throughout, thanks to its gifted lead, its beautiful writing, and, yes, its laser-sharp editing."
Sharp Objects,1,"But it's the one-two punch of Adams and Patricia Clarkson, who plays Camille's mother Adora Crellin, that makes the series tick."
Sharp Objects,1,"The grisliness of the imagery, the aching damage in Camille, the delicate theatricality of Adora, the lovely danger of Wind Gap-all meld to make a series whose darkness is as alarming as it is undeniably enticing."
Sharp Objects,1,There's a lot of talent both in front of and behind the camera... and there's something alluring in how honestly the show sees the world.
Sharp Objects,1,"Director Jean-Marc Vallée gets the most out of the local landscape and the story by ""Gone Girl"" author Gillian Flynn."
Sharp Objects,1,"Amy Adams will soon be in need of an extra shelf in her trophy cabinet. She paints a complex portrait of a woman on the edge, in a masterful display of turmoil."
Sharp Objects,1,"A two-hour movie just can't compete with an eight-hour series for creating a layered, complicated world."
Sharp Objects,1,"Adams imbues Camille with a wary exhaustion, run down from decades of trying to outpace her demons. Her nervous fidgets and thousand-yard stare work almost perfectly in concert with Vallée's direction."
Sharp Objects,1,"Fortunately, for those willing to soak in the experience, director Jean-Marc Vallée allows for the slow burn required to inhabit Flynn's deeply personal corners."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is both more brutal than I expected and yet somehow also more enthralling, a story told in great chunks of grimness with little bursts of hope throughout, so unusual when they appear that you'll almost miss them."
Sharp Objects,1,"The haunted, swooning mood of Sharp Objects works on me, though. Comparisons to short-run mystery sagas like True Detective are obvious, but this is more of a simmering meditation, a portrait of multigenerational female strife."
Sharp Objects,1,"One can appreciate Adams' performance, though, without buying into the overall endurance test required by Sharp Objects."
Sharp Objects,1,"Adams never misses an emotional step, no matter how tricky the psychological footing gets. She delivers a dazzling performance that is the main and compelling reason for seeing this difficult trip through to the end."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects emphasises the suffocating nature of small town life, especially when laced with fear and suspicion."
Sharp Objects,1,"Everything Big Little Lies did to embrace, dignify, and elevate the soap opera genre's female characters and tropes, Sharp Objects does with pulp mystery."
Sharp Objects,1,"The atmosphere is chilling, but the plot keeps digressing, and the miniseries feels bloated. Still, the cast is first-rate."
Sharp Objects,1,"The gripping series is full of riddles waiting to be deciphered, and phenomenal performances by Adams and Clarkson pull viewers closer to whatever danger lies beneath with each hour-long episode."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is more than a murder mystery with a ripe female body at its center - in fact, it interrogates that very formula."
Sharp Objects,1,"Think Flannery O'Connor and Katherine Anne Porter meet True Detective and True Blood (aesthetically, at least-there are no actual vampires)."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's a show made of blink-and-you'll-miss-them flashes of gothic, tortured memories and time jumps that fold into the current action."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is Amy Adams's star vehicle: Flinty and wisecracking, damaged but resilient, her Camille is a hard-boiled hero with depth."
Sharp Objects,1,"This is no mere murder mystery - it is, in fact, a bleak, slow-paced character study hidden within one."
Sharp Objects,1,"With prickly vulnerability, Adams brings poignant dimension to Flynn's pulp melodrama."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
Sharp Objects,1,The invaluable Amy Adams hits myriad emotional notes and gives an Emmy-worthy performance as Camille Preaker.
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects is a slow burn, but it's also the perfect slow burn for summer."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects ultimately testifies to the triumph of survival, no matter how ugly or desperate a form it takes."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects suggests that matriarchy, too, can have its issues."
Sharp Objects,1,"They seem to make the point that if young women just keep moving, they might not get hurt. It isn't a pleasant message. But ""Sharp Objects"" isn't intended to make anyone feel safe and secure."
Sharp Objects,1,Adams bolsters her reputation as the gutsiest actress of her generation.
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects makes great use of flashbacks, stylized by Vallé (who directed and edited all eight episodes) in a way that feels totally seamless."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects, though pulpy, also asks for your patience and your interrogation. Watch with your bullshit detector on high alert, but feel free to get lost in its dreamy haze."
Sharp Objects,1,"""Sharp Objects"" builds a gradual sense of predatory evil and societal rot, and the acting's wonderful."
Sharp Objects,1,"What soon unravels is a gothic murder mystery steeped in suffocating small town history, but Sharp Objects is also an eye-opening look at abuse and the lingering effects of trauma."
Sharp Objects,1,"Sharp Objects insists that when women navigate a violent world, they are just as likely as men to crave power and pleasure, rather than goodness and resolution."
Sharp Objects,1,Sharp Objects is a modern stab at Southern Gothic drama.
Sharp Objects,1,To say much more would risk ruining how artfully Sharp Objects unfolds its mysteries.
Sharp Objects,1,"Women can, given the opportunity and budget, do anything a man can. This includes, it turns out, making beautiful, well-acted, cleverly plotted, exactingly glum prestige television."
Sharp Objects,1,Every word and image cuts like a knife.
Sharp Objects,1,"But the real reason to soak in ""Sharp Objects"" is to watch Camille sink deeper into her history, even as this comes to seem a worse and worse idea."
Sharp Objects,1,"Clarkson performs as only she can... It's a glorious, ugly performance."
Sharp Objects,1,"You will feel every grimy corner, every jagged edge, and every backstab that comes your way. This is the definition of event television."
Sharp Objects,1,This one is not to be missed. Sharp Objects cuts deep.
Sharp Objects,0,"Adams is good, ""Sharp Objects"" is deadly slow."
Sharp Objects,1,"She can imbue Camille with a fearless spirit and a broken one, sometimes simultaneously, and it's always an awesome sight. Adams trusts her director and the writing, but she also trusts herself."
Sharp Objects,1,Amy Adams [is] so raw and powerful.
Sharp Objects,1,"Amy Adams is devastating in this southern gothic mystery, which makes the decorum and despair of life in certain kinds of towns into a volatile and haunting experience."
Sharp Objects,1,"Beautifully constructed by Vallée and Noxon, and unforgettably performed by an ensemble that seems destined for awards ceremony stages in the near future."
Sharp Objects,0,"""Sharp Objects"" should leave more of a mark."
Sharp Objects,1,"There are many sharp objects in play in this intelligent, entertaining series, and a few sharp-edged people, too."
Sharp Objects,1,Amy Adams gives one of the best performances of her already stellar career.
Sharp Objects,1,Rarely has Vallée's signature felt so perfectly married to the material: a murder mystery set in a small town where a gothic ghost story hangs thick in the air.
Sharp Objects,1,Marti Noxon is back at it again with her shows about fed up women and I'm back at it again with LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT.
Sharp Objects,1,"TV's inundated with humorless serialized tales of murder that wallow in their own misery. Sharp Objects is at no point fun, but is executed at such a remarkable level that it's as thrilling as it is tragic."
Sharp Objects,1,"It's like True Detective or Twin Peaks but with more compelling characters, better dialogue and an infinitely more riveting and satisfying plot."
Sharp Objects,1,This might very well be the one-time Junebug actress' finest eight hours.
Sharp Objects,1,"Unlike ""Big Little Lies,"" whose big reveal you could see a mile away, [writer Gillian] Flynn knows how to string you along."
Sharp Objects,0,"Frustratingly opaque, and it moves like molasses."
Sharp Objects,1,"Like the Gillian Flynn novel it's based on, HBO's Sharp Objects is a fascinating fake-out."
Sharp Objects,1,"A psychological thriller based on the debut novel of Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, certainly lives up to its title."
Sharp Objects,1,The show is instantly addictive.
Sharp Objects,1,"With a cast led by Adams operating at the peak of her abilities, ""Sharp Objects"" is dazzlingly itself, a show in thrall to the horror of its premise but one that finds nuance within unremitting darkness."
Fringe,1,"The focus here is clearly on the characters, which has always served the series well in the past. Something tells me that strategy will work here again as Fringe comes to a close."
Fringe,1,It's storytelling highs are some of the best ever done in the science fiction genre. It continually delivered to its devoted fans. There was virtually no chance of a disappointing ending.
Fringe,1,"The nods to the past are sweet, but what any real Fringe fan wanted from these last episodes was a farewell to the characters we've come to love that feels emotionally satisfying - and on that level, this series finale more than delivers."
Fringe,1,"Fringe's final two hours were constructed as a big, action-packed adventure, an outline that served its finale well..."
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
Fringe,1,"Unlike Lost, which expanded horizontally as its story lines multiplied, adding characters like mayflies, Fringe has expanded vertically. It has maintained an equally challenging narrative... while concentrating on a core of three characters."
Fringe,1,"Over five loopy seasons, Fringe never once lost sight of that mission -- hunting down an answer to the question of what makes us ""us."""
Fringe,1,Just know that Fringe has such a strong emotional component that the feelings continue to matter at least as much as the fringe-iness.
Fringe,1,"Going into its fifth and final season, Fringe has proved itself to be the one and only true heir to Lost."
Fringe,0,"As Fringe's ambitions have grown, the sense of real risk, danger, and punishment have diminished to close to nothing as the series nears what will likely be an inadequate conclusion."
Fringe,1,We'll stick with this remarkable series to the end.
Fringe,1,TV's best sci-fi series returns.
Fringe,1,"Whether through laughter, tears or countless other emotions, there is rarely a time when I am left untouched."
Fringe,1,"We're all in this together, Fringe fans, watching to see how these last 13 episodes play out."
Fringe,1,"There's still hope for this story and this world, and as usual Fringe viewers will have to be patient to see that hope spring forth."
Fringe,1,"It's classy, inventive sci-fi with shades of Doctor Who, Looper, The Matrix and The X Files."
Snowpiercer,1,"The show needs to stay steady in its plotting and character development, which isn't to say that we received on either of those fronts isn't interesting."
Snowpiercer,1,"Every season of Snowpiercer feels like the world has been reframed, renewing the interest and vigor of the characters and boosting the momentum of the narrative."
Snowpiercer,1,The Tortoise and the Hare methodically arranges the chess pieces for what's sure to be a monumental season.
Veep,1,"Veep often felt like the anti-West Wing, as Iannucci replaced Aaron Sorkin's reverential treatment and ideological haggling of Washington politics, with a bullying contest of utmost vulgarity which seemed symptomatic of the times."
Veep,1,This is the way comedy is supposed to be.
Veep,1,"Veep should be remembered as one of the best ensemble casts ever, with Louis-Dreyfus surrounded by an absolute murderer's row of comedic talent."
Veep,1,The often brilliant comedy ended its seven-season run with an episode that highlighted the best of its brutality.
Veep,1,"The writing continues to be crisp, the humor remains potent, and a recovering Julia Louis-Dreyfus hasn't missed a beat."
Veep,1,"And yet, while it may not be quite as insightful or scathing as it once was, ""Veep"" is still one of the best shows on TV, largely because it has arguably the best ensemble, all of whom return at the top of their game."
Veep,1,"Landing every laugh with precision, style and grace, [Julia Louis-Dreyfus] isn't just the funniest woman working on television today. She's one of the funniest of all time."
Veep,1,"But in the end, if Veep is a show about political addiction, then the seventh season promises a look at what people do to either get sober or lean into their vices full throttle."
Veep,1,The ride is so fun and the writing so sarcastically clever.
Veep,1,"The writing and the delivery of the show's razor-sharp remarks remains impressive too, even if the storylines do cut dangerously close to the bone this time around."
Veep,0,The cast of Veep is so abject that it is one-dimensional. [Full review in Spanish]
Veep,1,Every single member of this cast could headline their own series and deservedly so. Now is the time to go back and binge the entire first six seasons of Veep before it goes out with one of the best final years in TV history.
Veep,1,"For all that this finale keeps getting described as dark, I was struck by how insanely optimistic that view of American politics really is."
Veep,1,"They may as well rename the Best Lead Actress in a Comedy the Julia Louis-Dreyfus Award. She was stunning, and the writing on this series - led by showrunner David Mandel - was next-world amazing."
Veep,1,"Over seven seasons, a real-life regime change, and a record-breaking number of Emmys for Louis-Dreyfus, Veep evolved into something different-harsher, bigger, and bleaker."
Veep,1,"From the reckless, madcap nature of the pacing to the emptiness in all of the characters' fates, it was a fitting an end to a political satire."
Veep,1,"By adapting through shifting social currents, and by fostering more raw malice than perhaps any other show on television, Veep has proven itself the only program capable of lampooning the otherwise comedy-proof Trump."
Veep,1,"""Every nation gets the government it deserves."" It's all your fault, Veep seems to suggest, with a disdain that'll continue to serve as a warning for future generations, just in case they feel the need to shake things up again."
Veep,1,"Everyone is either a fool, a knave or a monster in HBO's hilariously scabrous political satire starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus. After seven seasons, Veep ends its run with its sharp teeth fully intact."
Veep,1,"Veep is satire, parody, farce, pantomime and social commentary all swirled together to create this impossibly hilarious concoction."
Veep,1,"Selina simply lives, breathes, such crassnesses: gloriously, more than she should, she actually voices them."
Veep,1,In real terms Veep should be showing its age. And yet in the execution it feels as sharp as it always did. Perhaps more so given the embarrassment of riches that Washington D.C. shovels in the show's direction every day.
Veep,1,They're all as revolting as they're real.
Veep,1,"As in much of the best comedy, Veep operates by sly substitution. It promised a dick joke, a punchline about ineffectuality, a woman outside the party, uninvited. Instead, it gave the story of power's incapacity to see itself."
Veep,1,"While monstrous Meyer remains the centre of its semi-fictional universe, Veep is also an ensemble workplace comedy and it was a joy to see the gang back together, trading razor-sharp quips."
Veep,1,"This is masterful comedy, packed out with the darkest of zingers, its black heart buoyed only by the delighted embrace of its silly, clown-like brilliance."
Veep,1,A painful and hilarious x-ray of the most cruel of politics. [Full Review in Spanish]
Veep,1,"A nonpartisan, ideology-free lampoon of politicians as hypocrites or buffoons can be tame and housebroken, but the edge and viciousness of the satire in Veep places it in a special category of political comedy."
Veep,1,"It's the kind of show that makes you cringe as much as it makes you laugh, which, of course, is exactly what it wants you to do."
Veep,1,"The raucous good time of these new half-hours notwithstanding, one does wonder whether Veep will leave us in an uplifting place."
Veep,1,"I feel like Selina is the victim of some version of a Get Out experiment, but there's a rich, tall, white man trapped inside her petite woman-body, begging to be set free."
Veep,1,"For Veep's seventh and final season makes certain, the former president and her staffers are incapable of surmounting their old, dysfunctional patterns. Thank God."
Veep,1,This is satire of the darkest order...
Veep,1,"While real-life American politics disintegrates in real time, Veep focuses on what it does best: elevating some of the filthiest dialogue on television to an art form."
Veep,1,The writers wisely... focusing instead on staying true to the characters and the world they've built.
Veep,1,"The final season of Veep returns with all cylinders, working overtime doling out caustic barbs."
Veep,1,"What makes ""Veep"" masterful is how it understands true satire. In this seventh season the show brilliantly tears apart the very nature of campaigning."
Veep,1,[The cast is] in stellar form.
Veep,1,Veep works on a much deeper and more cynical level; I can imagine no sadder way to watch it than to compare and contrast it to the comedy of errors America has endured since the 2016 election.
Veep,1,"This last batch of episodes refocuses by turning to the singularly ridiculous process of launching a presidential campaign - a smart pivot that suits the show well, especially for a final season."
Veep,1,"In its last hurrah, Veep is an unimpeachable hoot."
Veep,1,"Veep is still as hilariously cutting as ever. Its performances are fantastic, its rhythm and density are unparalleled, and its sense of the absurd is still sharp."
Veep,1,"At this point in the show's run and our democracy's wobbles, Veep doesn't simply evoke real life. Real life inevitably evokes Veep."
Veep,1,"Lording over it all with flawless precision is Louis-Dreyfus, who brings an undercurrent of seething desperation to Selina as she embarks on her last-chance campaign."
Veep,1,"Veep remains one of the great comedies of this, or any, era. And these new episodes often left me howling. But as Selina lunges for the brass ring one last time, there are nearly as many cringes to be found as laughs. Enjoy, but beware."
Veep,1,Not everything is perfect in this final season... but its acknowledgement of the foibles of its leads in meta terms reminds us that this is a show that exists on its own terms.
Veep,1,"I'll miss Veep's prickly patter when it's gone, but I appreciate that, like Louis-Dreyfus's Seinfeld before it, the show aims to quit while it's ahead."
Veep,1,"Veep might have outlived its time, to the extent reality has seemingly eclipsed its jaundiced form of satire. In terms of providing laughs when they're sorely needed, though, it couldn't have picked a better time to mount its last campaign."
Veep,1,No show has ever captured the flim-flammery of politics with as much elan and a fondness for the most baroque profane language.
Veep,1,These last Veep episodes feel like a respite from even thinking about our present reality. It's certainly funnier than reality.
Veep,1,"""Veep"" knows us better than we know ourselves."
Veep,1,This season seems to delight just a little bit more in turning the mirror on present-day American politics and there are some astoundingly funny send-ups along the way.
Veep,1,There's still an undercurrent of realism to it all... but there's nothing on-the-nose about it.
Veep,1,"A joyful, wild, hilarious, insane -- and darker -- romp through the debasement of running for political office, as only ""Veep"" could imagine."
Veep,1,"At the center of it all is Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who remains an absolute master at the top of her game."
Veep,1,"Moves past the cynicism which defines the series into deeper reprehension. As in previous seasons, the dialogue is brilliantly vicious. But now there is a well-worn sheen of exhaustion over the enthusiasm of going after the biggest job in the world."
Veep,1,"It almost hurts to laugh. But laugh, helplessly and abundantly, you do."
Veep,1,"The politicians are still nasty, fire-breathing monsters, but ""Veep's"" sharp satire manages to expand the fire pit without dulling the flames."
Veep,0,[The] opening gave me hope that I was in for a fun final ride with this crew. But it was mostly downhill from there. There was a clear inability to capture the manic energy of the best episodes when Iannucci was in charge.
Adventure Time,1,The Adventure Time finale is a must watch for any fan of the series. I have been there since the beginning and was very pleased with the outcome.
Adventure Time,1,"As heartbreaking, adventurous and inventive a conclusion as the show deserves."
Adventure Time,1,"Epic and uplifting, surreal and tragic, and true to the series and its viewers."
Adventure Time,1,"It focuses squarely on the warmth and attention to intimacy at the heart of Adventure Time, rather than dizzying spectacle or surreal humor."
Adventure Time,1,"No matter what monsters are faced externally or internally, this series has always delicately preached its message that we are stronger together. Adventure Time's finale is the epic actualization of that long-whispered message."
Adventure Time,1,Feels like a goodbye to Adventure Time with a bolded asterisk... The show's spirit is something that just can't come to an end.
Adventure Time,1,It was weird and sad and silly and funny and harrowing and so quietly profound I'll be thinking about it probably forever.
Adventure Time,1,"Adventure Time, thankfully, chooses the most elegant exit it can."
Adventure Time,1,"Most fan-service is bad, but this [finale] was good."
Adventure Time,1,It's thrilling and sweet and a little bit tearful.
Adventure Time,1,"Come Along With Me has some of the elements you'd expect of a series finale. There's a wealth of callbacks to moments, catchphrases, and in-jokes from the whole history of the show."
Adventure Time,1,"More sensible to compare Adventure Time to Wicked or Sex and the City or Sopranos, these great cultural notions of (respectively) the good-evil paradigm or romance or masculinity deconstructed."
Adventure Time,1,"Even in the face of the apocalypse, that feeling endures, giving people a reason to keep living because they have a friend by their side."
Adventure Time,1,"It was a transformative approach to all-ages entertainment, but it was also too good to last."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Somebody Somewhere, starring Bridget Everett, defies small-town America stereotyping."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Somebody Somewhere is, despite some depressive trappings, a shockingly optimistic series whose small but frankly rather revolutionary thesis is that you can not only go home again but find a way to actually belong."
Somebody Somewhere,1,This bravado that has marked Everetts whole career is purposefully gone. Its a bold move that sets the stage for a really special performance.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"The Somewhere of the title is Manhattan, Kansas. Everett is definitely the disarming Somebody."
Somebody Somewhere,1,This is television that asks big questions on the sly.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Everett is why Sam is so wonderful to be around. Shes funny, she cares about people, and she can belt out a Janis Joplin song like its nobodys business."
Somebody Somewhere,1,Somebody Somewheres brilliance lies in the way it weaves between the hilarity and drama of the mundane.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"A delicate comedy about the restorative power of human connection, this series hinges on beautiful performances from leads Everett and Hiller, who have a friendship viewers immediately root for."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"[Bridget Everett is] the kind of person you just can't take your eyes off of, and Somebody Somewhere is poised to -- finally -- turn her into a really huge star."
Somebody Somewhere,1,Bridget Everett’s subtle and charming performance is just one reason we like Somebody Somewhere. The first episode also does a good job setting up a great ensemble that we look forward to getting to know.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Hiller is destined to become a stand out among the ensemble... This is almost sure to be the next big feel-good show (along with the delightfully quirky Abbott Elementary), though Somebody Somewhere is much more grounded than most of its predecessors."
Somebody Somewhere,1,A fantastic alignment of good writing and great casting.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Always a standout in whatever she’s in, comedy and cabaret star Bridget Everett is the focus of the endearing new series Somebody Somewhere... Jeff Hiller is great as a high school friend who draws her out of her shell."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"An invitingly unhurried pace with exquisitely observed, unforced, gentle humour, and a tone that easily shifts from hilarious one moment to deeply poignant the next."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"This is your moment, Bridget Everett."
Somebody Somewhere,1,A must-see with a fine knack for particularizing the subdued and the sweet.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"A disarmingly earnest portrait of loss, loneliness, and disappointment that nonetheless manages to be, above all, a tale of belonging and quiet hope."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Somebody Somewhere offers a modest, refreshingly clear-eyed take on the struggle to reinsert yourself into life, and grant yourself dispensation to find joy in the shadow of loss."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"The main draw... is Everett, whom I would watch do anything after imbuing Sam with this much bruised charisma."
Somebody Somewhere,1,America is about to discover what New York theater diehards have known for years: Bridget Everett is a force - and a voice - to be reckoned with.
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Everett is fantastic. Even with strong performances from Hiller as Joel and Mike Hagerty as Sam's dad, Ed, Somebody Somewhere lives and dies with Everett's remarkable tenderness toward this other, imagined version of herself."
Somebody Somewhere,1,Everett confidently holds the center of the seven-episode semi-autobiographical show...
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Sam may be down on herself, but the show about her turns out to be good at a lot of things."
Somebody Somewhere,1,"Blessed with an eagle eye for detail, a laid-back sense of humor and a disarming sense of compassion, Somebody Somewhere is a mostly low-key delight that occasionally spills over into sheer exuberance."
Somebody Somewhere,1,A comedy that finds a way to grace only after establishing pain at its heart.
The Gilded Age,1,"Carrie Coon should be considered an ISI mark for any project. If she's in it, there's definitely something to look forward to."
The Gilded Age,0,The fact that Julian Fellowes has a done a lot of research for this will be appreciated by a lot of people and especially for those who love his stuff. For others they may find it a yawn-festlike I did.
The Gilded Age,1,"It may not be illuminating, but “The Gilded Age” is undeniably entertaining."
The Gilded Age,0,"The sets are grand, the costumes are marvelous and every word out of Christine Baranskis mouth drips with venom. So why do the minutes pass by so slowly?"
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age has enough enjoyable bits and bobs to keep almost anyone interested, but even the most period piece avoidant will be drawn to Carrie Coons magnetic performance."
The Gilded Age,1,"While the five episodes of his new HBO period drama provided in advance to critics have yet to hit that Poor Mr. Pamuk sweet spot, the potential is here for a simply delicious soap opera."
The Gilded Age,1,"""Gangs of New York in The Gilded Age"" (In Spanish)"
The Gilded Age,1,"Nowhere near the depth and feeling of Downton Abbey, but the sets and costumes are wonderful.  Christine Baranski inhabits her wonderfully cantankerous role, but Louisa Jacobson falls flat as the main character."
The Gilded Age,1,"Those who prefer conflict with higher stakes than that of a dinner snub or a discarded invite might feel like somethings missing, but the HBO series will please those who loved Downton and have a deep appreciation for the finer things in life."
The Gilded Age,1,"Once again, Fellowes gives us smartly written characters, filmed in lavish sets and costumes, trying to fall in love. Its not new, but it works."
The Gilded Age,1,"""Erudite, elegant period drama in which 'old' money is suddenly confronted by 'new', threatening New York's aristocratic social hierarchy."""
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age may be glitzy, shallow soap opera rather than trenchant social critique. But its showy sets and able cast may be enough to stick with it as long as there are no expectations for another Downton Abbey."
The Gilded Age,0,"Sadly, this show, with its cardboard characters, out-of-the-box costumes and obvious movie-set streets is all over the place. And don’t get me started on the bogus CGI architecture."
The Gilded Age,0,HBO hired Julian Fellowes to make a Downton Abbey out of 1880s NYC. But all the fussy costumes and jewelry in the world can’t bring The Gilded Age’s story of old vs. new money to life.
The Gilded Age,1,"It isn't especially compelling, but it's still three stars because if you like this sort of thing (she says, patronisingly), you will like this. And the hats are tremendous."
The Gilded Age,0,It comes at you like an undulating wall of plastinated velvet. Watch a single minute of any of this overstyled nine-part period monstrosity about rich American families and you will end up gasping: what is this gopping Edith Wharton-style product?
The Gilded Age,1,Downton Abbey's brash and saucy older cousin is superior in its glamour and games.
The Gilded Age,1,"Although the series has some problems, hardcore Julian Fellowes fans will probably be pleased."
The Gilded Age,1,"At first this can make it all seem a bit low stakes, but the wider fascination with the foibles of the rich, and the ruthlessness with which fortunes are created, has been the theme of so much great TV of the last year."
The Gilded Age,1,"If it had nothing else going for it, The Gilded Age would be a must-watch simply for Christine Baranski's wonderfully sour one-liners."
The Gilded Age,1,"Julian Fellowes delivers must-see TV with an Americanized spin on his beloved ""Downton Abbey' and creates a feast for the eyes and ears. Is it more playful than profound, more froth than substance? Maybe. It's also perfectly irresistible."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
The Gilded Age,1,"Some of the characters seem as if they are there to prove points about the social situations, and feel generic at times. All that said, The Gilded Age is still a lot of fun."
The Gilded Age,1,"This is a show that happily invites us to dance in the past with a sector of society that judged itself on both moneyed influence and archaic codes. On a sophisticated level, it's kind of fun."
The Gilded Age,1,"It's perfectly watchable, and every intention and motive is signposted with Fellowes's usual clarity... But solid gold this is not."
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age is here and it's all snobbery and society balls, waspish aunts and snooty servants, and on a very ""new money"" budget - in other words, precisely the American Downton it was expected to be."
The Gilded Age,1,"Celebrities, billionaires and pots of money - this is reality TV from the steam railway era."
The Gilded Age,1,"All of it dares a certain kind of ""Masterpiece"" acolyte to complain missing the relative quietude of English countryside... The rest of us will be content to drool at each of Bertha's fabulous dresses or chortle at Agnes' quick comebacks."
The Gilded Age,1,"Fellowes and Warfield have created a vividly realized world, meticulously crafted with no expense spared -- not unlike one of Mrs. Russell's soirees."
The Gilded Age,0,Just what HBO ordered from the man who by now is surely actually churning this stuff out in his sleep rather than simply giving the faultless impression of it.
The Gilded Age,1,"Fellowes specialises in comfort television; one of his great skills is marshalling people and plots into one coherent, satisfying whole. By that measure, this is his best show since Downton."
The Gilded Age,1,"Though Gilded takes place in an interesting time and place, as well as a certain soapish appeal, it's ultimately more of a mildly diverting spectacle than the sort of emotionally involving drama that becomes an instant classic."
The Gilded Age,0,"""The Gilded Age"" feels remarkably inert, even dreary, for a story set in America's most exciting city in a period of turmoil."
The Gilded Age,1,"Like the Russells, this series feels like it's modernizing in the right direction, with plenty of exquisite drama along the way (albeit no accents)."
The Gilded Age,1,"The old New York setting is breathtaking, even as the initial plot is right out of Real Housewives -- everybody snubs the newbie's lavish party. With this many characters and this much talent, there's a lot of story left to tell."
The Gilded Age,1,"In sum, The Gilded Age excels at recreating the creature comforts of Downton Abbey. For those who want one, the show is an escapist balm, a comforting distraction from the woes of the world."
The Gilded Age,1,"A triumph of dazzling production and costume design, The Gilded Age astonishes with its opulence and entertains with its colorful depiction of class warfare in corsets."
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age captures all the glamour, extravagance and snobbery of a period now safely at a distance."
The Gilded Age,1,"It's a lot for 80 minutes, but Fellowes manages to sort it out with his usual combination of smart writing and ace casting."
The Gilded Age,1,"A great cast and high production value isn't enough to keep the show from feeling like a date retread of Downton Abbey, at least so far."
The Gilded Age,0,"The Gilded Age is lavishly made but dull. You can see the Fellowes formula from the opening minutes. It's Upstairs, Downstairs all over again."
The Gilded Age,0,Ultimately the writing is just so ... lacking.
The Gilded Age,1,"Hardly anybody in ""The Gilded Age"" is as pure, or as dark, as they initially appear to be. That's what makes them all so intriguing."
The Gilded Age,0,I truly can't bring myself to care about these people and their airless drawing-room lives.
The Gilded Age,0,"Julian Fellowes chased his new series, ""The Gilded Age,"" for a decade. Call it his white whale... you can watch it drag him and a large, talented cast beneath the waves."
The Gilded Age,1,"There's a certain comforting familiarity to The Gilded Age, and Fellowes remains adept at juggling a large cast and making an addictive drama out of the haughty concerns of the ultra-wealthy."
The Gilded Age,1,"While there's drama aplenty happening on the above-ground floors of these homes, there's also smouldering passions, thwarted ambitions and some big dark secrets..."
The Gilded Age,1,"Enjoy it for what it is: a big, borderline tacky item you might never have purchased for yourself but nonetheless delights you every time you see it."
The Gilded Age,1,Downton on steroids.
The Gilded Age,1,"The journey across the Atlantic seems to have invigorated [writer-producer Julian Fellowes'] imagination -- The Gilded Age is comfortably shaping up to be his most ambitious, if not his best series since Downton."
The Gilded Age,0,"The real American Gilded Age was a period of huge upheaval, but Julian Fellowes' The Gilded Age zooms in so closely that the arc of change looks like a plateau"
The Gilded Age,0,"There's an aimlessness to The Gilded Age: Somewhere along the line, someone forgot to ask why a show about these particular characters at this particular time would be compelling."
The Gilded Age,1,"With The Gilded Age, [Julian Fellowes] abandons jolly old England for the American frontier, and the results are as dazzling as they are dangerously familiar."
The Gilded Age,0,We know who these people are. They're clichés -- not unpleasant but wholly unsurprising.
The Gilded Age,1,"Another fantastic confection from Downton Abbey's Julian Fellowes - but distinctly American. Also much more history is included. Coon, Spector & Benton are the stand-outs."
The Gilded Age,0,"The Gilded Age is a feast for the eyes, and its aesthetic pleasures are undeniable -- but those are the only pleasures to be found here."
The Gilded Age,1,The Gilded Age is a perfect period drama for 2022.
The Gilded Age,1,"In many ways The Gilded Age is a series about the different ways of living, and of looking at the world, that can exist within a shared space."
The Gilded Age,1,"It is a show where the stakes can feel terribly small, even though the acting and production values are fabulous enough to conceal the problem for many scenes."
The Gilded Age,1,"This is a show where the phrase 'great gowns, beautiful gowns' isn't a backhanded compliment, although The Gilded Age is much more than its pretty window-dressing."
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age as it stands is a pleasant enough distraction for another COVID winter, though you'll likely find yourself wondering what might have been if it had made just a few different choices along the way"
The Gilded Age,1,"Fellowes remains an absolute master at juggling a dizzying number of subplots as well as finding intriguing wrinkles in characters with relatively small roles,"
The Gilded Age,1,"If you are looking for the immersive distraction of a trip to the well-appointed climes of yesteryear, The Gilded Age serves that up with eager largesse. Consuming the rich isn't quite eating them, but it'll do until the reckoning comes."
The Gilded Age,1,"Like Fellowes' other period dramas, ""The Gilded Age"" has zip. It's not stuffy or fusty."
The Gilded Age,1,"If you're normally enamored with period dramas, Masterpiece on PBS, or well-orchestrated ensemble pieces, The Gilded Age should provide plenty of entertainment in the weeks to come."
The Gilded Age,1,"[Writer-producer Julian Fellowes] gathers together bits of Edith Wharton, Henry James, William Dean Howells, Theodore Dreiser, and others, and deploys them in service of his own smart, sly, and delectably soapy storytelling purposes."
The Gilded Age,1,The Gilded Age is easily the best new series of 2022 and sets a high bar for shows that will follow.
The Gilded Age,1,"It's a period piece set in 1882 New York that can be watched as a history lesson but still keeps things entertaining with melodrama and romance. There's an infinite array of chic gowns, mentions of tea and apple tarts, and women have the juiciest roles."
The Gilded Age,1,"The series considers the social currents of the historical moment, alluringly cutting through the delusions of its aristocrats."
The Gilded Age,1,"Both fans and newcomers to [Fellowes'] work will find much to relish here, not least his trademark drought-dry wit and his attention to place and character."
The Gilded Age,1,This is not some sharp turn in Fellowes' creative output. But there is something intriguing about this examination of old and new money.
The Gilded Age,1,Give it a minute and you'll be hooked.
The Gilded Age,1,"The Gilded Age would be well served by a little more... sauciness, though as long as Fellowes' words are emerging from the mouths of this ensemble, I'm prepared to be patient."
The Gilded Age,1,"In its early going, ""The Gilded Age"" struggles in one area - dialogue - but excels in enough others to keep viewers of the right cast of mind engaged."
The Gilded Age,1,"For the most part, it entertains without illuminating."
Chernobyl,1,As masterful as it is haunting and shocking — which is exactly what a show about such a dark chapter of recent history should be.
Chernobyl,0,"That methodological approach gives the HBO Chernobyl series a distinct impression of truthiness despite factual errors, almost all of which were unsubtly designed to make the Soviet government look bad."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is a winner in many ways. The acting, the direction and the fact that it brings to light a story that the world should know more about."
Chernobyl,1,Episode 42: Crawl / The Last Black Man in San Francisco / Chernobyl / Midsommar
Chernobyl,1,An open nuclear reactor core burning our synapses through sheer magnitude of existential incomprehension (...) an apocalyptic serialised memento mori.
Chernobyl,1,"With Stellan Skarsgård and Jared Harris, [this] told a far more compelling story about this disaster."
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl showed audiences the dangers of authoritarian governments that refuse to acknowledge reality and insist on the narrative above all else.
Chernobyl,1,"[A] mini-series that, for just over a month, made us forget that Game of Thrones ever existed. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl has a menacingly gripping narration and writing. It never lets the attention of the viewer waver, and it does that not by breathless pace but subtly outlining the enormity of what we are witnessing."
Chernobyl,1,Objectivity is Chernobyl's best ally. This is the best thing I watched in the entire year of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,"The pleasure of the story, if you can call it that, is... knowing that we - all of us - are part of something bigger than ourselves; that doing what is right might not always be best for the individual, but serves the greater arc of civilization."
Chernobyl,1,What is so good about this drama ... is that it has a cast of British actors but none of them are trying to do a terrible Russian accent.
Chernobyl,1,"Books, films, and spiritual practices which can serve as antidotes to our wayward capacities for violence."
Chernobyl,1,"...created with an awesome attention to historical accuracy and detail, brought back that harrowing event with frightening clarity and a superbly orchestrated sense of danger and dread."
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl is really the whole package - it's got a brain and a heart and some really thoughtful things to say.
Chernobyl,1,A riveting showcase for sheer storytelling craft ... Chernobyl is great TV - some of this year's best.
Chernobyl,1,"While the first two episodes have been incredibly heavy, they have also been an exercise in stellar filmmaking and performing."
Chernobyl,1,"Silence, on Chernobyl, becomes a killer and it's why this miniseries exists: to speak up so disasters like Chernobyl don't happen again."
Chernobyl,1,"The Chernobyl disaster is an ideal subject for a series like this. But while [Craig] Mazin makes an occasionally powerful case about the costs of willful ignorance, the show never transcends its horrifying subject."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is a series where you will have to remind yourself to unclench your jaw and un-tense your shoulders while watching it. It is heartbreaking and intense, and a hell of a thing to watch the day afterGame of Thrones. But it's also necessary."
Chernobyl,1,"The five-part miniseries is an unmissable television event, but it is one that will harrow you, a horror story in the guise of a historical docudrama."
Chernobyl,1,"Mostly, I don't think it does. This is historical drama, not documentary. And I think [Craig] Mazin was right to take liberties in order to reach the deeper emotional truth."
Chernobyl,1,It's always compelling and often terrifying.
Chernobyl,1,"The show is exceptional in revealing - in steady, shocking increments - how a large-scale disaster distorts everything it encounters. At first it is the truth, but the human casualties soon follow."
Chernobyl,0,"What makes one kind of false representation-language and accent-more acceptable than another, such as race?"
Chernobyl,1,"""Chernobyl"" the series has been nominated for 19 Emmy Awards, and it deserves all of them - especially for Harris and Skarsgärd but also for Emily Watson."
Chernobyl,1,"The triumph of Chernobyl as a mini-series, then, has less to do with its uncanny ability to present an accurate picture of the past, and more about its prescient ability to gaze forward."
Chernobyl,1,It's hard to find a weak link in this show.
Chernobyl,1,It is a beautifully written and sensitively directed treatment of the horrifying events in the Ukraine spring of 1986
Chernobyl,1,"As a piece of 'entertainment' Chernobyl isn't easy going, however this well defined and complex tale is definitely worth your time. It crafts a detailed depiction of the Chernobyl disaster, while also delivering stellar performances with its able cast."
Chernobyl,1,"A superb and grim adaptation of infamy. HBO's Chernobyl does a fantastic job of placing us there with the victims, villains and the overwhelming sadness. [Full review in Spanish]."
Chernobyl,1,"Beyond retelling history, Chernobyl tells a very human story about mistakes, cutting corners, lies, assigning guilt, sacrifice, and coming together to do what needs to be done."
Chernobyl,1,[Director Johan] Renck knows how to register the horror... but he also has a lyrical eye. [Full review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,"With renewed interest in the 33-year-old disaster has come a curious sense of moralizing proprietorship - which makes you wonder what, exactly, people are getting from the miniseries."
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl does what the best stories do: It details events within a specific time and place while also revealing deeper truth that extends well beyond the bounds of a single narrative.
Chernobyl,1,Drama based on Russian disaster is brutal but relevant.
Chernobyl,1,One of the best series in the history of television. [Full review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,Craig Mazin's exceptional series will cement itself as a deeply personal and poignantly crafted piece of art that not only serves as a historical reminder but as a warning to those who are willing to pay the price of cutting corners on a world stage.
Chernobyl,1,"HBO's five-part Chernobyl series is perhaps one of the best examples of cosmic horror that has ever been filmed, and that feat is made more impressive by the fact that the show is based on real-world events."
Chernobyl,1,"The series' ambition goes beyond the beauty of the horror. It's more than a simple chronicle, or the dramatization of real facts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is interested in a hyperrealistic take on an autocratic society, where change is slowly and painfully chipped at from within. Its heroes aren't glamorous revolutionaries, but tweedy bureaucrats and scientists."
Chernobyl,1,Craig Mazin's 'Chernobyl' and its five episodes of creeping dread could not have come at a better modern socio-cultural and political moment.
Chernobyl,1,"By focusing on the commonly human instead of getting bogged down in politics or tempted by the lure of a central set-piece spectacle, is where Chernobyl stands out."
Chernobyl,1,"Unlike some historical miniseries, which take liberties with the truth, Chernobyl looks utterly legit."
Chernobyl,1,A pure and majestic exercise in terror. [Full Review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,A masterful suspense tale directed with nerve-shredding gusto by Johan Renck... The way Mazin distills the complexity of the situation into potent dialogue is a marvel.
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl honors the heroes who saved us. ""There was nothing sane about Chernobyl,"" Legasov says, but he was wrong. The human response to the disaster and the desire to protect the living-I can't think of anything more sane than that."
Chernobyl,1,The finale is the show's crowning achievement.
Chernobyl,1,It entertains you and they never lose sight of the fact that they're treading very delicate water here.
Chernobyl,1,It's rare to find entertainment that imbues import into the mundane so well.
Chernobyl,1,"We may no longer be in Gorbachev's USSR, but we're just worshipping different masters now, the show seems to say. Some of them have orange skin, others wear orange clothes."
Chernobyl,1,"[Chernobyl] is not just excellent television; it's paradigm-shifting historical storytelling, the kind of tale that alters, ever-so-subtly, the texture of the real world."
Chernobyl,0,"At its best, the show emphasizes the layered venality of careerist buck-passing and the hopeful denialism of those who will refuse to think the unthinkable; at its worst, it suggests that these are specifically Soviet characteristics. They are not."
Chernobyl,1,Everything has been beautifully articulated - from the devastating human cost to the science of radiation to the machinations of the Soviet system. I've even enjoyed the architecture and drab decor.
Chernobyl,1,"The series is upsetting, gritty. The show's visual spectrum runs from gray to olive, the affective one from dangerous to drab. But there is something heroic-wasteful and sad, but admirable nonetheless-in the way of giant sacrifices..."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is a disaster movie, a spy movie, a horror movie, a political thriller, and a human drama, and it spins each plate expertly."
Chernobyl,1,A real gem. [Full review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,... gripping and most definitely not for the fainthearted.
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl tells a haunting nightmare that speaks to us still. It seems to ask if we're always doomed to act only when it's too late.
Chernobyl,1,The series is brilliantly structured and anchored in outstanding performances. [Full review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,"The gripping five-part miniseries, Chernobyl, manages to viscerally recreate it - the horror, heroism and sheer folly of it all."
Chernobyl,1,It is likely that the future will see that Chernobyl left a much deeper and longer impression on culture than Bill Nye's burning of the iconic schoolroom earth.
Chernobyl,1,"There is much beauty, much ugliness."
Chernobyl,1,No piece of dramatised non-fiction has ever felt this authentic.
Chernobyl,1,It's a real-life disaster movie that you can't tear yourself away from.
Chernobyl,1,"Bathed in bleak, sickly green light, [this] series is an interesting one not just for being a pulse-troubling depiction of the world's worst nuclear accident, but an equally unsettling examination of political buck-passing and Orwellian doublethink."
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
Chernobyl,1,They've done a really great job depicting the emergency... [And] It's this amped-up version of the debate that we have now about issues like global warming and our inability to agree on facts apart from political spin.
Chernobyl,1,"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster."
Chernobyl,1,"The fact that it really happened -- and for all of its devastation, could have been worse -- makes this five-part slog of unrelieved misery even more chilling. It's hard to watch -- but you already knew that."
Chernobyl,1,"Depressing as it may be, Chernobyl, created and written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck, is a fine study in the uses of sanctioned obfuscation."
Chernobyl,1,"The show's best in small moments, suggesting subtly how Chernobyl revealed the existing horrors of a political system that would flail off history's stage just a few years later."
Chernobyl,1,It's hard to imagine a more despairing portrait of humanity's continuing capacity to ruin itself than this account of a disaster that's three decades old.
Chernobyl,1,It's a portrait of a meltdown on too many levels to count. It doesn't take a nuclear physicist to see why it makes a lot of sense to look back on this moment right now.
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
Chernobyl,1,An exemplary miniseries with an asphyxiating dose of reality. [Full Review in Spanish]
Chernobyl,1,"HBO's Chernobyl is a tense, terrifying, and brilliant account of the horrible tragedy that took place in 1986."
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl feels especially timely.
Chernobyl,1,"Though it packs the fascination of a documentary, it's the human drama that makes this one a must-see."
Chernobyl,1,"""Chernobyl's"" pacing slows in the third and fourth chapters, but the miniseries finishes powerfully."
Chernobyl,1,It's the scariest thing I've seen on TV in ages.
Chernobyl,1,"The unique thing about Chernobyl, the mini-series, is that while it set out to illustrate the horror of a nuclear disaster it also aims to interpret how the disaster was handled by those in power."
Chernobyl,1,"By its finale, Chernobyl has transformed from a story about plant-operator faults to one about systematic deception..."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl returns HBO to the forefront of networks daring to tell difficult stories of import without any seeming concerns about whether or not they'll be ""hits."""
Chernobyl,1,"The performances turned in by [Stellan] Skarsgård, Emily Watson and Jared Harris are passionate and nuanced enough to compel the tough viewers to gut out the squeamish parts."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is a thorough historical analysis, a gruesome disaster epic replete with oozing blisters and the ominous rattle of Geiger counters, and a mostly riveting drama."
Chernobyl,1,"It's a chillingly powerful mosaic of the catastrophe, from its technical origins in pathological Soviet secrecy to the exorbitant toll it continued to exact on innocent people all over the country long after the reactor was contained."
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl digs beneath the radiated earth, pulling up alarming truths that often come across as depressingly timely."
Chernobyl,1,"With a stellar cast and a script that cranks up the tension, Chernobyl relays an astounding and, at times, incredibly relevant tale."
Chernobyl,1,"""Chernobyl"" is a riveting drama that's full of payoffs."
Chernobyl,1,OK. I cried. But that wouldn't stop me from watching it all again because it is a story that needs to be told in the very dramatic fashion that five hours of Chernobyl allows.
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is, as much as anything, a comment on the power of government to impede positive solutions to scary problems."
Chernobyl,1,"Director Johan Renck distils dread from every shot of drifting smoke, sifting particles and insidiously seeping waters."
Chernobyl,1,Chernobyl drowns out the clanging gears of historical reenactment through the sheer quality of its construction.
Chernobyl,1,"Chernobyl is relentlessly bleak, but it has a remarkable cumulative power."
Chernobyl,1,"Watching this miniseries is a grim affair, and I mean that as a great compliment to creator, writer, and executive producer Craig Mazin and director Johan Renck."
Chernobyl,1,"This isn't just a gripping five-part disaster film but an examination of Soviet news-speak in its late-stage death throes. It's intelligent, at times intricate, explanatory journalism, especially about nuclear power technology."
Chernobyl,1,"As horrible as every minute of the impending terror of this series absolutely is, there's also a sense of deep respect and empathy for those who gave their lives fixing their government's mistakes."
Chernobyl,1,"Rather than bursting into shocking twists, writer Craig Mazin and director Johan Renck build a steadily creeping unease, allowing the scale of the atrocity to sink in with terrible, fitting gravity."
Chernobyl,1,"Each nauseating moment, be it a shot of decaying human flesh or a decision made for the wrong reasons, has a purpose - and pays back the viewer for their investment. ""Chernobyl"" is a stunning dramatization, and one worth admiring on many levels."
Chernobyl,1,"You should at least know what you're getting into with Chernobyl and if you can face that awful, true story, then by all means take it in. But it won't be for everyone."
Chernobyl,1,"It doubles as a warning about who pays the cost when the hard facts of science butt up against political agendas, whether decades ago on the other side of the Iron Curtain or here and now. Some bad decisions have half-lives that last for centuries."
Chernobyl,1,Mazin does an admirable job tackling such a complex tale from so many perspectives.
Chernobyl,1,It's an anatomy of a disaster that mesmerises as it appalls.
Sex and the City,1,"People watched Carrie Bradshaw, complete with her anxiety, fits of insecurity, and complex emotional needs, and thought, She's psycho. I watched her in her worst moments and instead thought, I'm normal."
Sex and the City,1,Nearly Seinfeldian in its ability to recreate the strange landscape of New York City with sharp insights and hilariously dead-on character portraits.
Sex and the City,1,"A show that was simultaneously progressive and regressive... Still, I return to it."
Sex and the City,1,"A brilliant, daring, pioneering show... What was most striking about seeing it again was its sharpness. The lines crackle with sly wit."
Sex and the City,1,"A masterwork of self-reflexive puns, clichés and popular assumptions."
Sex and the City,1,"The characters have matured, the stories are more grown up. There's still sex and especially sex talk, to be sure, but it seems less smutty. Or maybe I've just become inured to it. Either way, the series and its characters have aged well."
Sex and the City,1,"While the show set high expectations for countless New York City migrants, it remains a fixture of the conversation."
Sex and the City,1,"In a rush to tie up all the loose ends, the plot turns distinctly soapy and loses some of the biting wit that made the show fresh. The leading ladies, however, are now so comfortable in their characters that they can draw laughs from even a weaker script."
Sex and the City,1,What's remarkable about Sex and the City is how fearlessly it has depicted the double-edged swords of sexual liberation and post-feminist independence.
Sex and the City,1,"Whatever class issues, or race issues, or gender and sexuality issues Sex and the City might have swept under the rug (or addressed in a problematic way), it still functioned as a loud, oft-obscene call for agency among the marginalized."
Sex and the City,0,"I got to wondering: didn't we reach a climax in our relationship with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda sooner than any of us would dare to admit?"
Sex and the City,1,"Carrie Bradshaw is no Tony Soprano, but she gives you a reason to keep paying that HBO freight."
Sex and the City,1,"The show always had a realpolitik directness about such social pressures; as another HBO series put it recently, winter was coming."
Sex and the City,1,"SATC undercut the portrayal of women as catty and petty [...]. It helped to pave the way for ensemble shows like Girls, Broad City and Insecure, which portray complex women and their relationships sympathetically."
Sex and the City,1,"Underneath the glib, brittle exterior, best exemplified by columnist Carrie's narration, was a series that still believed in old-fashioned screen love. Sex and the City wanted romance along with the raciness."
Sex and the City,1,"At its best Sex is always a celebration of womanhood, with or without men, and that point of view comes joyously through this season."
Sex and the City,1,"Few television series have willingly put a clock, biological or otherwise, on their characters like Sex and the City. Then again, few series care so much about being real, being authentically evolved as this one."
Sex and the City,1,"Even with all its giddy departures from reality [...], the show has always nailed the weird arithmetic of love: Each new relationship adds baggage, subtracts expectations, and recalculates one's outlook."
Sex and the City,1,"Sex proves it still has a sharp eye for the passing scene. BOTTOM LINE: Funny, but showing its age."
Sex and the City,1,"Each of the four women in the show, like the show itself, has matured and improved with age. It's an enjoyable, encouraging journey to witness, especially considering that most TV shows in their sixth season are sliding downhill."
Sex and the City,0,"By the time the show had ended its run on HBO, it was already like putting lipstick on a corpse; the flesh was willing, albeit a bit withered, but the spirit has long departed. Not that there ever was much soul to begin with."
Starstruck,1,"Matafeo is still a multi-layered marvel as Jessie, especially as the series wades through more of her tumultuous choices."
Starstruck,1,"As the movie theaters continue to side-eye the rom-com, HBO Max’s ‘Starstruck’ is proof that the small screen could be the perfect home for the beloved genre."
Starstruck,1,"Jessie, who is played by the show creator, Rose Matafeo, is a kind of rom-com heroine we just don't see nearly enough."
Starstruck,1,"Matafeo and Patel triumphantly return as Jessie and Tom, wielding their charmingly awkward chemistry and seemingly effortless flirtation in order to tackle new relationship challenges beyond the ""what is this?"" conversation."
Starstruck,1,"The second season is nearly as strong as the just-about-perfect first go-round, offering a half-dozen more bingeable episodes (though lacking a moment as instantly iconic as Jessies post-hook-up dance to ""Return of the Mack"")."
Starstruck,1,This show is a gem. You should watch it.
Starstruck,1,The Rose Matafeo-helmed rom-com returns with more delightful observations into the oft-criticized genre...
Starstruck,1,"I'm amazed at how it never really feels like a typical sitcom, all the characters are believable and its a great ensemble cast."
Starstruck,1,"For his part, Patel flexes his romantic hero muscles so smoothly, mastering the “look of love” gaze that comes with the role..."
Starstruck,1,"Starstruck kicks off its sophomore run in hilariously charming, messy, and entertaining fashion taking Jessie and Tom through a relationship obstacle course."
Starstruck,1,"Season 2 of Starstruck takes the show from the novelty of the star-regular-person dynamic of the first season and concentrates on the chemistry of the ensemble, which is the sign of a maturing show."
Starstruck,0,"The reason why romantic comedies never have sequels is because either everything is going well with the couple and there’s nothing to watch. Or, there is conflict and the original love story is ruined. Starstruck’s second season suffers from the latter."
Starstruck,0,Haven’t we already been here? Are there not new dilemmas from which to mine comedy?
Starstruck,1,"It’s funny and a little heightened and very smart, but it’s more interested in ordinary things than grand gestures."
Starstruck,1,"Matafeo’s voice is completely distinctive and the show is her voice, so I look forward to future seasons of Starstruck offering an effervescent escape from the gloomy norm."
Starstruck,1,"Once the last episode's end credits roll this time around, you'll be reminded of exactly why you fell in love with Starstruck in the first place, too."
Starstruck,1,"The show does a rather remarkable job of reshaping the contours of their epic first season will they/won’t they story into something that is new and different, but no less compelling than it was before."
Starstruck,1,"Starstruck remains one of the most charming shows on television - and, with its mature and thoughtful second season, one of the smartest shows too."
Starstruck,1,This is still very much Jessie’s story and a look at modern relationships and quarter-life angst that many of a certain age will be able to identify with -- and laugh along to.
Starstruck,1,"Starstruck is just as huge-hearted as it was the first time around. It’s also shrewdly observed and gloriously silly, and the casting is spot-on -- but it’s not as funny as the first series."
Starstruck,1,"Matafeo is endlessly watchable, her timing and delivery pure alchemy, and Sidi is fantastic. Even the side roles work hard."
Starstruck,1,"It’s still lovely, a scene-stealing Minnie Driver returns as Tom’s agent, and it has a great script."
Starstruck,1,"There are few series that can sustain being watched in one sitting, but Starstruck is one of them, and I would argue that this lovely, warm, witty series even benefits from a binge-watch."
Starstruck,1,"Is the magic still there? Happily, very much so. This is one of the loveliest low-key gems you’re likely to see all year."
Starstruck,1,"Jessie’s never going to give up hope, and while she’s on screen it’s easy to come along for the ride."
Naomi,1,"With only two episodes available to preview, it’s too early to know how “Naomi” will tell its story, but it’s stylish, entertaining, and fresher than the typical superhero show."
Naomi,0,"On both the teen and super aspects, this series misses the mark."
Naomi,1,"If the early installments are anything to go by, the unfolding central mystery -- coupled with a winning performance from Kaci Walfall in the title role -- should make for a compelling through line as it plays out over the season’s 13 episodes."
Naomi,1,"As played by the very capable Walfall, it’s easy to believe that Naomi’s always been the main character."
Naomi,1,"In all that chaos of continuity and commentary, Naomi does manage to stand out by virtue of being one of the most character-focused endeavors to date."
Naomi,1,Ushers us into a new superhero era with a grounded outing that showcases Kaci Walfall's endearing charm as the titular character.
Naomi,1,"The first episode doesn't exactly break new ground on the superhero origin, but it does feature enough promising elements to patiently watch it play out."
Naomi,1,Naomi is so far a winning adaptation of the 2019 DC/Wonder Comics miniseries that represents a promising new day for the beleaguered network.
Naomi,1,"Naomi hits the mark when it comes to representation and empowering viewers to embrace who they are, and what makes them unique."
Naomi,1,[Naomi] is incredibly sure-footed in its heroine's path to superpowers and more... Part of that is from the sheer star power of Walfall.
Naomi,1,Amanda Marsalis delivers one of the best looking pilots I’ve seen on the CW.
Naomi,1,"Pilots are a tricky thing. Often, they either work, or they don't. And you bet a lot on a pilot because if it doesn't grip viewers, then they won't stick around. You'll want to stick around for this one."
Naomi,1,"Naomi is going to take its sweet time to explore its main character's story. And that's just fine with us, especially if it gives us more time to get to know what seems like an anomaly on TV these days, which is a teenager with her head on straight."
Naomi,1,"It's worth seeing how the show develops... But like all the newer, younger superheroes being developed for the screen over the past few years, Naomi is entering a crowded field with a lot of competition."
Naomi,1,"She could make a great superhero, but the show will have to make the journey worthwhile. The exciting thing about an uncertain future is that it's full of possibilities."
Naomi,1,"Naomi gives us a refreshing take on the Superhero Origin Story while uncovering the mystery of ""Who is Naomi""?"
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
Naomi,1,"There's some cheesy dialogue and attempts at Gen Z hipness, but the premiere of The CW's superhero mystery Naomi shows promise with a compelling hook."
Naomi,1,his deliberately presented origin story is just fresh enough to keep you curious through all of the ways that the first two episodes are clumsy.
Naomi,1,"The quirky and confident lead character Naomi, played by the phenomenal Kaci Walfall, will hook audiences right from the start."
Naomi,1,"Yeah, it's yet another superhero show, but this one's a winner thanks to an incredibly likable lead character, skate-boarding, comic book-loving Naomi (a winning Kaci Walfall)."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"It's a credit to the sharp writing, entertaining backdrop, and an enigmatic cast who elevate the material they're given, especially the Black girl characters."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Bright, rowdy, and lots of fun, this sparkling series endears itself to viewers with fresh, funny writing, and a quartet of lovable female characters finding their way into young womanhood."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,A new proposal worth seeing. [Full review in Spanish]

The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,Hilarious. [Full review in Spanish]
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Figuring out where you belong - or if you even want to belong - is a right of passage college will foist on you whether you like it or not. ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" gives that truism the right sort of fizzy kick."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"A paean to friendship, to self-discovery and to the networks that are foisted upon people by the mysteries of the universe -- or college administrations -- and which can sometimes, if you're incredibly lucky, yield gold. It's a joy."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"The Sex Lives of College Girls is more about emotional feelings, fun and friendship, than it is about sex. The characters are fully drawn, and their antics offer rewarding entertainment."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,The likable actors work beautifully together as the roommates learning the ways of love and money.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Despite some clunky writing, I am curious to see how each character's story unfolds, which gives me hope for a potential season two. I can envision a second season where the show musters up a little more authenticity."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,A rare TV show that really delves into the multifaceted and endlessly entertaining world of undergraduate shenanigans.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,Mindy Kaling strikes just the right comic tone in her latest series.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,0,"We've seen better depictions of college misadventures, and while most aren't as realistically inclusive as this one, neither are their mechanics as obvious."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Kaling always seems to enjoy tinkering with stock characters and story lines, and this might be her most effective fusion of classic and contemporary to date."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"After some initial hurdles, Sex Lives does pick up steam to become an engaging show, albeit one that still has significant room for growth."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,The Sex Lives of College Girls is a funny and clever ensemble piece that's extremely accessible and watchable despite what the racy title implies.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"This show is really good at approaching the nuances of racism, sexism, and class on a college campus. Especially when it comes to dismantling the idea around those issues no longer being existent due to how ""open-minded"" Gen Z folks are supposed to be."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, Sex Lives shares the same sharp, smart, and sassy comedic sensibility as Never Have I Ever, while tackling a wider range of young-adult issues."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,The way the show tackles how teens cope with sudden freedom is both funny and truthful.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Like college, the series can be a bumpy ride, but offers enough promise to transcend its freshman offering."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"For the most part, The Sex Lives of College Girls feels like the TV equivalent of dorm-room pizza: nothing novel or fancy, perhaps, but warm and gooey enough to satisfy."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"The core four work beautifully together, and the college setting makes the stuck-togetherness of such different personalities feel believable."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"If ""Sex Lives"" is in some respects a spiritual heir [to Sex and the City], it makes a strong case that meeting the next generation has more creative promise than revisiting an earlier one."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"""Sex Lives"" is not arriving to territory that feels, for lack of a better word, virgin. But it quickly stakes its claim as a likable show that understands what's specifically exciting and terrifying about arriving on campus."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"The show isn't exactly breaking new ground in terms of its romantic and identity-based storylines, but it approaches each girl's predicaments with a tangible amount of love and understanding."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"The kind of show where pretty much every cast member feels like a find, and where the natural chemistry among the central foursome adds to the series's easygoing appeal."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,1,"Even as it stumbles into some pitfalls, The Sex Lives of College Girls proves that there are plenty of ways for TV shows to tell college stories, especially when rooted in engagingly messy characters like these."
The Outsider,1,"Hopefully, The Outsider's Fincher-flavoured intensity and sharp acting performances will prove a winning combination for viewers."
The Outsider,1,The Outsider continues to hold us in deep suspense. [Full review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,"It's King's oeuvre as we've never seen it done before, with moody camerawork, taut scripts, and what at first appears to be a complete genre shift for the Master of Horror."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider is a superbly written, shot and acted miniseries, that is not to be missed, whether one is a Stephen King fan or not."
The Outsider,1,"Mendelsohn continuing his great work in TV, with another display of that distinctive brand of jittery intensity, as a Georgia cop who is faced with the grisly investigation, a particularly unpleasant and brutal murder of a child."
The Outsider,1,"Price's adaptation not only plays to the original novel's strengths, it realizes it with terrific filmmaking and some master-class acting."
The Outsider,1,"A show about loss, grief and the limits of belief. Wonderfully executed by an admirable cast. [Full review in Spanish]."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider is a slow burn from the start, but still kept me on the edge of my seat. With multiple twists and turns, it is a true thriller - and more than worth a binge."
The Outsider,1,Molly is already one of the female characters of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,"From the opening moments of the show, it laid itself out as much of a mood piece as a procedural...Every single shot was framed for maximum weirdness and tension."
The Outsider,1,[A] masterly adaptation.
The Outsider,1,Don't watch this one alone. It can creep you out.
The Outsider,0,"Price, an excellent screenwriter and novelist in his own right, played down The Outsider's supernatural elements so much, it was almost as if he was ashamed to embrace horror, in case it dented the miniseries' prestige TV aspirations."
The Outsider,1,"Much like Holly convincing cops to believe in monsters, the entire cast gives understated, realistic performances, making this one of the best horror series in a while - particularly for skeptics."
The Outsider,1,"A stellar cast includes Bateman, Ben Mendelsohn, Cynthia Erivo and a whole host of others, not to mention fine scripts by the highly gifted Richard Price."
The Outsider,1,"The story is a slog, though, and I think it's the biggest hurdle viewers will face. Assuming it ends well, I feel like The Outsider would work better as a binge watch."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider pulls off a remarkable high-wire balancing act... It's classic King, this eruption of the otherworldly in the midst of Middle American normality."
The Outsider,1,[H]aunting in the very best sense of the word.
The Outsider,1,"Dark Stephen King adaptation is violent, slow."
The Outsider,1,The revelations are delivered too slowly. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,"Hauntingly real and respectfully adhering to its book form from the outset, this is not only a win for Stephen King's 'Constant Readers', but it's also an absolute must-see for those that crave seriously intense thrillers."
The Outsider,1,"I think in the long run it is worth at least one watch-through, but you will have to get through the less interesting first few episodes to get to some actual meat."
The Outsider,1,The story's remorselessly tightening grip is underpinned by the way the unfolding weirdness is kept firmly anchored in daily lives and humdrum detail.
The Outsider,1,"Quite whether it needed to be this bloody slow, or all the jails and strip joints and forests in Georgia seemingly filmed through that same cowl, is up for debate. For all that, if you allow this to grab, it will."
The Outsider,1,"The whirlingly macabre, ruthlessly tense, and transfixingly spooky mood of The Outsider makes the mini-series a must-see this spring."
The Outsider,1,Richard Price did an excellent job in maintaining the suspense and terror in each of the episodes. [Full review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,Richard Price's adaptation... does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,"The fear is tangible. So is the grief. How quickly tragedy can strike, and how inexplicable it can seem. But there is a purpose here, and as is the case with so much of Stephen King's work, that purpose is rooted in hatred and evil."
The Outsider,1,"Once ""The Outsider"" becomes more of a conventional thriller, trading over some of its atmosphere for more classic suspense and twists, it still never loses its depths."
The Outsider,1,"It remains to be seen whether The Outsider can pull off its pivot into the paranormal and deliver a satisfying pay-off. However, this opening bill certainly haunted the imagination."
The Outsider,1,"The details pile up, but intrigue fails to mount... Thank God, then, for the arrival of Cynthia Erivo as Holly Gibney, whose performance is so good that it slaps you awake."
The Outsider,1,"HBO's choice to air these first two unrelentingly grim episodes back to back is a smart one-and not just because it's the perfect set-up for some clever, tension-easing joke about how director and star Jason Bateman can possibly be in two places at once."
The Outsider,1,"Although this adaptation is too well-heeled for its pulpy material, the show has a terrific plot hook, and once I made peace with its moody rhythms, I found myself hooked, devouring the six hours available for preview in two nights."
The Outsider,1,HBO's The Outsider is a sinister slow-burn that makes us care about the characters before unleashing its bogeyman.
The Outsider,1,"Ben Mendelsohn is masterful as a troubled cop consumed by the case; Cynthia Erivo, recently of Harriet, may be even better as a kind of awkward genius savant private detective who looks even deeper."
The Outsider,0,To have a work of ostensible horror that keeps undermining the ideas and conventions of the genre feels like an odd kind of compromise.
The Outsider,1,"Like all of Stephen King's work, this adaptation of The Outsider works on a lot of levels. When it wants to be tense or shocking, it succeeds via words, visuals, or both."
The Outsider,1,"Every character finds themselves up against something they cannot comprehend, something that normal life cannot explain. That's an exciting angle to take a crime drama, as the question of why is as pertinent as the question of how."
The Outsider,1,"Although Erivo stands out, the directors and Price, who writes six of the series' 10 episodes, give an outstanding cast a full palette of mourning tones to work with."
The Outsider,1,"Because True Detective has been essential in HBO's history, some of its echoes reappear here, in a more urban environment that is less attached to the tradition of the southern gothic, but with a clear ominous style. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider differs in many aspects to the others, putting a fresh and exciting spin on the genre."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider offers terrific performances, beguiling yet careful storytelling, and no shortage of genuinely terrifying moments."
The Outsider,1,"A mystery wrapped in a psychological thriller wrapped in a gruesome narrative, with great performances and a style that purposely makes a viewer squirm."
The Outsider,1,"""The Outsider"" is a largely downcast affair... But it's a compelling lament, one that has its feet on the ground as it reaches into the beyond."
The Outsider,1,"This is a great-looking show with brilliant work in particular from Mendelsohn and Erivo, who should be remembered come next awards season cycle."
The Outsider,0,Chris Carter could have nailed this material efficiently in a two-hour X-Files episode.
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
The Outsider,0,"""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse."
The Outsider,0,"There are a lot of cracks in The Outsider, and not even the glue provided by great acting and skilled directing can completely fill them."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider is the True Detective season we've all been waiting for. It's appointment television, the kind you want to keep talking about, the kind you want to keep solving. Constant Readers, call that a page turner."
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider works. Like any good King adapter, Price hews close to King's original plot while relying on his own strengths to give the world an evocative visual palette and characters that feel truly alive within it."
The Outsider,1,"""The Outsider"" series wisely appears to trim a good deal of King's novel, leaving a more streamlined horror story that goes beyond the evil of what men -or boogeymen - do."
The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer."
The Outsider,1,"Enveloping and kind of exhausting, a deliberate, ponderous mystery that grinds and allures."
The Outsider,1,"What's most pleasant, if that's the word, about ""The Outsider"" is its emphasis on classic ordinary-mortal shoe-leather investigation - no supercomputers or genius hackers getting results at warp speed, relatively little action even advanced by telephone."
The Outsider,1,"Stephen King adaptations have a spotty track record, one that isn't helped by the sheer abundance of them. HBO's The Outsider bucks those odds, delivering a taut, noir-ish thriller."
The Outsider,1,"Incredible cast, dynamite opening, too-leisurely progression, overly familiar execution. Watch with care, but watch."
The Outsider,1,It's fascinating to see Stephen King's familiar themes (grief) and tropes (people controlled by a malevolent force) rendered in the somber tones of an HBO drama.
The Outsider,1,"The Outsider is deluxe King, befitting a tall tale that gains imaginative power by slowly weaving its spooky and supernatural elements into a gripping detective story. It all feels so real-until it doesn't."
The Outsider,0,"Slowness, however, is not the issue; nor does it seem right to peg it all on tone. The characters keep remarking that something just doesn't add up. It's as if they're writing this review themselves."
The Outsider,1,"With the help of a great cast (led by Ben Mendelsohn) and eerie, stark direction from Emmy-winner Jason Bateman, ""The Outsider"" isn't on the level of Price's past work - but it's far better than this story has any right to be."
The Outsider,1,"Lugubrious, also highly watchable."
The Outsider,0,"Like so many of King's mammoth tomes, The Outsider could easily have been distilled into a movie. Instead, we get a 10-episode slog through crime-drama cliché so oppressive, it threatens to overshadow Erivo's brilliance."
The Outsider,0,"Like the Stephen King novel it's based upon, The Outsider is an interesting, but not completely satisfying experiment... Even with Erivo and Mendelsohn as sturdy stars, ]it] hasn't quite found a way to give its plunge into the unknown the juice it needs."
The Outsider,0,"It's refreshing for film and TV producers to take King's work as seriously as his readers do, but The Outsider proves that the solemn approach can go too far."
The Outsider,1,A masterclass on how to do the slow-burn right.
The Outsider,1,"Thanks to an exceptional cast and chilling direction, The Outsider will become your latest twisted, thrilling, and terrifying true-crime obsession."
The Outsider,0,"The performers are all strong, but in service of storytelling that doesn't always deserve them. Imagine the more overheated aspects of True Detective, but with more blatant nods to demons and far less impressive visuals."
The Outsider,1,The series preserves Stephen King novel's ingenious plot while entirely altering its tone.
The Outsider,1,Captivating. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Outsider,1,The excellent acting and King's keen eye for socio-political undercurrents and themes like trauma make it a solid watch.
The Outsider,1,"Adapted by The Wire writer Richard Price, HBO's The Outsider is the ultimate tale of otherworldly nightmares creeping into our existence."
The Boondocks,1,"This season has had very little as far as actual social commentary, real satire, or any of the insights you'd normally expect from this show."
The Boondocks,1,"From its gorgeous backgrounds and the jazz-like quality of its stories to its consistently on-point writing, this is one of those shows you'll throw on in the background one minute only to start obsessively watching the next."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
The Boondocks,1,"But Season 4's shaky landing was not disappointing enough to undo the show's legacy-which, by the way, includes a Peabody award for one particularly controversial episode."
The Boondocks,0,"It's a zombie show, like the Dan Harmon-less fourth season of Community. Something's off. You can't figure out exactly what, but you can feel it."
The Boondocks,0,"The new season is a copy of McGruder's baby made from a printer that needs a fresh ink cartridge. The clear, hard lines of McGruder's vision and sensibility aren't the only things that are a little faded."
The Boondocks,0,The thrill is gone.
The Boondocks,1,"As ever on The Boondocks, the sparks will fly."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"He might be incredible wealthy but he has a bloodhound’s scent for the cliches of our existence, however slight and trivial they might be."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"At this point, Curb Your Enthusiasm isn't just prettay prettay good, it's prettay prettay damn near flawless."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,0,"The whimsy on the show is now so ethereal it barely registers. The setups can be achingly obvious and the punchlines disappointing. Besides, an ever more elderly Larry David as a single guy ambling round LA is getting tiresome."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"There is such a thing as too much Larry David, but to be honest, if the first hints of this latest season are anything to go by, he's never been in better form."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,Seems as sturdy as David's comedic delivery and Larry's ego.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"David has elevated petty self-righteousness, explosive, expletive-laden squabbling and social solecism into an art form."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,The funniest man on television is back in his element-and thank goodness for that.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,It's an ingenious Larry David way to address the elephant in the room.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,It's a perfect formula.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"Season 11 is still working for our laughter, even as the music plays on."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"Like Hamm, Brooks is a great addition to Curb's roster."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"At its best, and 47 Emmy nominations attest to its quality, it is awfully hard to beat when it comes to compelling, binge-worthy comedy."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"It's that rare comedy that, to me, did not lapse into self-parody by season 6 or 7. The premiere was decent enough -- not a standout, but there were moments."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"Over such a long, indefatigable lifespan, Larry David and the rest of the cast and writers have constructed a formula that's virtually foolproof, and Season 11's shows no signs of strain in their comedy firmament."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"While the last few seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm can't match the consistency of its earlier ones, there are always funny moments when Larry complains about something and/or he gets his comeuppance for his grouchiness."
Curb Your Enthusiasm,1,"Pretty, pretty good."
His Dark Materials,1,The second season of the series takes a big step forward and deserves to be recognized as one of HBO's most beautiful and enthralling new shows.
His Dark Materials,1,"The first season jumped that hurdle easily, but as with any second series, book or album, the follow-up must give fans more of the same, while adding new elements to sustain interest. His Dark Materials season two does all that and more."
His Dark Materials,1,"What the show suffers from in its deepest form, and keeps it from being as great as it could be, is its inability to create a sense of wonder."
His Dark Materials,1,"The show does not break new ground, but fans of the original story-or anyone who is curious about worlds where souls exist in animal form outside of the body-will find a layered story with tender performances."
His Dark Materials,1,Pits [Dafne Keen] against one of the best child actors in the prestige TV landscape.
His Dark Materials,1,"Season Two may lack the spectacle of Season One's frozen north and armoured bears, but it deepens the worlds and characters of His Dark Materials."
His Dark Materials,1,This oozes quality and beats the first series.
His Dark Materials,1,"The improvements are everywhere, beginning with Lyra... Taking her out of her comfort zone and allowing her to view things with awe helps restore the wonder and magic the first season lacked."
His Dark Materials,1,"""The City Of Magpies"" is at its best when it's focused on Lyra."
His Dark Materials,1,"Thematically darkness and light are perfectly balanced as Jack Thorne shares conversations, shapes character dynamics and tees up emotional pay offs."
His Dark Materials,1,"As much as I wish Season 2 found a way to narratively pull through, it's still as dark, mystical, and philosophically intriguing as Season 1 - so if you're a returning viewer, you'll probably like it. You just won't be wowed by it."
His Dark Materials,1,His Dark Materials feels grander and less cramped than before - finally living up to its epic fantasy ambitions it had from the beginning.
His Dark Materials,1,"Jack Thorne's scriptwriting remains tack-sharp, and there was none of that B-standard stage-school acting you often get from middle-class English kids."
His Dark Materials,1,"[The premiere] is a fun start, and the way both Lyra and Will bounce off each other, personality-wise, is an exciting thing to see so soon."
His Dark Materials,1,"It was Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter who ramped up the terror, using only ordinary household items. Icy and understated, a vision of evil in scarlet body-con."
His Dark Materials,0,"For a story centered on the exploits of a frightened, isolated teenager, the show remains remarkably devoid of any sense of fear, excitement, or passion."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
His Dark Materials,0,"[Though] it's timely and relevant in places, His Dark Materials season 2 can't shake off the feeling everything it attempts has been done better elsewhere before."
His Dark Materials,1,"The action is picking up, the scope of the universes is expanding, and the stakes are becoming clearer ... With luck, this show just might find its soul yet."
His Dark Materials,1,"The central children are brilliant and Jade Anouka a welcome addition as witch queen Ruta Skadi, but it's the baddies that really make this series -- still a horrible joy is Ruth Wilson as the ruthless, devious Mrs Coulter,"
His Dark Materials,1,"His Dark Materials finally feels as though it has found its groove in its second season. The series feels more lush, propulsive, and epic than it ever has before, with a tightly paced plot and characters we can actually care about."
His Dark Materials,1,"In its second season, His Dark Materials is a thrilling adventure. Not only does it improve and expand upon Season 1, it delves into new ideas and realities that make for a tauter, more exciting story."
His Dark Materials,1,"This is the epic adventure we all needed during 2020. If you missed the first season, go back and binge it now because His Dark Materials second season is ready to blow you away."
His Dark Materials,1,Actress Ruth Wilson is at her scene-stealing best with a performance that's both seductive and chilling.
His Dark Materials,1,"It's functional above all else, then, but [the premiere] is nonetheless an excellent introduction to the new characters, new worlds, and new ideas that'll hopefully come to define this sophomore outing."
His Dark Materials,1,"Witches, spectres, angels... there's always been something weird and difficult about His Dark Materials, whose setting is so richly fantastical, but also intercuts with our own world."
His Dark Materials,0,"It's hard to imagine any teenage fan of fantasy adventure, raised on Star Wars and superhero movies, sitting through even ten minutes of this coalescing sludge."
His Dark Materials,1,"Whilst there is more of the same from last season, this is no bad thing in a show as well made as His Dark Materials. It has all the allure, charm, wit and intelligence needed for a family adventure yarn that refuses to talk down to its audience."
His Dark Materials,1,"The season 2 premiere of His Dark Materials sets up the rest of the season nicely, gently introducing viewers to new worlds, characters and concepts."
His Dark Materials,1,"His Dark Materials looks great, it's robustly made, and there are great actors everywhere, occupying well-built universes. But it doesn't doesn't inspire as much wonder as it ought to."
His Dark Materials,1,"This gives the director, Tom Hooper, free rein to imagine what Pullman's worlds look like, and most of what he imagines works well."
His Dark Materials,0,"For avid Pullman fans, the series might be a treat. The problem for the rest of us is that it lacks both the novelty of series one and the exciting narrative - it now feels very dense, which works well in a novel but less so in a TV series."
His Dark Materials,1,"Luxury casting has its drawbacks... On series two, it simply means we don't see enough of James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Conversely, sometimes there's rather too much background pushing its way to the foreground."
Person of Interest,1,Team Machine returns after a year-long hiatus with a bang.
Person of Interest,1,All of these character episodes would be just average episodes of Person of Interest if we weren't constantly aware that this was the last season.
Person of Interest,1,I haven't caught this many feels about technology since the movie Her.
Person of Interest,1,This was a fantastic start to the final season and further highlighted just how far the series has come since its early days of churning out cases of the week.
Person of Interest,1,"A strong return, and a good set-up for this stretch run."
Person of Interest,1,"The implication is clear: If we survive the coming AI war, it won't be because we've placated either superintelligence; it will be because we've remembered what makes us human in the first place."
Person of Interest,1,"""return 0"" is a perfect series finale."
Person of Interest,1,"One refrain from the series remained unambiguous, and that was the idea that we cannot legislate away our powerful new surveillance tech. We can't nuke it from orbit; we can't shut it down."
Person of Interest,1,... a terrific narrative gimmick in one of the smartest and most cleverly constructed thrillers on TV.
Person of Interest,1,Human involvement in this war of the machines felt more important than ever.
Person of Interest,1,"Person of Interest remains a strong series for CBS, and while it seems more like the network is trying to burn these last 13 episodes off, the show is still deserving of the chance to wrap its story up the way it sees fit."
Person of Interest,1,"Michael Emerson is so good. Yes, we all know this. But what would this show be without him, basically, acting opposite no one - a screen - and giving us such emotional moments?"
Person of Interest,1,Person Of Interest is back for a final hurrah and the fan service is in full gear.
Person of Interest,1,"Mr. Emerson has to play a number of very emotional scenes with a computer monitor, carrying on passionate conversations with the blinking cursor. Not one moment of this will tempt you to laugh (in fact, you might have to blink back a tear)."
True Blood,1,True Blood probably can't be described as a total success but surely we can celebrate its manic energy and refusal to accept the grimness of realism.
True Blood,0,If there's any show that should go out with a bang it should be this one. Right now its looking like its going to be all whimper.
True Blood,0,"So endeth True Blood, with the anemia we'd come to expect in recent years."
True Blood,1,"True Blood is wildly entertaining, what with its peek into the seamy underbelly of vampire politics, the integration of several supernatural species, and small town life/afterlife."
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
True Blood,0,"This is a show so stuck in a quagmire of nonsense that it introduced a ridiculous six-month time jump in last season's finale to get out of the nonsense -- and yet when the show picks up here, it becomes clear it is still stuck in a quagmire of nonsense."
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
True Blood,1,"Moments into True Blood Season 7 Episode 1, fans were hit with the first of what will surely be a multitude of shockers."
True Blood,1,"Even though it started with a feeding frenzy and splintered off into a series of independent storylines, ""Jesus Gonna Be Here"" did a brilliant job of uniting Sookie, Bill, Alcide, Jason, Pam and the rest of Bon Temps in a haze of fearful determination."
True Blood,0,"In its final season, the series seems to have exhausted its stores of surprises."
True Blood,0,Someone should have put a stake in this show years ago.
True Blood,1,"Let the roaring rampage, with all its accompanying loss of lives and clothing, begin."
True Blood,1,"The opening scene makes True Blood look a little too much like The Walking Dead: Hep-V-infected vampires are pulling bodies out of cars, feasting on flesh, and kidnapping people from Bellefleur's. Luckily, they're also killing superfluous plotlines."
True Blood,1,The potential definitely is there for a bloody good finale.
True Blood,1,Blood is moving in a different direction.
True Blood,0,People can debate when True Blood's creative rigor mortis officially set in but suffice it to say this once-significant and hugely lucrative HBO series limps into its seventh and final season looking pretty anemic.
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
The Undoing,0,"Like the seemingly perfect lives of its characters, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny."
The Undoing,1,"These two are so good, in fact, that it's not easy to tell whether The Undoing is properly great or just a run-of-the-mill thriller with a brilliant casting director. Either way, though, I can't wait to find out what happens."
The Undoing,1,"All in all, this is a must-watch piece of telly that boasts two of the year's most compelling leads in Jonathan and Grace."
The Undoing,1,Another great series from the hand of David E. Kelly. [Full review in Spanish]
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
The Undoing,1,"...while The Undoing offers plenty of glamour and glitz, there's a fierce moral about the place of women in today's society that's well worth exhuming..."
The Undoing,1,"Outstanding casting, sharp writing, and excellent directing make this mini-series engaging."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is, at times, a lesson at why it's often best not to overthink TV dramas."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes."
The Undoing,0,"Indeed, the show seems to relish the disorder that the Frasers cause in other people's lives, the pain they mete out. Throughout it all, the family remains static: glamorous, somehow still in control."
The Undoing,1,"Cheesy, sure, with many a would-that-really-happen moment, but viewers were swept along in fine, film noir style."
The Undoing,1,"It was a fun ride, and a swanky ride, and a grippingly involving ride -- whodunnit?, who? -- even if it was ultimately silly."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is a schlocky, high-budget thriller, an anxiety-laden romp, and the perfect vessel for the bulk of 2020's ambient, jittering neuroses."
The Undoing,1,Keeps us hooked from beginning to the end of its six chapters. [Full review in Spanish]
The Undoing,1,"Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant are superb in this suspenseful, addictive crime thriller, revolving around the dilemma: 'Who can I trust?'"
The Undoing,0,It was a bumpy flight that wound up in a dingy parking lot.
The Undoing,1,It's possible that old hippies could get high just by turning down the sound on The Undoing and staring at the kaleidoscopic clothes.
The Undoing,1,An addictive whodunnit thriller that will have your mind racing with suspicions.
The Undoing,1,"Once I came to terms with my disappointment at being wrong, I realized that The Undoing had done something far more clever in the way it unfolded."
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
The Undoing,1,The power of Kidman's performance is her ability to shift among multiple selves... Kidman communicates the changes in Grace through everything from speech to body language to appearance. It's a masterful performance.
The Undoing,1,"With the unbingeable ""Undoing,"" you're forced to stop and appreciate the dialogue, the knowing glances, the beautiful New York cinematography, the COATS."
The Undoing,0,It's the kind of mottled prestige drama that's urgent but without purpose -- like a toy that's been wound-up and keeps jumping around until the mechanism is exhausted.
The Undoing,1,"Part of the pleasure of shows like ""The Undoing"" is their characters' relative financial freedom, which allows them the time to do things such as plan a fund-raiser or, perhaps, a murder."
The Undoing,1,"It's a dark impulse, but the show manages to feed on it without giving in to schlock; a harder feat, perhaps, than choosing the right person to marry."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing feels old fashioned in construction but somehow skirts close to contemporary without seeming to try, offering up solid entertainment from a killer cast."
The Undoing,0,"No matter how much you crave kitchen islands, beige cashmere and Central Park in the snow, I'd be willing to bet you won't want to keep watching The Undoing beyond episode two."
The Undoing,1,"I'm certainly obsessed with the apartments, the furniture, the wardrobes which are not so much walk-in as yomp-around and the crimson walls of Grace's place."
The Undoing,1,"It's Kidman who is most impressive, though. She has already delivered one of the best performances of her career in the first two episodes of The Undoing, with Kelley's material clearly getting the most out of her once again."
The Undoing,1,"However, here the chief delight was also reassuringly familiar: watching wealthy people having a terrible time."
The Undoing,1,"I'm happy not to provide spoilers, because for once it's not all instantly streamable - but I'm up to episode five (of six) and safe to say still gripped."
The Undoing,1,"A murder affects the lives of the well to do in New York. Kidman, Grant and especially Donald Sutherland make it well worth your time to watch."
The Undoing,0,"HBO assembled an A-team, but failed to match them to a project worthy of their talents."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
The Undoing,1,"The first episode really is terrific, just less so than Big Little Lies. Still, it's worth seeing for the Kidman-Grant acting duel and Donald Sutherland as Kidman's infinitely arrogant and judgmental father."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
The Undoing,1,There are twists and turns throughout that keep you hooked. You also constantly question what each character is going to do next.
The Undoing,1,"Bier effortlessly waves the wand of suspicion in every direction. Watching the series through once leaves you with a raft of clues. Staggeringly, watching it through a second time seems to unearth even more."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is fine. This is thanks entirely to the strength of its cast, and had the show trusted more in that and less into making it a quasi-murder mystery, it might have landed better."
The Undoing,1,"While there is a slight lack of ambition behind its casting and execution, the series remains a highly entertaining watch with a compelling mystery that viewers will be compelled to see through to the end."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing has an uncanny knack of digging its fingers under your skin. That's because, above all, it's a show which, though you might hate yourself for it, leaves you with the nagging need to know which of these rich folks is the rottenest of them all."
The Undoing,1,It's visually refreshing... within the glossy confines of the genre.
The Undoing,1,Plenty of pedigree wattage has been packed into this slickly addictive new HBO drama.
The Undoing,1,I could watch Grant all day as Jonathan Fraser.
The Undoing,1,"The whole thing was delicious fun but wafer thin, as superficial as the cheer for diversity at the auction and kept afloat largely by Kidman's typically poised and enigmatic turn."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is a glossy addictive mystery and there's satisfaction in spending time with the elite, especially when they are being toppled from their thrones."
The Undoing,1,"The juicy, sexy, dark, over-the-top opulent follow up to Big Little Lies that I've been craving."
The Undoing,1,Grant's shifty demeanour makes for such a perfectly combustible match with Kidman's brittle elegance that it is a surprise they haven't been paired together before.
The Undoing,1,A twisty thriller that is glossy and decadently mysterious
The Undoing,1,"Hugh Grant, once known for his affable roles as the bumbling male love interest in many romantic comedies, ensured that Jonathan Fraser seemed just this side of a skeevy psychopath."
The Undoing,1,It's a soap neatly wrapped in prestige finery that begs you to get a little turnt on a Sunday.
The Undoing,1,"It's the kind of role that could easily turn toward hokey, but Kidman is able to bring such empathy and intensity to the part, holding the show on her shoulders and doing so gracefully."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing nods towards its characters' manifold privileges, but never quite manages to probe any further than surface level. As soapy melodrama or a glamorous whodunnit, though, it is unimpeachable."
The Undoing,1,"Again, from the first episode at least, it appears to be about deceit and the way it can create serious delusions beyond our control, often with heartbreaking consequences."
The Undoing,1,"It's a compelling potboiler, albeit one cooked up in a Le Creuset pot: the Upper East Side morality an embarrassment of riches, the cast equally so"
The Undoing,1,"An enjoyable enough treat. Add in an extremely hooky whodunnit after a gruesome murder is committed, and you have six weekly episodes that won't come around quickly enough."
The Undoing,1,Magnificent tension-building direction from dynamite Danish director Susanne Bier.
The Undoing,1,A curiously one-note affair with nonetheless impeccable performances.
The Undoing,1,"[David E. Kelly] keeps the pace going even though we're so often put off by the characters, we care just a little less about what's going on."
The Undoing,1,The Undoing is definitely not the same type of story as Big Little Lies but it does have enough going for it that you will likely be tuning in over the six weeks the series airs on HBO and may even enjoy it as a binge once all episodes are available.
The Undoing,0,"The story has gossipy moms, an elite school and a murder investigation. Yet neither the sharp performances nor the lush window dressing can save scripts that have so little to say."
The Undoing,0,"""The Undoing"" is somewhat undone by its dawdling pace."
The Undoing,1,"Exquisitely written and acted, melding doubt, tension, wit and occasional outright terror into simmering pots of dread."
The Undoing,1,"Taken strictly on its own terms as the TV equivalent of summer beach reading, The Undoing is broadly entertaining, but it's hard to evaluate such a project in a vacuum given the abundance of similarly themed fare."
The Undoing,1,"""The Undoing"" is bathed in rich, autumnal colors as we quickly get to the trial portion of the proceedings, which of course feature all sorts of goings-on you'd never see in real life. But who cares."
The Undoing,1,"Kidman does most of the heavy lifting here, and not surprisingly, she's terrific."
The Undoing,1,"Guided by Susanne Bier's taut direction, the twists keep coming and nothing is quite what it seems."
The Undoing,1,"I'm not going to say any more about what happens in ""The Undoing."" I don't want to give it away. But Nicole Kidman at the center of it all delivers one of the best and most nuanced roles of her entire career."
The Undoing,1,I was so shocked and riveted that I'm counting the days until I can see how it all ends in that final chapter. Exactly how a great page-turner is supposed to work.
The Undoing,1,"It's no masterpiece, but terrifically loaded with twists."
The Undoing,1,The narrative starts to gel once Kidman begins attempting to navigate the mess her life has become. It's what makes Big Little Lies thrive and The Undoing a good show.
The Undoing,0,"A bad man getting away with a bad thing? Lawyers obfuscating the wheels of justice? It's all too familiar. And perhaps this is just 2020 talking, but it's a little exhausting, too."
The Undoing,1,"Kidman is the mistress of vulpine consternation, and her bohemian wardrobe, all droopy textured coats and flowing dresses, looks like a leftover from when she played Virginia Woolf."
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
The Undoing,1,"Ms. Bier has, in subtle ways, brought a cinematic quality to the Kelley TV formula, although one person's Emmy-aspiring drama is still another person's wealth porn. The Undoing is plush to the point of voyeuristic ecstasy."
The Undoing,0,"Kidman is fine from moment to moment, but her character is tossed about so, as facts turn to lies and lies look like facts, that a whole person hardly comes together - she seems held together by shellac."
The Undoing,0,"This should all be sexily entertaining, and even fun, with Kidman and Hugh Grant playing Grace and Jonathan, and Kelley supplying the banter they exchange around the townhouse kitchen island. And for one episode it is."
The Undoing,0,The murder case wends its way to trial while more revelations come to light. By the fifth episode the story feels fully spent and too thinly stretched. Beauty and mood can take things only so far.
The Undoing,0,The Undoing becomes overly long and formulaic. It's less interesting than Big Little Lies and has less on its mind socio-politically than Little Fires Everywhere.
The Undoing,0,"Even if ""The Undoing"" finds its way around to acknowledging its rich, white protagonists are bad people - and they definitely are - it's already too late to turn the six-episode series into a scathing censure on privilege."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing has the potential to be more substantive than it is, and it's a little disappointing that it isn't. Still, it offers a moody sense of atmosphere, a welcome reminder of New York's pre-pandemic days,"
The Undoing,0,"It's all extremely rote, like an expanded version of the mid-budget Nineties movie that would have starred Kidman and Grant at their respective heights of celebrity."
The Undoing,1,"Director Susanne Bier plays on the Hitchcockian elements. The Danish filmmaker behind Bird Box and The Night Manager has a purposeful, and personal, way of framing characters and events, without getting in the way."
The Undoing,1,"It's fun to watch Grant in action, dodging our presumptions about his character. Kidman is good, too, if a bit distractingly waxen."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has undeniably high production values and a top-notch cast, but they're in service of increasingly lackluster and inconsistent storytelling."
The Undoing,1,[Hugh] Grant gives a career-defining performance by taking his signature charm and transforming it into something self-serving and manipulative.
The Undoing,1,"Admittedly, the plot detours into generic and less enigmatic territory midway, but that hardly undoes the entire endeavour."
The Undoing,1,"Given its strong start, it'd be a shame if The Undoing comes undone at the end and fails to stick its landing, but I'll be sticking with it through to the end, if only to see whether Grace and Jonathan's marriage survives."
The Undoing,1,"An always watchable murder mystery, it never becomes completely gripping, neither a nuanced study of a wealthy family falling apart or a trashy melodrama where Nicole Kidman loses it over six episodes.."
The Undoing,1,"Sure, it has themes of class and privilege, but The Undoing is really as weightless and as delightful as the soap bubbles that float across the screen in the opening credits."
The Undoing,1,"Susanne Bier's sturdy craft makes for an entertaining, compelling show even when the writing veers towards the melodramatic and ridiculous."
The Undoing,1,"Go for the high-wattage cast, gorgeous outfits and stunning homes; stay for the secrets, twists and shocks. The Undoing is perfect entertainment for a cold-weather, stay-at-home time."
The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows."
The Undoing,0,"It's almost hard to believe that stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, series writer David E. Kelley and series director Susanne Bier could come up with a show so limp, so generic, so dispiritingly bad as this six-hour drama."
The Undoing,0,"Not even Kidman's performance, nor sharp turns from the likes of Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland, can quite center its diffuse interests."
The Undoing,1,"It cannot be overstated that Kelley has created a crackling mystery with terrific actors. But ultimately, it has nothing to say."
The Undoing,1,"Through all of the misdirects, the characters' dumb decisions, the dreamy detours, The Undoing kept me guessing - and, of course, gloating over everyone's misfortune."
The Undoing,1,"The Undoing is a riveting, visually stunning, and enigmatic thriller that features magnetic lead performances from Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant."
The Undoing,1,"Even though many viewers will easily be able to sniff out what's coming next, that's perhaps not so important as spending time with the four main characters..."
The Undoing,1,"It's best to strap into this smartly paced, beautifully acted, profoundly suspenseful roller coaster blindly, as I did."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"While fans of the show's first season will likely enjoy the second, its humor too often falls into the habit of reveling in the dumb, gross, and broadly obnoxious."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,It’s odd to think that a comedy that trafficks so heavily in sophomoric humor can also be filled with love. But that’s what McBride excels in: the ability to hold seemingly opposing natures in one entity at any given time.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,I sort of ditched on Season One...then I binged the first 4 episodes of Season 2...now I am going back and watching rest of Season One. I was wrong to quit...this show is hilarious.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"Gemstones is brave, and I want it to explore rather than shy away from all that subtext—which is that straight white men are straight white men because the rest of us are not."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"This new season of The Righteous Gemstones is the first great comedy show of 2022, a brilliant combination of insanity and surprising heart."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"The Righteous Gemstones is as uproarious as ever in its second season, delivering laughs and horrified gasps with every scene. Praise be."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"Continues its brilliantly funny look at, how in America, even religion is quite literally business as usual."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"It's got the ideas, characters, and production values to match the outsized egos strutting through its story."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,The Gemstones have lost none of their luster.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"It is a comedy with every fiber of its being, and the funniest one currently on air."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"Season two of ""The Righteous Gemstones"" is an ambitious, intermittently hysterical mess. McBride and Hill attempt to expand the show outward, often into full-on action set pieces that, while impressive, fail to find cohesion with the rest of the series."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"These shows masterfully combine the outsized and the subdued, contrasting broad, loud, propulsive comedy with surprisingly nuanced characterizations and a believable setting."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,A clever nine-episode sophomore outing that's sharply written and often very funny.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"Season 2 raises the stakes and dives deep into the past of the Gemstones, specifically Eli, in a way that will shock most viewers."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"McBride's finesse in character development and his trust in the ensemble to bring these absurd imaginings to life are through-lines in an unevenly paced, sometimes one-note, but ultimately rewarding season."
The Righteous Gemstones,1,The series showcases a depth and maturity by spending more time excavating its evangelical empire.
The Righteous Gemstones,1,"When everything starts to break and spiral, this series continues to deliver the funny. I wish the overall story came together a bit more but there is so much good work this season that I will absolve McBride and the cast of this one little sin"
Rome,1,Over two seasons... Rome is an intricately plotted story about political power and intimate human dilemmas and crises. It makes Game of Thrones look like a game for children.
Rome,1,"The writers are careful to make their most daring historical reaches plausible, consistent, and, of course, dramatically effective."
Rome,1,"These Romans are worth following to the end of the road, no matter how well-traveled it might be."
Rome,1,"""Rome"" is smart, dirty fun."
Rome,1,"This hearty, meaty dish is nicely seasoned with humour."
Rome,1,Shoots hot-blooded f---ing and gruesome death into your veins with a big syringe. It's electroshock historicism. And it's a big part of the reason why Rome is so powerful.
Rome,1,A gorgeous blend of style and substance... It's hard to get down on a show for being too ambitious when so few programs think to color outside of the lines.
Rome,1,This is Horrible Histories for grownups.
Rome,1,Enjoy the empire. While it lasts.
Rome,1,Contributing to the sense of loss is that Rome accomplished what any successful drama must do - it got viewers to care deeply about the characters.
Rome,0,Lacks the strong perspective of a passionate author with ideas and angles and a story to tell.
Rome,1,"As in season 1, the acting is rich and lusty, with no costume-drama fustiness. I especially like James Purefoy as Mark Antony."
Rome,1,Navigates the high-wire act of jumping significant periods of time between episodes - sometimes years - and remaining just as engrossing as episodes in the first season.
Rome,1,Makes its own final exit in a manner that wouldn't have disgraced its historical characters.
Rome,1,Great TV... Miss it not!
Rome,1,"By challenging the liberal conviction that all power corrupts, the show, despite its flaws, has finally become a drama worthy of HBO's name."
Rome,1,"... ""Rome"" is no less compelling and addictive."
Rome,1,"Still reliably rotten, wantonly carnal, and spectacularly costumed as HBO and the BBC resume their dramatic collaboration on the world's largest standing film set at Italy's Cinecittà Studios."
Rome,1,"In Season 2, ""Rome"" has finally found its scandal footing by remembering the larger-than-life figures of the era."
Rome,1,"... with patience to reacquaint with the characters, ""Rome"" builds into a compelling, toga-clad soap opera."
Rome,0,"The creators of ""Rome"" took pains to recreate Rome as it really was, crowded, fetid, brutal and corrupt: as much ""Mad Max""as Circus Maximus. But behind all that gritty squalor the glory that was Rome gets lost."
Rome,1,"""Rome"" dramatizes, among other things, the birth of politics as usual -- and dramatizes it with the flourish of high drama and the urgency of tonight's headlines."
Rome,1,... the sheer spectacle and the pull of great events may make Rome worth your while.
Rome,1,"Though every detail of this lush Roman epic feels palpably authentic, history lessons don't loom overly large; what's most enjoyable about it is how deftly it mixes soap opera with senatorial debates."
Rome,1,"I suspect more of us will be watching ""Rome"" with greater expectations and a sharper hunger than before."
Rome,1,"Even when the narrative occasionally bogs down, the stellar and mostly European cast simply powers through it."
Rome,0,"While the look and feel of the series is still as brilliant as before, it feels wasted on these paltry scripts."
Rome,1,"This pretty much is a brutal soap opera for the ages, the bloodshed capricious and often jarring in its capacity to instill a sense of unease."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"It's an absolute mess of a show, and anyone who's watched it will agree... If you can accept that this is the show's main goal, then you can accept pretty much anything it throws at you."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"Veronica made it onto our list of TV moms, but every one of these mothers could have taken it easily. In dealing with A, they were just as much a part of the story as each of their daughters."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"We leave the show literally how it all started - a missing teenage girl, and the exact words that started that night so long ago. Let's just hope these girls don't take seven years to figure out their baggage and secrets."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"In the end, Pretty Little Liars went out with a massive bang."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"Pretty Little Liars is finally over. And while the show did its best to wrap things up, there were still plenty of moments that required a little suspension of disbelief."
Pretty Little Liars,1,"Well, my devoted, beloved power-ranking readers, it all came down to this: Our biggest, baddest big bad of them all was ... a character we didn't even meet until the final half-hour of this entire series. Amazing!"
Pretty Little Liars,0,It's time for Pretty Little Liars to put us out of our misery once and for all. It's an act of mercy that we all deserve.
Pretty Little Liars,1,"If this does indeed prove to be the final season- rumors abound that there will be a movie, or at the very least, a spin-off of some sort- then it certainly started with a bang, if this episode was any indication."
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
Batwoman,1,"""Mad as a Hatter"" not only has us ready for where the series goes next, it's re-lit our obsession with these characters and their world."
Batwoman,1,It's safe to say the third season of Batwoman will have much more direct writing than the last one and be a treat for anybody interested in the wild characters Gotham fosters.
Walker,1,"Every western show needs two feuding families, and this will add drama to Walker without it being drama within the family. From the first few minutes, tension and tempers flared and piqued my curiosity about what happened."
Deadwood,1,Might just be the finest example of world building ever committed to screen.
Deadwood,1,The injustice of a premature ending is dwarfed by the simple fact that a program this literate could win a devoted following in the era of Fear Factor and My Fair Brady.
Deadwood,1,"Despite being only three seasons long, this is one of the most sprawling series ever put on the small screen. It's a tale of greed, betrayal and all that classical good stuff."
Deadwood,1,"Oh, my goodness. Deadwood might be dirty, depraved, and dangerous, but it's never dull."
Deadwood,1,"Deadwood is that rarest of all rare birds, a great television show -- so much better than most television, that it's scarcely recognizable as a television show at all."
Deadwood,1,The sharp script never wastes a moment and occasionally the characters soar into soliloquies of Shakespearean proportions that can be befuddling but you need not understand every word -- let it all wash over you and enjoy its musicality.
Deadwood,1,"The rich, complex language of this serialised western demands attention. Almost every character has a foul mouth but the expletives that pepper the dialogue somehow intensify the moments of beauty and wisdom."
Deadwood,1,"What makes Deadwood different from earlier revisions is that it not only that it blurs the lines of right and wrong, good and evil, but erases them entirely."
Deadwood,1,"Ian McShane's Swearengen, who anchors the Old West drama Deadwood the same way James Gandolfini's Tony anchors ""The Sopranos,"" goes into the show's third season embodying all the qualities viewers used to love in Tony."
Deadwood,1,"For everyone else who has gotten past initial repugnance over the show's saltier aspects and become addicted, the third season looks to be a thrill to be savored for 12 glorious weeks."
Deadwood,1,"It's brainy and fabulously dark and soupy, and, for my money, much more human and engaging than The Wire or The Shield."
Deadwood,0,"Deadwood is a terribly, terribly hard show to love. But apparently there are some people who still do."
Deadwood,1,"The terrifically bold series never shies from violence while rewarding viewers with resonant story lines and a terrific populace of characters, some more historically based than others."
Deadwood,1,"Latecomers to this series, wanting to know what all the fuss is about, should just soak up the richest and most poetic dialogue ever to grace a TV show."
Deadwood,1,"That's the mark of a great dramatic work: when the smallest, most insignificant moments grab at your heart."
Deadwood,1,Deadwood is just littered with talent.
Deadwood,1,"Like most TV shows, it's shot well enough, and there are some incredible technicians behind the camera... But it's the language of the show that made it so beloved, and why it's one of the greats."
Deadwood,1,"It's an upsetting way for such a wonderful series to end, but looking back on Deadwood as a whole is a reminder of how wonderful the show was and how much it has to offer to old and new viewers alike... even if we all wish there was more of it to see."
Deadwood,1,"It's hard to imagine ""Deadwood"" with a different cast because the current cast makes up one of TV's best ensembles."
Deadwood,1,"The magic isn't gone, it's just that the early fireworks are missing."
Deadwood,1,"Buoyed by a top-flight cast newly augmented by Brian Cox as an old chum of Swearengen's, the show is rife with sly humor while presenting a glimpse of the West that extends beyond mere revisionism..."
Deadwood,1,"For all the artificiality of the language, there has seldom been a show that felt more authentic."
Deadwood,1,"Nevertheless, it is a show that is deeply missed. Deadwood remains a key text in the canon of modern American television."
Deadwood,0,It's like saddling up and putting the spurs to a drunk Shetland pony.
Deadwood,1,"""Deadwood"" takes you past the familiar cardboard cutouts of Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and ""the Old West,"" and acquaints you with the real forces and peoples that converged to form our country."
Deadwood,1,"Like last season, the plots are thick and quick-flying."
Deadwood,1,"Deadwood suggested that, at its best, society can even us all out, can make us realize there's more to life than our own self-interest."
Deadwood,1,"The first two seasons are solid gold, the third, flimsier, but Deadwood is about how communities get built - and all the dirty work that involves."
Deadwood,1,"With assistance from some truly memorable acting by Ian McShane, Brad Dourif and Paula Malcomson, Deadwood's sometimes over-the-top representations never veer far enough from reality for its inhabitants to become just characters."
Deadwood,1,"Despite being a decade or so older than the purported target audience, I certainly found this season difficult viewing - and certain scenes (not gratuitous but packed with emotional trauma) would doubtless be classed as ""triggering""."
Deadwood,1,"Deadwood was truly ahead of its time. If it premiered in today's prestige TV era instead of nearly 15 years ago, it could easily have doubled in seasons."
Deadwood,1,What makes Deadwood so fascinating is not the action we put up with; it's the language we listen to...
Deadwood,1,At its sharpest edge the series cuts into satire. There is a sense now the stakes are higher.
Deadwood,1,This is where Deadwood ends. It's abrupt. It's unhappy. But it does not ultimately feel untrue to the spirit of the thing.
Deadwood,1,"Overall, Deadwood: Season Three is imperfect but invigorating entertainment, vastly superior to just about any other show currently on television."
Deadwood,1,"But it is Brian Cox, as the dandy actor Jack Langrishe, who is the third season's real star."
Deadwood,1,I'll take a truncated Deadwood over most of the drivel that's on the air now.
Deadwood,1,"Watching Deadwood is like stepping into the pages of a juicy Victorian novel. Every scene teems with an enthralling, fully realized vision of life, the kind of jostling pageant of humanity on display in the most satisfying works of Dickens or Trollope."
Deadwood,1,It's as beautiful and embracing a work of art as I've ever seen.
Silicon Valley,1,It was the perfect ending that has cemented Silicon Valley as one of the most impactful and highly relevant shows we ever had.
Silicon Valley,1,I liked the sendoff.
Silicon Valley,1,"""Exit Event,"" the Silicon Valley final episode, wraps the individual and shared stories of Richard, Dinesh, Jared, Gilfoyle, Monica, and their collective nemesis Gavin Belson in a proper and satisfying way."
Silicon Valley,1,The finale that fans and - yup - Silicon Valley itself deserve.
Silicon Valley,1,"All the studies, initiatives and op-eds about this persistent discrimination are fine, but what really works in our world is the stinging bite of satire."
Silicon Valley,1,"Given the hoopla that tends to surround such farewells, it doesn't feel like Silicon Valley is going out with a bang. Yet if the series wasn't necessarily a killer app, it was, right up until the end, an extremely well-designed program."
Silicon Valley,1,It's still a very good show - and I look forward to watching the last three episodes of the season - but it's also a show that's very ready to end.
Silicon Valley,0,"[F]or a show and creator known for supreme social commentary, they both certainly have their blind spots."
Silicon Valley,1,"This season will be messy, yes, but there is lots of promise here for solid emotional payoff and satisfying returns for dedicated viewers of the show."
Silicon Valley,1,"Silicon Valley's consistency is one of its most admirable qualities. It's still a treat to sit down to new episodes of this series, trusting that each new entry will deliver the laughs and thrills you've enjoyed this whole time."
Silicon Valley,1,"The result is a season that makes it very clear Silicon Valley is going to go out on its own terms. But, unlike many other shows, Silicon Valley isn't beholden to any number of loose threads or will they or won't they romantic scenarios."
Silicon Valley,1,"They just might pull a win out in this final season-it is what they do, after all-but for the first time, it's starting to feel like a victory that might cost them everything."
Silicon Valley,1,"All three of the episodes are very strong and that's a good sign heading to the exit. You can cherish all the Gilfoyle moments, the Jian-Yang moments, Richard's continuing foibles, etc., and hope that a series of minor characters will get their cameos."
Silicon Valley,1,The sixth season premiere of Silicon Valley deftly demonstrated how upholding ethics and humane values at a successful company may be an impossible challenge.
Silicon Valley,1,"There's a fresh set of ethical dilemmas at the core of this final batch of episodes, as our nerdy heroes get close to a billion dollars but wonder at what cost: a fitting finale to one of HBO's smaller yet highly relevant shows."
Silicon Valley,1,"For years now Silicon Valley has fearlessly and hilariously spoken truth to the most terrifying source of power in our modern world, something it deftly and angrily continues to do in Season 6."
Silicon Valley,1,"Still, it feels like Silicon Valley is ending with just the right amount of gas left in its tank to finish the journey it began back in 2014. It also feels like the right time to end from a cultural standpoint."
Silicon Valley,1,Silicon Valley continues to be novel and fun in its final season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Search Party,1,"What started off as a Lynchian mystery ends in a completely different style... The series knows how to reinvent itself, sometimes in really wild ways, and becomes something truly surprising and original. [Full review in Spanish]"
Search Party,1,"The fifth season...throws caution to the wind and embraces multiple storylines pulled from popular fiction, all wrapped up in a candy-colored explosion."
Search Party,1,"It's a bizarre, totally bonkers season that keeps on upping the ante of ridiculousness."
Search Party,1,The show remains TVs most fearless comedy right up to its final shot.
Search Party,1,"What's surprisingly undeniable, however, is how satisfying a conclusion this is to the larger journey Search Party's been on this entire time."
Search Party,1,"Search Party manages to become an addiction. It's a fascinating and often ferocious take on contemporary love, friendship, fame and delusion. And yet it has heart, as Dory remains an intensely compelling character."
Search Party,1,"The metamorphosis worked for a number of reasons. On the level of storytelling, the central characters-incapable as they were of any actual growth-stayed remarkably consistent, retaining their young-Brooklynite insecurities even amid the cultists..."
Search Party,1,"The fifth and final season of Search Party is, frankly, bananas. It takes a ridiculous, ballsy, massive swerve, keeping the same familiar characters but plunging them into a quasi-alt-universe version of the Brooklyn they had previously inhabited."
Search Party,1,"The result is not just Search Party's strongest season, but bold storytelling that solidifies the series' status as one of the best and most fearless comedies of all time."
Search Party,1,"Somehow, despite the bizarre last-minute transformation, the show still ends on a resounding high note."
Search Party,1,"It's as inconsistent as the show has ever been in terms of plotting and theme, but there's also something riveting about its insane structure and ludicrous final episodes."
Search Party,1,"While it struggles under the burden of too many narrative threads, the series manages to tie its various arcs together for a delirious and riveting end."
Search Party,1,"With the most bizarre and unexpected twists, this final season completely jumps the shark. And yet somehow, it works as a whole because OF COURSE this happened to Dory & co."
The O.C.,0,"Think of ""The O.C."" as a music video and it's less painful."
The O.C.,1,"Though ""The O.C."" is unlikely to ever return to its top spot among buzzworthy shows, this latest reinvention hews true to the show's initial tone and should satisfy long-time fans."
The O.C.,0,A show that had so much juice seems to be running dry.
The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long."
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
The O.C.,1,"Creator Josh Schwartz's writing came off like a light, sharp javelin, funny and wicked in all the right spots, and the cast was charismatic perfection."
The O.C.,0,The series used up three times as much plot as any other drama around. It burned through whole arcs of character development in one episode and started repeating itself.
The O.C.,1,"Now I see what I missed: the rise of Autumn Reeser's Taylor as a fine, funny love interest for Ryan, lots of good jokes from a clearly-too-old-yet-still-game Seth, and a succession of terrific subplots and scenes for his underrated parents."
The O.C.,1,"The O.C. is once again in great creative shape, with believable storylines and plenty of the razor-sharp wit at which the series excels."
The O.C.,0,"Too ironic to be a soap, but too soapy to be a parody. Take this season's dismal debut: a clunky, dark hour in which hunky Ryan brooded... He should have mourned instead the loss of the show's last, best quality-an ability to make fun of itself."
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
The O.C.,1,"Going forward, Thursday nights will be a little less quippy, a little less pop-culture-obsessed, a little less Seth-y. And, sure, a little less sexy."
The O.C.,1,Just absolute O.C. perfection... You couldn't ask for a better parting shot.
The O.C.,1,"Television as Schadenfreude. These people might wallow in wealth, have fabulous clothes and live in ever-sunny California but they still suffered. On a daily basis. Usually because of their own stupid decisions. You just can't beat escapist TV that."
The O.C.,1,"The series did an excellent job of bringing back the strong early interaction between the main cast, and most importantly, the overall sense of fun that had been missing for so much of the previous year."
The O.C.,1,"It's probably worth sticking around a little more, since there is potential that this season could be at least kinda' back on track. But if you've already bailed on the show, I don't know that there's enough to justify a reinvestment."
The O.C.,1,"The O.C. represented a new wave in self-referential teen TV that could be just as good and clever as its ""adult"" counterparts, while also tapping into a more genuinely youthful perspective."
Six Feet Under,1,"Besides its weekly sardonic look at mortality, the shows portrayal of homosexuality and lesbianism has been unflinching."
Six Feet Under,1,"Let me say right up front that somehow Alan Ball, the creator/writer found a way to push the envelope so far that we were all left speechless. And breathless."
Six Feet Under,1,Six Feet Under is back for another season of harsh life lessons and deliciously dark humour. It has been far too long.
Six Feet Under,1,Immensely smart and elegiac. It is a fitting conclusion to what has been a magnificent fifth season for the drama.
Six Feet Under,1,"After dedicating four seasons to watching them lose loved ones, discover painful things about themselves and desperately try to change their self-destructive ways, it practically seems mandatory to discover how their journey ends."
Six Feet Under,1,The series (which underwent a creative resurrection this season) should go down in history as having the least nostalgia-laden finale in TV history.
Six Feet Under,1,"It embraced the fact that, in life and death, people are complicated and only become more so as you get to know them."
Six Feet Under,1,It's the only show I can think of that makes tragedy positively delicious and delectable.
Six Feet Under,1,"I'd put the last 10 minutes of that finale up against any series finale - it was simply the perfect way to end the show, and I'm so glad ""Six Feet Under"" went out on a high note."
Six Feet Under,0,"Now I've had it with people who insist on making themselves miserable, as if it were an art."
Six Feet Under,1,"Ball does such a good job of providing closure, and leaving characters and viewers with a memorable last chapter, that ""Six Feet Under"" instantly claims third place on the list of most memorable series finales."
Six Feet Under,1,You don't complain that your diamond could be bigger or that it's one facet isn't as shiny as the others; it's still a diamond.
Six Feet Under,1,"I have Six Feet Under to thank for teaching me that, for giving me a template for grief, for being a reflection of my own mostly indescribable, completely complicated feelings."
Six Feet Under,1,"Six Feet Under shows all of the unexpected surprises that come with losing a loved one, and reinforces the idea that these things are normal."
Six Feet Under,1,The Six Feet Under finale remains a high point of HBO history.
Six Feet Under,1,"It took chances with its storytelling, but at its heart was always a deeply familiar story of a family trying to heal itself, which is one of the most universal stories you can imagine."
Six Feet Under,1,The Fishers were endearing in their flaws and limitations.
Six Feet Under,1,"But death, ultimately, became Six Feet Under. If the show's grimly ironic voice could be too controlling, too bombastic, in its ending that voice was set free."
Six Feet Under,1,"Six Feet Under rode to an end with an operatic, bittersweet, and deeply satisfying climax."
Six Feet Under,1,"That episode and the remaining episodes of that season [five] served as both an odd comfort and, more importantly, an outlet for my own emotional release."
Six Feet Under,1,"Six Feet Under achieved a rare moment of perfection in finality, ending with a true conclusion that answering the audience's questions about the characters' fates, and even answering questions that they had not known to ask."
Six Feet Under,1,"The Fishers will always and forever be the most interesting melodramatic family rooted in the life of a funeral home, but there would be no satisfaction to that had the series finale not ended in exactly the way it did."
Six Feet Under,1,"Six Feet Under concluded with class, voluminous surprise and a tempered hope."
Six Feet Under,1,"The show, at the very end at least, finally became as much about living and escaping the fear of death, something that it probably could have been a little sooner, because the prolonged misery almost certainly lost some viewers."
Six Feet Under,1,"It's not only my belief that 'Everyone's Waiting' is the best episode of Six Feet Under, I'd say the series finale is very possibly the greatest TV finale of all time."
Six Feet Under,1,"Utterly compelling, it builds to amazing seasonal showdowns, with plenty of black humour and bitingly horrifying moments that can be hard to watch."
Six Feet Under,1,"When I watched the show, I would often dream about the characters. There was something about Six Feet Under that got to me on a profound level."
Six Feet Under,1,"To me, it was one of the most clever, funny, subversive, wicked, playful and tender shows ever to emerge from the US. It tackled the big themes: family, the importance of friendship, bonds between human beings."
Six Feet Under,1,Six Feet Under offered prime-time television viewers an unblinking vision of death and perhaps a better understanding of life.
Six Feet Under,1,"The finale montage of Episode 12 is almost unbearably moving and thrillingly executed, as we see the future fates of all these wonderful characters, realised by a remarkable ensemble."
Six Feet Under,1,"""Six Feet Under"" was a beautiful series, and its finale will suffice."
Six Feet Under,1,"If nothing else, Six Feet Under has, in a pop-cultural sense, normalized the end of life, pulling back the curtain to remind us that the process can be painful, absurd, violent, funny, peaceful, sad, and beautiful, sometimes all at once."
Six Feet Under,1,"The entire series is highly recommended, but Season Five is an exceptional achievement."
Six Feet Under,1,"... the pleasant surprise now is that ""Six Feet Under"" seems to have righted itself..."
Six Feet Under,1,The first four episodes of the final season have been stained by an ambiance of relief and finality that might accompany the passing of a loved one after a terminal illness.
The Night Of,1,"It is beautifully shot, written with a sensitive eye, and is likely to please those looking to invest time in a crime-drama that is satisfyingly gripping right until its ambiguous ending."
The Night Of,1,A captivating series that will have you hooked within minutes.
The Night Of,1,It reveals itself as a story about the difficulty -- and the danger -- of being sure... The Night of is so keen to reject the grammar of the whodunnit that it sets itself at an ironic distance from fiction.
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of didn't invent anthologies, but it's fair to credit its success with helping propel the form to its current heights."
The Night Of,1,"The worst gap between rigorous style and ridiculous substance fortunately comes early in ""The Night Of,"" which is why I can argue honestly that you should push through it to what comes after."
The Night Of,1,"The storytelling is suspenseful and cinematic; the characters complex and layered, with plot twists and turns that will keep viewers guessing throughout each of the eight episodes."
The Night Of,1,"What redeemed the show... was Ahmed's magnificent performance, and the disturbing, and convincing, coming of age his character underwent during his time behind bars."
The Night Of,1,"There are more important things to consider in ""The Night Of"" than foot fungus, but much of the show's greatness is embedded in minor details like that one, an accumulation of grace notes that bring this world and its characters to life."
The Night Of,1,"From start to finish, The Night Of thrived on the strength of its actors, particularly Ahmed and Turturro."
The Night Of,1,"This is the best thing I've ever seen Turturro do, and that's saying something."
The Night Of,1,Draining. Ambitious. And so darn good.
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is an ensemble piece, but Torturro and Riz Ahmed are a very solid center."
The Night Of,1,"his gritty HBO mini-series from June, based on a 2008 British series, ""Criminal Justice,"" confidently takes its time developing its characters."
The Night Of,1,"There's a good chance by the time September gets here, you'll be referring to ""the night of"" your massive The Night Of binge session."
The Night Of,0,"Everyone else, whether in jail, court, or the police station, is a variation on a character portrayed more distinctively in other TV shows."
The Night Of,1,"As well as busting the myth that you shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition, it's also an intelligent, completely gripping crime drama."
The Night Of,1,"Here the identity of the killer matters less than the dehumanising treatment of one presumed innocent until proven guilty, as The Night Of shows a young man ruined, perhaps forever, by the judicial structure designed to protect him."
The Night Of,1,... an enveloping and addictive story... [Full review in Spanish]
The Night Of,1,The Night Of is haunting.
The Night Of,1,Zaillian and Price's series paints a disturbing picture of the criminal justice system-and how its intrinsic financial and psychological pressures tear away at one's soul.
The Night Of,0,"Its opening credits are every bit as beautiful and gritty and pretentious as, say, True Detective's, but its story is simpler and far, far worse."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is a solid, hard-boiled story of individuals and institutions - the newest branch of a very specific family tree."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is a classic slow-burn murder mystery. It's also one of the rare shows in this era of binge-watch TV that is best consumed in a week-to-week format, rather than in one sitting."
The Night Of,1,This isn't about a miscarriage of justice-the prosecution is presented with as much respect and dignity as the defense-but about how the slow gears of justice grind up those caught in its wheels.
The Night Of,1,"Once its skin is peeled back, the series serves as a scathing assessment of the criminal justice system."
The Night Of,1,"If I had to cite one reason to keep tuning in, it's John Turturro."
The Night Of,1,"The chaotic courtrooms, the lawless prisons, the overworked public servants are all victims of corrupt organisations. This isn't TV. This isn't HBO. The Night Of is the real deal."
The Night Of,1,One thing I do know: I'm hooked.
The Night Of,1,This is Turturro at the top of his game.
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is certainly HBO's most electrifying series since the original True Detective, and one of the biggest and most intricate."
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
The Night Of,1,"Somber detective story is weighty, mature."
The Night Of,1,I'll take it over Game of Thrones any day.
The Night Of,1,"A moving human drama that also illustrates the price paid by families of the accused, who are mostly poor and non-white."
The Night Of,1,"The real New York kick comes from [Richard] Price's ability to thread his research with strands of black, barkingly funny cynicism."
The Night Of,1,"Drawing influences from The Wire, this HBO show boldly tackles race in the face of the criminal justice system."
The Night Of,1,"That's the brilliance of The Night Of; not that it invites us inside a jail cell, but that it dares us to lock the door."
The Night Of,1,The miniseries unfolds in leisurely fashion -- maybe too leisurely for some viewers. But it's hard not to admire how carefully observed and precisely rendered the scenes are. The level of detail is extraordinary.
The Night Of,1,"As Stone, Turturro refracts shades of gruffness, disenchantment, tenderness, exhaustion, and idealism not just scene by scene, but moment by moment."
The Night Of,1,"From the start, it's a murder mystery, but one that raises questions beyond whodunit, including: Can anyone, once accused, ever be presumed innocent?"
The Night Of,1,"Having chosen pragmatism over self-pity, The Night Of becomes something new: An anti-antihero drama. Like found-object art or high camp, it is deceptively ambitious in its ability to dance so closely to the edge of derivation."
The Night Of,1,"It feels, at times, like not much is happening as The Night Of unfolds, but every scene is weighted with meaning and the performances are stellar from top to bottom."
The Night Of,1,"Despite its lengthy gestation period, The Night Of arrives at the perfect time. In the wake of Netflix's Making A Murderer and NPR's Serial podcast, this series is the next immersive true crime experience to obsess and theorise over."
The Night Of,1,"It has all the hallmarks of a classic Law & Order-style police procedural, but because it takes the tropes of cop shows and runs them under a magnifying glass, examining them with excruciating precision, it feels exciting and different."
The Night Of,1,The Night Of's premiere suggests a mystery story unafraid of contrivance and coincidence.
The Night Of,1,A riveting mystery and a penetrating examination of how the criminal justice system dehumanizes its travelers; it's made all the richer by an embarrassment of precisely-drawn character studies.
The Night Of,1,"It's brutal and brilliant, perhaps the best new TV series you'll see this summer."
The Night Of,1,"It is a workman-like whodunit (or, more apt, a did-he-really-do-it?) and a somber meditation on the hellishness of the slow-grinding bureaucracy of the criminal justice system."
The Night Of,1,"Turturro may be the most recognizable face in the ensemble, but he's not the whole show. Without Riz Ahmed's riveting performance as accused murderer Nasir ""Naz"" Khan, the opening episode could have been pedestrian, even barely watchable at times."
The Night Of,1,"Deliberately paced but never dull, The Night Of offers a serialized criminal story that's more interested in the characters and the criminal justice system's process than in the crime itself."
The Night Of,1,"HBO's superb limited series doesn't break new ground so much as it showcases a group of actors, writers and directors working at an exceptionally high level, merging potentially familiar genres into a thoroughly absorbing mystery and character study."
The Night Of,1,"HBO's next great drama has arrived; The Night Of is a relentlessly dark and devastating look at the U.S. criminal justice system that feels eerily tailored to our consummately conflicted, painfully divided times."
The Night Of,1,The Night Of doesn't sugarcoat the biases and racism in a show bluntly depicting a murder investigation and trial.
The Night Of,1,"Forgive the misdemeanors and focus on the knowing minutiae and stellar performances, both of which are enough to make ""Night"" another must-see program."
The Night Of,1,"Familiarity doesn't make The Night Of any less involving, though, in large part because of Ahmed's charismatic and sympathetic performance as Naz."
The Night Of,1,"The summer's still young, but in terms of prestige series, it's going to be difficult to top this."
The Night Of,1,"HBO's new limited dramatic crime series ""The Night Of"" will keep you on edge."
The Night Of,1,"Find a good story, cast good actors, and make sure it looks like a million bucks. Then get out of the way and let the audience do the rest."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is compulsively watchable and extraordinarily rewarding, a brilliant and addictive mystery that inspires the viewer to go back and watch the same scenes again, looking for subtler character beats and hidden clues."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is a dazzling crime drama, sometimes breathtaking in its skill."
The Night Of,1,"Unfolding over eight episodes, it hits the dramatic jackpot on so many levels that no one who sees it will react in exactly the same way -- but most everyone will be forever changed by the experience."
The Night Of,1,"A gripping collision of race, religion, justice, incarceration and violence wrapped into a modern-day murder mystery, The Night Of may be the best limited series HBO has pulled off since the first season of True Detective."
The Night Of,1,"This is HBO's best ""limited series"" since Angels in America, which in 2004 won all of the major Emmy awards in its category."
The Night Of,1,This eight-part limited series is as good as TV crime drama gets.
The Night Of,1,"It is Agatha Christie meets The Wire, and it's one of the best things on TV in an already-great year."
The Night Of,1,"As Naz is told early on, ""we're way past the truth."" The idea that it doesn't matter is the show's most damning judgement of the judicial system."
The Night Of,1,The richness of the story owes much to the extraordinary attention to detail paid by Price and Zaillian in creating even the supporting characters.
The Night Of,1,The must-watch series of the summer.
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of never seems less than completely authentic. There's a real feel here for the way we talk, jostle and interact - a familiarity that bolsters a story designed to keep you off balance."
The Night Of,1,"The Night of... becomes something sharp, wise, and thoroughly compelling. It's a mini-series that's vast and omniscient in scope, but also intimately detailed, a piece of granular, fictionalized sociology that tells a grand and scary story."
The Night Of,1,"The series excels at laying out the snowballing costs of a case, financial and psychological."
The Night Of,1,"An eye-opening, heart-aching drama, as solemn and devastating as an unanswered prayer."
The Night Of,1,"The triumph of The Night Of is showing us the ways in which incarceration changes a person, changes that will likely continue once he's freed into a world of very few prospects."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of is a compelling mystery, and I suspect that if the show becomes as popular as it deserves to be, much of the audience will be fixated on solving it."
The Night Of,1,"The Night Of, HBO's new eight-part limited series... is a remarkable piece of work, restoring meaning to overused adjectives such as ""gripping"" and ""powerful."""
The Night Of,1,"While the theme of The Night Of is a big downer, it arrives in a big, happy package for viewers: weeks of pleasure, watching excellent performers reciting rich, vivid dialogue, filmed with the luxurious skill of an elaborate theatrical movie."
The Night Of,1,The Night Of produces endless richness and sobering meanings about the degrading cost of a flawed justice system.
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
The Night Of,1,Everything that HBO has wanted out of a drama since True Detective sparked then fizzled is available in spades in The Night Of.
The Night Of,1,Riz Ahmed's Naz navigates an extreme incarnation of a tightrope that those with immigrant heritage must walk.
The Night Of,0,"This drawn-out, plodding miniseries stretches every one of its meager strengths beyond its breaking point."
The Night Of,1,Great care has been taken in almost every aspect of bringing the former Gandolfini passion project to TV.
The Night Of,1,It's enthralling. The Night Of looks like this summer's TV obsession.
The Night Of,1,The Night Of shrewdly demonstrates how our desire for a good story can blind us to the truth.
The Night Of,1,"It's vital and gripping. It's not an imitator dressing itself up in the trappings of a classic HBO drama, but the real deal."
The Night Of,1,Both its plot and realistic atmosphere are nothing short of absorbing and it'll very likely be a sympathy gift from HBO to those that were disappointed by the second and likely final season of True Detective.
The Night Of,1,Zaillian's presentation is extremely detailed with precise language that feels relaxed and authentic. In such meticulous craftsmanship lies an implication of relevance to come.
The Night Of,1,"The net effect is hypnotic, like reading a fat crime novel filled with memorable characters and atmospheric details."
South Park,1,"Hearts have been broken and lives ruined in the quest to do whats achieved here so easily: A funny story, well told."
South Park,1,"Frustratingly, though, [it] lacks a clear point of view...still, there’s humor to be found..."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"The new season launches Lila and Lenù into adulthood, navigating the conditions of work, marriage, and family in a society undergoing radical change."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"There have been some excellent series lately. And then theres been My Brilliant Friend.
Based on the Elena Ferrante Neopolitan novels, this is a glorious piece of profound, searing beauty."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"My Brilliant Friend continues to transport with its gorgeous cinematography and set design, and to challenge with its realism and honesty."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"When Lila stands in that apartment in her old neighbourhood, I felt that for the first time in quite some time, there was a bit of hope in her eyesthat there was still something bright she could build out of the ashes life had given her."
My Brilliant Friend,1,I hand it to series three of the TV adaptation with knobs on.
My Brilliant Friend,1,Sublime television.
My Brilliant Friend,1,"For those who luxuriated in its first two seasons, it remains as gorgeous and seductive as ever."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"This isn’t a series about girls escaping into womanhood, but women shackled to their origins. That Lila and Lenù look as they did at 16 only reinforces the dark thesis that, for women who grew up poor in post-War Italy, reinvention is impossible."
My Brilliant Friend,1,“My Brilliant Friend” is a series of rare sweep and extraordinary accomplishment.
My Brilliant Friend,1,The break in production because of the pandemic allowed this adaptation of Elena Ferrante's Those Who Leave And Those To Stay to feel even more authentic.
My Brilliant Friend,1,"It was worth the wait, but it arrives with a caveat: there are many moving parts here, both via characters and story arcs."
My Brilliant Friend,1,"The main reason to love My Brilliant Friend is that it contains one of the most honest, unsentimental depictions of friendship—female or otherwise—in either literature or television."
Lovecraft Country,1,"For the first episode Lovecraft Country, showrunner and head writer Misha Green has done a stellar job of introducing viewers to the characters and this world of monsters and men."
Lovecraft Country,1,HBO's series feels like nothing you expect -- and nothing you've ever seen before.
Lovecraft Country,1,A resplendent fantasy horror gets tangled up in its own weirdness...
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is a concerted attempt to subvert, invert and 'colorize' the Lovecraft canon."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Generally, television shows are better served by declining to handhold their audiences through various twists and turns. But Lovecraft moves straight past 'trust the audience' and runs right into 'the audience can read our minds.'"
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country wears its progressivism like a costume.
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country is ultimately a collection of smart and relevant ideas scattered across a collection of strange episodes.
Lovecraft Country,1,"There is no doubt Lovecraft Country is a thoroughly enjoyable, pulpy romp... There are flaws but the conviction and energy in Green's vision shines through."
Lovecraft Country,1,"While it stumbles now and then, Lovecraft Country stands out from the TV pack"
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country does a lot of powerful work that's wonderfully informed by genre filmmaking, making for an entertaining series of episodes."
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country is a perfect case study for what can be achieved when one embraces the endless possibilities that comes with diversity.
Lovecraft Country,1,The two leads have great chemistry which serves them well as they navigate the plot.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is, frankly, a complete hot mess, but I mean that in the kindest possible terms."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It has been one helluva performance from Majors, who combined statuesque physicality with an affectingly expressive face. He added heft to what could have tipped into cartoonish fantasy."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than weaving the elements of the show together to buttress each other, Lovecraft Country simply piles up a bunch of horror tropes for no discernible reason."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Despite its gorgeous set pieces and sometimes fantastical events, the series is rooted firmly in convincing characters and plausible relationships."
Lovecraft Country,1,"This show is wild and crazy, but watching the Black version of an Indiana Jones tale or a haunted house where the spirits show up for the Black characters is thrilling."
Lovecraft Country,1,"What makes Lovecraft Country so powerful is not simply its examination of racism through a supernatural lens --rather, the power in its subversion of cosmic horror lies in its challenge of H.P. Lovecraft himself."
Lovecraft Country,1,"On the one hand, it's a cracking good adventure story, and on the other it's a searing portrait of racial injustice in America."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Not as robust as it could be, Lovecraft Country has some strong performances and strikes a unique balance between actual and metaphorical monsters. Is it worth your time? Absolutely."
Lovecraft Country,1,"While Lovecraft Country does not entirely deliver on its promises, it's too unique to be entirely abandoned."
Lovecraft Country,1,"I can see this being a big hit thanks to its crowd-pleasing blood and gore, and Smollett-Bell's charismatic turn. I just hope it leaves the wizardry to Harry Potter next time around."
Lovecraft Country,1,"I have no idea where Lovecraft Country is going, but I'm very much enjoying its rewiring of American genre fiction and pop culture."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Episodes that play specifically with form are quite strong, and the acting throughout is exceptional. The production design, art direction, and cinematography are beautiful and thoughtful."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is confronting and visceral because it has to be, not because it should be -- it wants you to feel it in your bones because there's nothing easygoing or copacetic about the story it's telling."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Considering the track record of all involved, they seem to have had unfettered freedom, and that license is a sword that cuts both ways. But when it works, it works brilliantly."
Lovecraft Country,1,"While at times the effects are laughable and the sequences corny, the strong cast sells what is happening well enough to look past these occasional downfalls. Smollett and Majors, in particular, shine in every scene."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Remarkably, Green and her team of directors are able to keep the creep factor going. They introduce plenty of sketchy humans, then give them terrifying views that serve as more than metaphors."
Lovecraft Country,1,"For every fun, if wildly anachronistic, element, Lovecraft Country is always careful to re-center itself on its characters, and their hemmed-in status as Black women and men in 1950s America."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is a new and highly ambitious kind of horror, blending history, pop culture and polemic. But it works, primarily, because it respects the conventions of old-school horror."
Lovecraft Country,0,The problem isn't that Lovecraft Country doesn't meet the expectation of a Lovecraft fan; the problem is that it uses Lovecraft tropes superficially and doesn't exploit their strengths.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green has a thorough understanding of horror tropes, including pace and point of view, guaranteeing plenty of leap-in-your-seat scares. But, in the end, it's the horror of the racism that Atticus and his party encounter that's truly chilling."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's like nothing else. Uncompromising, brutal and righteously furious. I'm fascinated to see where it goes."
Lovecraft Country,1,"In so many ways, Lovecraft Country is TV that's come just at the right time."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Creator Misha Green has tapped into a hungry modern audience craving diverse representation on screen, stirring a macabre cauldron of lush period visuals, anachronistic music and racial themes served with delicious schlock on a weekly basis."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lush with lore and spilling with subtext, Lovecraft Country has the rare ability to be deadly serious yet hugely entertaining at the same time"
Lovecraft Country,0,"A by-the-numbers story that wants to be bold and daring, and in so doing ends up not engaging with its own strongest elements."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Right now, between the messy narrative, bendable rules, and buckets of blood, it's just too hard to get a grip on ""Lovecraft Country."""
Lovecraft Country,1,"In Lovecraft Country, Smollett is even more physical than she was when she was a superhero. And as is the case for Charlize Thereon, there's something about the 50s clothes and makeup that suits Smollett exceptionally well."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country has the expansive storytelling, varied settings, and showy camerawork that people commonly call cinematic."
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country melds the macabre monster stories of H. P. Lovecraft with the real-life horror of Jim Crow America.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Oh, this is good."
Lovecraft Country,1,"With a stellar cast and exceptional writing, Lovecraft Country intends to provide us layer after layer of thoughts and images for us to chew on."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Tremendously creative and hugely gripping, Lovecraft Country is astounding genre-defying television."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Each character, each story, each line serves a purpose that helps to build a world of mystery, magic and Lovecraftian lore."
Lovecraft Country,1,Mature horror series has both mythical and human monsters.
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country links to literary racism simply for fake topicality. Anti-American nihilism and hopeless racial cynicism give the show its gotcha.
Lovecraft Country,0,"The new HBO series isn't interested in torquing the qualities of what's called Lovecraftian, nor inheriting them-and its episodes are weighted down by historical annotations and clumsy exposition."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The very concept itself is more terrifying than anything that plays on screen, but the episode is visceral, exciting and polished, and the three leads display an easygoing and inviting chemistry."
Lovecraft Country,1,Me? Liking a sci-fi show? In this economy?
Lovecraft Country,1,"I have never seen something that manages to be from the outset immediately paranormal, then so realistic at portraying [the 1950s] in a very short space of time."
Lovecraft Country,1,The bold mix of horror styles in an episodic format makes this a trip you will want to tag along for.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country has an extraordinary ability to wink and keep a straight face at the same time, to be fun and serious simultaneously."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Some of it is funny and even satiric, yet it tells a story about racism and prejudice and, because of all that has been learned from BLM, it's both right now and of another time."
Lovecraft Country,1,Misha Green was not responding to George Floyd when she wrote this episode-she was responding to the history of police violence visited upon people whose skin has been kissed by the sun. The only thing that's new is the mythical beings who save them.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country's aims are straightforward, and maybe they're enough."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country is within its rights to use people as a vehicle for a story, rather than vice versa-but the story has to be considered and focused enough to be worth the trade-off."
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's a chilling, often terrifying, series that's so good you'll want to binge-watch every episode and then start again."
Lovecraft Country,1,"[Misha Geen] is the one who manages to sell this potent, but potentially hokey premise, cleverly leaving the viewer unsure as to whether what they are witnessing is simply a figment of Atticus' imagination."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's helpful to think of [t], then, as akin to a game of Jenga: Its aim isn't to collapse the house that genre built, but rather to slide a new layer of storytelling on top of century-old bones to find out if the entire structure can still hold."
Lovecraft Country,1,"There are no scene stealers in Lovecraft Country (Smollett comes close a few times), which in this case is a compliment. Grandstanding has no place in a show as complex as this one, since merely understanding the plot requires careful concentration."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The rules of the world Green has created remain confounding. Still, there's enough reason to watch, but patience will be necessary to see where it all will ultimately lead."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Jonathan Majors is phenomenal as the brooding Tic, backed effectively by Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Letitia and Courtney B Vance as George."
Lovecraft Country,1,Showrunner Misha Green knows how to find the joy in the moment - or in the pages of a good pulp novel - without denying the historical context.
Lovecraft Country,1,A fun and ambitious freak show that explores all kinds of horrors. [Full Review in Spanish]
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country puts a supernatural spin on some very real American horrors.
Lovecraft Country,1,To say that Lovecraft Country is a whole lot of show would be an understatement.
Lovecraft Country,1,"The screen-popping show blends racial drama with gory horror, taking on a style that's ever-changing but always watchable."
Lovecraft Country,1,"...saturated with a realer, more urgent anxiety. It is paralyzing, infuriating, and great. I had an honest-to-god nightmare that night..."
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country is a chaotic rebuke of American racism.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Mesmerizing world-building and certain powerful moments make this series irresistible... Not every episode works, but the good heavily outweighs the mediocre."
Lovecraft Country,1,The performances are top-notch.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green's gift is in centering Black characters in blockbuster-style epics... Here she seizes the opportunity to play around with an array of cinematic genres and tell many stories within the course of a single, season-long quest."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than be precise in its refutation of the legacy of Lovecraft, Lovecraft Country only takes the broadest possible swipes at the monster of racism, leaving the show feeling oddly one-note and shallow."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The largely spellbinding Lovecraft Country will find its base among nostalgic, literary, socially conscious sci-fi devotees as well as special-effects buffs."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Lovecraft Country,1,H.P. would hate this show with every fiber of his being. It's pleasing to imagine the horror of that old racist as a bunch of talented Black artists wreak bloody vengeance on his monstrosities.
Lovecraft Country,1,"...a likable cast of leads, an easy to buy into premise, sharp cultural commentary, and the promise of truly nutty monster shenanigans."
Lovecraft Country,1,A work of radical pop exuberance from Misha Green.
Lovecraft Country,1,"As a standalone tonight, though, it can't be beat."
Lovecraft Country,1,This cast is really strong you have so many talented players in this show.
Lovecraft Country,1,The open racism of Jim Crow America is on full display in nearly every scene.
Lovecraft Country,1,"HBO's latest genre series, showcasing that often times it's not the literal monsters to be most afraid of. It expresses that premise well, but it might be trying to do too much at once."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Including elements of the genres that are often unkind to their Black characters, 'Lovecraft Country' does a stellar job at ridding us of the awful tropes and exploring racism, history, and monsters real and sci-fi alike."
Lovecraft Country,1,This could not have come at a better time...
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's cool that they're making genre stuff that is touching on things like racism, police brutality..."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Pulp horror stories are best consumed in a single, quick encounter, before their limitations of plot and characterization become too obvious to ignore. Lovecraft Country is reduced to one of the walking dead long before its final credits roll."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The leads are terrific and the special effects are extremely high quality for television, but you have to be able to roll with the over-the-top scare-fest that is at the center of the plot to enjoy it."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The show inadvertently simplifies the realities of white supremacy with its monster allegory, while treating the Black cast less as characters in their own right and more as vehicles for a sweeping critique of American racism."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is lurid, vivid, uneven and a fascinating mix of genres and subplots worthy of The Twilight Zone."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is so full of layers, homages, and Easter eggs, along with handling issues that apply to the current climate so well. It's a welcome addition to the TV landscape."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The HBO series conjures a pretty intoxicating atmosphere, while proving confounding about what its rules are. The result is well worth watching, but requires patience to see where this gothic road will ultimately lead."
Lovecraft Country,1,"To call ""Lovecraft Country"" ""wildly original"" seems almost a quaint understatement. But it is wild. And original. Little doubt about that."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Fear not, or tremble, because we now have the thrillingly brilliant Lovecraft Country...consider [that] a forewarning and a promise of shocking and twisted entertainment with a warm wet beating heart."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The first episode of Lovecraft Country is brilliant - you don't get better storytelling. But afterwards it becomes a very different show, so we'll see how audiences react."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It may be mad and chaotic and it teeters on the edge of preposterous, but this is a thoroughly exhilarating hell-ride through the nightmare of the black experience of traveling and living in 1950s America, seen through the prism of sci-fi horror."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The series shows the monstrous evil of racism that echoes today while at the same time introducing woods full of literal monsters as a metaphor for racism. Lovecraft Country also manages to be an entertaining, gory thrill ride."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The creativity on display is phenomenal, with writing that's layered with meanings and allusions, acting that brings the kind of emotional grounding you don't always find in genre stories, and visual realizations that are stunning."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The energy and freedom of pulp serves as both our way into the story and as a means for the Black characters to create an alternate, improved mythology for themselves."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is a knockout of a show and one that is epic, terrifying, and relevant altogether. If the rest of the five episodes can maintain what the first half has established, there's no question that this can be HBO's best show of the year."
Lovecraft Country,1,"With each new episode, we gain more appreciation of the thought that's been put into every aspect of Lovecraft Country's production, including the cultural baggage that accompanies each reference - Lovecraft more than any other."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's an astounding piece of television, but I think I'm going to stick with my initial reaction: Lovecraft Country is ""batsh*t insane,"" but in the greatest way."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's all dazzling, if sometimes disorienting. After five episodes, it's hard to know where ""Lovecraft Country"" is going. But even if it careens off the rails, the show has so much creativity and passion it's a ride worth taking."
Lovecraft Country,1,"One profound, terrifyingly fun, and riveting character-driven horror series that will have H.P. Lovecraft spinning in his grave."
Lovecraft Country,1,Lovecraft Country feels like an important step on the long road to on-screen representation. This is a picture of what America truly is - monsters and all - and it's time to stop turning away.
Lovecraft Country,1,"Nina Simone rings and For Colored Girls shouts, this is the work of art that is Lovecraft Country."
Lovecraft Country,1,"A show that uses genre storytelling to peel back layers of American history to reveal the systemic problems underneath it, but it's also got a marvelously entertaining side, one that's gory and sexy in unexpected ways."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's the best of both worlds; horror taken seriously and approached with intelligence, but without forgoing the fun supernatural elements and man-eating creatures that keep us gleefully hooked."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's enjoyable, in a ridiculous way; it's so heightened that it delivers a roller-coaster experience, which is sometimes all you want from a show."
Lovecraft Country,1,"""Lovecraft"" is overflowing with atmosphere: Its visuals are wrought in vivid colors and scored to kicky modern music (from Cardi B to Rihanna to ""The Jeffersons"" theme song)."
Lovecraft Country,1,"""Lovecraft Country"" certainly isn't without its flaws. But it's now timelier than its creators mayhave imagined. And it'll make you think, which may be the best thing about it."
Lovecraft Country,1,A ferociously compelling watch.
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's uneven and unsubtle, but it is also a dynamic adventure and a bracing depiction of the power of black culture, past and present."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green has created a unique, immersive world with seemingly endless possibilities to explore."
Lovecraft Country,1,"A pulpy, smart, and compelling series, ""Lovecraft Country"" expertly tackles race issues while incorporating slick special effects, folklore, and stellar performances. It's all you'll be talking for the rest of the summer. The best show of 2020 so far."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Within the first five episodes, you do get to see parts where they just knock it out of the park."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Each episode takes a breath away and surprises the audience with a new element of action, another excellent character, or a plot twist that has the viewer at the edge of their seat. Lovecraft Country is extraordinary."
Lovecraft Country,1,"The series features terrific actors, led by Jurnee Smollett and Jonathan Majors, going for broke but full of subtlety when the emotional terrain demands it."
Lovecraft Country,1,"As much as Lovecraft Country's advertising plays up the potential for romance between its two leads, Smollett and Majors' performances expertly steer clear of any sort of hero/damsel dynamic in favor of something almost competitive."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country won't be for everyone. It can be slow-moving and the nefarious cultists are generally a bland bunch... Still, there is lots of pulpy fun and some gory moments (the easily-spooked should avoid)."
Lovecraft Country,1,"What works best is the immense symbolic power, drawn from Lovecraft as well as from Green's imagination."
Lovecraft Country,1,"While Lovecraft Country's plot moves fast, fast, fast-with head-spinningly quick consequences seemingly abandoned, only to manifest as high concept plots themselves-there's so much good to hold onto that its pages turn themselves."
Lovecraft Country,1,Emptying out a library's worth of pulp references and using them to spelunk the darkness of postwar American white supremacy just before the dawn of the civil rights era makes for a heady brew. But the ideas don't always play out successfully.
Lovecraft Country,1,"I liked Atticus, George, Montrose and the rest of the Freemans. They are relentlessly bookish. Their reading habits come in handy on many occasions."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Elements of comic horror, a dark atmosphere and supernatural scenes create a pulp aesthetic that directly references the works of (white supremacist) HP Lovecraft while addressing real social issues."
Lovecraft Country,1,"It's to everybody else's credit that Smollett doesn't knock them off the screen entirely, but Majors is a steady, slow-burning leading man and Vance and Williams add embraceable decency and fiery torment respectively."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Smollett is especially good at taking a heroic stance. She is the character you most don't want to mess with, though it's Wunmi Mosaku, as her economically frustrated sister Ruby, who makes the greater impression, in a transmogrification storyline."
Lovecraft Country,1,What helps to keep all the chaos controlled-aside from standout performances from Majors and Smollett-Bell-is a vibrant soundtrack that is nothing less than scintillating.
Lovecraft Country,1,"From top to the bottom, Lovecraft Country has an absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast, but special praise has to go to leads Jonathan Majors and Jurnee Smollett-Bell."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green's most rewarding [changes] come in the form of the extra time she devotes to tracking the emotional fallout of the characters' experiences, not only in relation to the horrors they witness, but the everyday degradations they suffer."
Lovecraft Country,1,"""Lovecraft Country"" is dizzying; poetic; and terrifying."
Lovecraft Country,1,Horrors Both Human and Otherworldly Haunt Misha Green's Spellbinding Series
Lovecraft Country,1,"Just four years since Ruff's novel yet Lovecraft highlights the kind of historical research, visual world-building, and characterization of at least a decade in the making. Remarkable."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is one of my favorite shows of the year so far. It is scary, thrilling, and sexy as hell while still saying something relevant about race in the United States both historically and currently."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country lands in a specific time and place for both, but in a way that feels universal as much as it feels scary. It's one of the best shows HBO has made in a long, long time."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Lovecraft Country is brilliant just based upon premise and promise alone, and it delivers on this mashup of horror & sci-fi with racism. But despite the monsters that loom large over everything...it's very true that white supremacy is the biggest terror."
Lovecraft Country,1,"Green's smoldering vision gives way to powerful multi-layered and dimensional performances, and she does not shy away from uncomfortable topics."
Lovecraft Country,1,"A love letter to the pulp fiction that H.P. Lovecraft wrote: fun, ferocious, and full of dread."
Lovecraft Country,1,"With Lovecraft Country, HBO has found its next Watchmen, mixing high production and social commentary with pulpy genre tropes. It hits with the kind of twists and spectacle that will definitely keep social media buzzing."
Lovecraft Country,1,"[Lovecraft Country] is a dark and mysterious journey in 1950s Jim Crow America that's disturbing, spine-chilling and out of this world."
Love Life,1,"Watching someone in their 30s work out how to become the person they want to be, and the right person to help them on their way to that, makes for a different series than the first, but one that is just as effective."
Love Life,1,Jackson Harper brims with both starlike charisma and a naturalness that makes the character seem completely relatable and recognisable. In him the show has found an absolute catch.
Love Life,1,"Makeups and breakups, hookups, bad judgment, and selfish behavior, are all part of the characters journey to emotional maturity and a healthy relationship, which at the risk of spoiling things, were happy to say he gets."
Love Life,1,"For all its sexy trappings, Love Life reveals itself to be achingly sweet."
Love Life,1,"I started watching the new season last week and, the more I watched, the more I got reeled [in]."
Love Life,1,"Marcus doesn't always get it right, but this season of Love Life is sharp, funny and insightful, and Harper gives a terrific performance."
Love Life,1,"William Jackson Harper carries the series into richer terrain, exploring universal themes of seeking love mingled with the Black American experience."
Love Life,1,"The series once again makes the journey from first love to last love an entertainingly relatable watch, as we're reminded that 'happily ever after' often comes in very different forms these days."
Love Life,1,"The second season is a great improvement on the first, and I think it has a broader audience potential."
Love Life,1,"It's a smart showcase for a talented actor who seizes it with both hands, giving the rom-com genre a jolt as welcome as it is overdue."
Love Life,1,"Love Life returns for a new season, different characters and a different story, and it is formidably good and engaging."
Love Life,1,"Love Life's second season surpasses the first just by shifting the focus away from a subject we've seen so many times to one that has a messier, and more interesting, story."
Love Life,1,Marcus' situation takes a while to smooth out in the way that all rom-com adventures do. But the wonderful writing and a superb cast makes riding out the rough chop of modern romance at his side an absolute pleasure.
Love Life,1,"It's more of an open dialogue largely granted by the fact that many of the main characters are people of color, for whom these topics are apt and genuinely difficult to navigate."
Love Life,1,"Punkie Johnson is a particular standout as Marcus' lady-killer sister Ida, while her SNL castmate Ego Nwodim brings nuance and empathy to Ola... who might have otherwise come off as a caricature."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
Love Life,1,"Love Life finally makes space for Black people and queerness in a way that Season 1 didn't dare - and it is here, with just a modicum of faith in its audience, that the show creates something worthwhile."
Love Life,1,Harper's on-screen charisma and that of his co-stars is ultimately what keeps this season afloat.
Love Life,1,"Love Life works according to that design while also acknowledging that getting to that happy ending involves challenge, struggle, and unexpected snags. It excels in a genre that can often detour into fantasy by staying grounded in reality."
Love Life,1,"The writing remains Love Life's biggest draw, and Marcus' world feels richly constructed around him, perhaps more so than in Darby's story."
Young Justice,1,"Deception has made characters like Nightwing, Miss Martian, Aqualad, and Superboy as seasoned as the Justice League was when the show began, and it can be heartbreaking to see them deal with regret."
Young Justice,1,"Bringing the focus back to the core cast helps really show how much the characters have grown over time, even as the new season adds significant details to the show's already complex world"
Landscapers,1,"There are sordid moments, yet the series never falls in commonplace sensationalism. [Full review in Spanish]"
Landscapers,1,"""An interesting deconstruction of the true-crime formula"". [Full Review in Spanish]. -Letras Libres-"
Landscapers,1,"Instead of a whodunnit, Landscapers instead is a pleasurable exercise in style."
Landscapers,1,"Though this theatrical style has the effect of making a few of Colman and Thewlis' lines and delivery feel extremely staged, the two lead actors are nothing short of phenomenal in what could have been two very boring roles."
Landscapers,1,"Truly, Landscapers is a dark delight."
Landscapers,1,"Thanks to Colman and Thewlis' magnificent work, the series manages to break the rules of the genre and pay homage to it at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]"
Landscapers,1,Probably the least surprising feature of the series is just how good Colman and Thewlis are as the codependent couple.
Landscapers,1,"Director Will Sharpe shows sets being decommissioned, while the characters lie to themselves so they can continue to believe what they need to. Tragedy has almost a tenderness in these scenes."
Landscapers,1,Olivia Colman and David Thewlis give stellar performances in this true crime retelling that offers an empathetic perspective of a couple whose grasp on reality is questionable.
Landscapers,1,Scores points thanks to its positioning as an atypical and picturesque true crime. [Full review in Spanish]
Landscapers,1,"HBO's four-episode event series concluded Monday night, one of the most romantic and unusual crime series we've ever seen."
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers arms itself with trippy, dream-like reconstructions and quirky, theatrical breakdowns of real-life events."
Landscapers,1,"A true-crime dramatisation that is so inventive, its inventiveness becomes key, perhaps at the expense of the actual story."
Landscapers,1,A compelling miniseries. [Full review in Spanish]
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers is a visually ambitious, if thinly sketched true crime story."
Landscapers,1,"There's a devastating tension to Thewlis's seamless switching between the mild-mannered, attenuated husband and the Gary Cooper surrogate of Susan's dreams. The"
Landscapers,1,Oscar and Emmy winner Olivia Colman continues to astonish with her emotional range in a peak performance of deep pathos as the childlike and chipper Susan.
Landscapers,1,I fell on it like a parched dog.
Landscapers,0,"Every bit of this story is as weird as hell. The trouble is that, on screen, weirdness itself doesn't really give you very far to go."
Landscapers,1,"The series gets more involving as it goes on, but you have to ask whether this post-modern jokiness is suitable for brutal real-life murders committed not very long ago."
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers not only benefits from great performances by Colman and Thewlis, but it's a dark comedy that's actually howlingly funny in between all of the darkness. That balance is very difficult to achieve."
Landscapers,1,"If Sinclair's bold concept and script lift it well above the average crime drama, the direction, by Will Sharpe, is what makes Landscapers unforgettable."
Landscapers,1,Landscapers is another Peak TV example of sharp directing combined with awards-worthy performances.
Landscapers,1,"For viewers without the patience for a more artistic approach to the true crime genre, Landscapers is unlikely to be their cup of tea. However, the premiere leaves plenty of questions to be answered if you're looking to see the mystery out until its end."
Landscapers,1,"As a viewer, I very much enjoyed it, but if I was related to Patricia and William Wycherley, I would be furious."
Landscapers,1,"It is a rich, generous, clever, multi-textured thing, immaculately played by all the main actors, but awards for Colman, Thewlis and the script must surely be given."
Landscapers,1,"The actors cut through the clutter, even if ""Landscapers"" can't quite pull off its intended swings from ironic-comic referencing to Susan's anguished revelations of her childhood."
Landscapers,1,"""Landscapers"" has much to recommend it, not only for its writing and directing but for the subtle shading Colman and Thewlis lend to Susan and Chris..."
Landscapers,1,"The result is rich, thought-provoking art that makes Susan and Christopher strangely sympathetic, as they blend the lines of fantasy in order to keep the truth -- whatever it might be -- deeply buried."
Landscapers,1,"A miniseries which offers a wonderfully inventive look at a bizarre case, with top-notch acting and direction."
Landscapers,1,"Sharpe's direction is clever and strong and the leads' performances are well-crafted; Landscapers""is worth sampling."
Landscapers,1,"It's still an interesting detour into bizarre true crime, but so stylized as to blunt the overall impact by being too cute for its own good."
Landscapers,1,"To achieve the required impact of the elaborate technique of storytelling used, which is itself a deconstruction of storytelling, takes enormous skill. Everyone involved here has that skill and the series is both disturbing and delectable."
Landscapers,1,"It's a style that won't appeal to everyone, and a bold approach for a story about a real double murder, but the terrific cast and Sharpe's direction keep it from distracting from what is a bizarre, brutal and poignant story about human behaviour."
Landscapers,1,I'd take this over another re-enactment of the Ted Bundy story any day.
Landscapers,1,"""Landscapers"" is a showcase for Thewlis, with his angular frame and his distinctive style of commanding awkwardness."
Landscapers,1,"Thewlis and Colman are amazing, whether they're quietly but passionately declaring their love for one another while under investigation or appearing as idealized versions of themselves in the fantasy sequences...."
Landscapers,1,"It's a haunting, melancholy story about two people who are devoted to each other above all else -- including the truth."
Landscapers,1,"In a gentle duet, the two actors create a richly strange coupling of loners, a pair of lost souls broken together. It's magical."
Landscapers,1,"It may be a little artsy for those seeking a straight-up mystery, but Colman and co-star David Thewlis are both terrific."
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers is uniquely appealing, horrifying - a masterwork."
Landscapers,1,"A more experimental and playful piece of work than a traditional true crime drama, centering two phenomenal performances in a project that almost deconstructs the concept of narrative as much as serve as an explainer for murderers."
Landscapers,1,"As much a love story between Susan and Chris as it is a true-crime caper, viewers expecting a straightforward tale may be baffled by what Landscapers delivers, which is sometimes interesting and different, other times overwrought and pretentious."
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers does well in illustrating the value that even the most despairing of us can find in stories, and in cinema, even if it only sometimes manages to find beauty lurking within this grim little tale."
Landscapers,1,"Landscapers is four episodes of intentionally disparate perspectives held together mostly by its two leads, who remarkably maintain consistency through this maelstrom of pastiche."
Landscapers,1,Landscapers so effectively portrays the Edwardses' world that we want to believe their (purported) lies as much as they do.
Landscapers,1,"""Landscapers"" dares to cast aside expectations and dares the viewer to come along for the ride. It is wonderfully in tune with film's capacity to make up its own truth."
Steven Universe,1,"Steven Universe is much more than a simple cartoon. It serves as text that highlights the importance of navigating positionalities and rejecting colonial projects, whether on Earth or in intergalactic empires."
Steven Universe,1,"It created memorable, deservedly beloved characters that I already miss. It raised the bar immensely for diversity, among both the cast and crew. The world of animation is irrevocably different because of Steven Universe, and for the better."
Steven Universe,1,"Feels very much like an epic swan song. It doesn't tie up a number of the series' dangling threads, but instead presents you with the bookend to a story that just feels... right."
Steven Universe,1,"For the first time in a while, there's no way to know what's going to happen on Steven Universe -- and it's thrilling."
Steven Universe,1,"Steven Universe's queerness isn't just about the show's superficial trappings, it's baked into a core message: fight for love against all odds."
Steven Universe,1,A big queer step forward for cartoon TV.
Steven Universe,1,Steven Universe is distinctive for its prominence of queerness and its relevance to narrative arcs. Queerness is not sidelined. It is at the forefront.
Steven Universe,1,"Steven Universe as a series has always been one that highlights characters acting outside usual gender roles. Steven, even though he's a boy, dresses up in more feminine clothing on occasion and openly discusses his feelings."
Steven Universe,1,"Few shows are as empathetic or committed to the value of all identities as this one, and it's fearless in its message of loving kindness even in the face of profound adversity. In this way, it's quietly one of the most radical shows in the medium."
Steven Universe,1,"It's packed with shattering (pardon my pun) revelations, some of the best action sequences Steven Universe has ever aired, and the series' typical love."
Steven Universe,1,"All these characters aren't just fighting for something, they're fighting for each others' right to live-and to find happiness. With so much hate thrown around in the world today, kids need these messages to teach them a more compassionate way."
Steven Universe,1,"Steven Universe is a beacon of purity, reminding us of who and what we could all be if we weren't so jaded. When I watch it, I smile."
Steven Universe,1,Steven Universe has pushed queer representation further than any other all-ages TV show ever dreamed of doing.
Steven Universe,1,"""The Question"" not only gave us one of the show's sweetest episodes, but also a major milestone in the series' championing of representation."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Gossip Girl,1,"Gossip Girl tried to sell escapism, and until the recession hit, it succeeded. But when the real world encroached upon its high-society fantasy, the show faced an impossible dilemma."
Gossip Girl,0,"A few good characters caught in a terrible TV show, desperately trying to escape."
Gossip Girl,1,"All in all, a strong start to the final chapter."
Gossip Girl,1,"The Girl is getting older, but there's still pleasure to be had on the final lap."
Girls,1,Even when Girls infuriated me it always moved me.
Girls,1,"The season is well thought out and gripping and gives the audience some of that ""personal growth"" we have been wanting from these characters."
Girls,1,"""American Bitch"" is the strongest and most thought-provoking episode."
Girls,1,"It's been witty and inventive, ugly and ridiculous. It juggles despair and dark humour with deceptive dexterity. It has moments that are breathtakingly confident."
Girls,1,"Hannah has managed to make her ""voice of a generation"" heard, just as her creator and interpreter has done it, a generation that is still lost but which, over the years, forces her to find her way, even if it is based on blows. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Girls,1,The one thing I really love about Girls is that it refuses to conform to identity politics.
Girls,1,A welcome catch-up with infuriating old friends who'll be gone all too soon.
Girls,1,"Through the messy arena that is life, love, and latching onto something real, Girls was only ever doing its best. And thank god for that."
Girls,0,"For a show that started off so real to its target demographic, it didn't end that way."
Girls,1,"The media spotlight may have moved on, but have the girls grown up?"
Girls,0,"Girls was insistently offbeat, and in defiance of TV convention, a character study more than an ensemble piece - even if it wasn't quite willing to admit that."
Girls,1,"Whatever else you may think about it, Lena Dunham's show has given many millennial women a mirror."
Girls,1,"It's going to be weird not having any more Girls to look forward to. But Hannah's always going to be around, probably in Brooklyn, in her apartment, dancing on her own."
Girls,1,"It took the entire six seasons, but Girls is going out as the one thing it ever wanted to be: a good TV show."
Girls,1,"That ""voice of a generation"" crack Dunham made in the pilot episode? Damn if it hasn't come true."
Girls,1,"If you're Girls, you don't give in to reflection and coasting on the loyalty of your audience. You keep running, you don't flinch and you don't slow down."
Girls,1,"Dunham et al should be proud that, with inevitable dips, they've made a well-crafted slice of popular culture that has neither flagged nor become a parody of itself."
Girls,1,"Not as strong as in the past, but you've come this far"
Girls,1,"Despite all the ink the series has gotten over the years, Girls is essentially a hipster soap opera - occasionally clever or smart - but not as revealing as it led you to believe."
Girls,1,"Where the show tends to work best in those single-character stories, Hannah's time in Montauk quickly feels repetitive, and the ensemble material's more compelling."
Girls,1,"It was, and remains, the story of privileged, self-absorbed New York twentysomethings told with a deadpan aesthetic more like indie cinema than classic US sitcom."
Girls,1,"Girls' genius (and that's the right word) is that we're always surprised by these characters' choices, good or bad, yet everything they do seems inevitable."
Girls,1,"I land -- just -- on the sympathetic side, because of some bravura writing, and similar performances."
Girls,1,"Straight back in, then, to Dunham's now-familiar world of millennial entitlement and ennui, and not much has changed."
Girls,1,"The one question I've never quite been able to answer about Girls is also one of the most crucial: Is the show sharp and self-aware, or oblivious and self-indulgent... I've come to the conclusion that the answer is - well, both."
Girls,1,"It was hard to imagine what a final season of Girls will look like, but this episode communicates a strong vision for it."
Girls,1,"We're not supposed to like [Ray and Jessa], and that is part of the beauty of a show that has realistically portrayed how ugly modern romance can sometimes be."
Girls,1,Girls' sense of specificity is both exclusive and inclusive.
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
Girls,1,"Lena Dunham's continuously uncompromising HBO series, Girls, remains intelligent, character-focused, fearless, relentless, unwavering, knowingly aggravating and heavily emotional in its highly dramatic, sure to be controversial final season."
Girls,1,"Girls is all of a piece - folding the sublime and the tasteless, the sloppy and the meticulous into nearly every scene - you have to accept the totality, including the parts you can't stand, otherwise you can't watch the show at all."
Girls,1,"Most of the time, Girls remains impressive, and as the series moves toward its conclusion, it looks more and more like the kind of TV cultural marker that will stand as a reference point for its period in history."
Girls,0,It's unlikely anything will be fully formed - characters or tone - by the end of the final episode. Girls will stay frustrating.
Girls,1,"Girls still contains all the perfect details that have defined its world in the past... But its ambitions, like Hannah's, seem to have benefited from realizing that the best stories have a deeper purpose than simple entertainment."
Girls,1,"The clamor about Girls may have died down, which is a relief. Based on the first three episodes, Dunham is ready to end her story with satirical precision and self-aware compassion."
Girls,1,Girls is back on solid and often increasingly inventive footing.
Girls,1,"In its final season, Girls shifts from blindered self-sabotage to dawning self-awareness."
Girls,1,Of course you'll love it. What else would you expect me to say?
Girls,1,"Whether you find all the noise Dunham generates to be cacophonous or harmonious, don't let it drown this out: Girls was great."
The Nevers,0,"[In] order to hold on to this show past just its one season, and in order for it to survive past the Joss Whedon shadow, it needs to make major changes."
The Nevers,0,"Truthfully, The Nevers has a lot to recommend it. But as a busy, frequently over-stuffed period sci-fi epic, it has an uphill battle ahead of it."
The Nevers,1,"Thanks to a whip-smart script, well-developed characters and a talented cast bringing its material to life, The Nevers almost never feels played out, even if its creator might be."
The Nevers,0,Kingsley Amis one complained that his son Martin's determinedly dazzling prose left him feeling 'bombarded by felicities'. The Nevers has a similar effect -- except that the would-be felicities are far less felicitous.
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
The Nevers,0,It just feels like there is thirty percent too much plot and rabbit holes not connected to other plot lines. ... It is just a bit too weighted down.
The Nevers,0,The Nevers has a lot going for it but it's a distillation of Whedon's best and worst filmmaking impulses. It needs someone with a more disciplined eye to cut half of its many dangling threads and subplots.
The Nevers,0,"A mess it is, which is a shame, because of all the too-much going on, a lot of it is a lot of fun."
The Nevers,1,"If ladies fighting in their nighties is your thing, then fill your button boots."
The Nevers,1,"I've only seen the first episode, but so far? Yes."
The Nevers,1,"The Nevers doesn't hit its stride until episode six, but with some narrative trimming, it has the bones to be a good show."
The Nevers,1,That the show is not a disaster and is even at times genuinely fun... Perhaps bringing a new and thoughtful eye to the series will be precisely what this genuinely interesting show concept needs to succeed.
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
The Nevers,1,"If you ever wondered what it would look like if Derren Brown was put in charge of X Men, The Nevers (Sky Atlantic) will put your mind at ease."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
The Nevers,0,"Who is The Nevers for? So far, not me."
The Nevers,1,"The Nevers is a series that's greater than the sum of its parts, and one that will ultimately stay in your memory long after the first half season's credits roll."
The Nevers,1,"To be frank, I'm not sure any of this would have remotely worked if the performances of Laura Donnelly and Farscape and Stargate SG-1 veteran Claudia Black weren't there to hold it together."
The Nevers,1,"Mess can be fun and, viewed as a steampunky romp, The Nevers is that. Long stretches could be Enola Holmes for grownups or Penny Dreadful for children. But it could - tightened and focused - be so much more."
The Nevers,0,"The show is being pulled in two different directions... If only we could agree to retcon the wayward sci-fi part of the story, HBO would have the best new prestige fantasy series on television. As it stands, it's likely to only get worse."
The Nevers,0,"There are too many characters, too many high-stakes plotlines, and not enough explanation for how it all connects."
The Nevers,1,"The show is coming into focus as something more ambitious and challenging than it originally appeared to be, and certainly something more unpackable and discussable."
The Nevers,1,"Production values are top notch, the dialogue crackles and I am looking forward to the next episodes with eagerness."
The Nevers,1,"The only thing that is for certain is that The Nevers rarely feels like a cohesive tale but one trying to cram too much into a shorter, marquee cable series run of ten episodes. While never a bad series, The Nevers is mostly a forgettable one."
The Nevers,0,"This potentially provocative, supernatural sci-fi series is unfocused and uneven."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is muddled, overcrowded, and less-than-engaging despite its complex lore and flashy special effects."
The Nevers,0,"If The Nevers does get to continue, having someone else in charge could be the special power it really needs."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers may get better when Whedon is no longer involved. It also may not. As it stands, the show is airing proof that Whedon's former proficiency, which insulated him from experiencing the consequences of his disturbing actions, has vanished."
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
The Nevers,1,"The Nevers is much more than standard superhero fare, encompassing science-fiction, horror, dark humour and a gorgeous steampunk aesthetic, while addressing the very topical issue of women having power -- and those who fear them."
The Nevers,1,"The series is ripe with relevant and important discussions to be had, and has a world that is easy to get immersed into. As far as the first episode goes, it has done it's job."
The Nevers,0,"The anchor on The Nevers is that it never seems to take off, at least from the episodes I've seen... For now, The Nevers never will do."
The Nevers,0,"There's nothing wrong with wanting The Nevers to be a unique vision, and disappointing to realize it gives us very little we haven't seen before."
The Nevers,1,"If you've ever had a problem with how Joss Whedon writes and depicts women, this series is not going to change that opinion, try as though the rest of the creative team might to remedy that."
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
The Nevers,1,"For all its fantastical conceits and sometimes challenging world-building, The Nevers' real strength is in its cast."
The Nevers,1,Its debut episode makes an impression. Though that's the case with a lot of HBO series - where it goes from here is the question.
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
The Nevers,1,The visuals dazzle and the action scenes thrill on a show that's part X-Men and part Doctor Who.
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
The Nevers,1,"It would fit a tidy narrative if The Nevers was terrible ... but it's not. The rollicking pilot, which Whedon wrote and directed, is the most unexpectedly entertaining, hour-long TV joyride so far this year."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
The Nevers,1,"It might all be too much of a hot mess were it not for the anchoring performances by Donnelly and Skelly as Amalia and Penance; they are both wonderful, and there's wit in the script."
The Nevers,1,"There's a lot of fun to be had with The Nevers, but it's still an untidy fiasco with a steampunk elephant lurking in the wings."
The Nevers,0,"""The Nevers,"" while handsomely produced and, from moment to moment, reasonably diverting, doesn't catch fire in those early episodes in part because we - along with the characters - are still trying to figure out what the heck is going on."
The Nevers,1,Lively and chaotic.
The Nevers,1,"You don't need Amalia's gift of foresight to see how transformative this could be, transcending Whedon's tired formula to create something bolder and more current, something less derivative of the many stories like this that have come before."
The Nevers,0,"""The Nevers'"" inconsistencies can make for a maddening viewing experience - sending you from the edge of your seat to sprawled out on the floor, trying to find your eyes after they rolled out of your head... But I'd be lying if I said I'm done."
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
The Nevers,1,The exciting revelations about Amalia's past promise to redefine the show's future. If it has one.
The Nevers,1,"Whether or not The Nevers cares to favor its characters over immensity in its later episodes remain to be seen, but I imagine viewers' patience with the Whedon-verse, and The Nevers' bloat, will be thin."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
The Nevers,0,"When I finished watching, there were no characters I felt drawn to, or provoked by. I took in all the excess and atmosphere, all the flippant banter and brutal fighting, and I was left untouched."
The Nevers,1,"This new period fantasy series from Joss Whedon (!) doesn't look like being overly subtle in making its points, but it does look likely to provide a bit of catharsis and a good deal of fun."
The Nevers,0,"It is, indeed, steampunk Buffy with corsets -- and for several reasons, that's no longer an enticing concept."
The Nevers,1,"A steampunk action adventure imbued with magic gone wild, fabulous femmes, and sharp witty banter that would make Oscar Wilde smile."
The Nevers,1,That The Nevers - a fantastical drama series debuting April 11 on HBO and streaming service HBO Max - is set in Victorian England gives it a welcome bit of personality.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
The Nevers,1,"The first four episodes of the series are a little messy, but undeniably entertaining."
The Nevers,1,"This period drama about the persecution - and power - of the marginalized goes wide on genre appeal, while homing in on painfully contemporary themes. And it's full of riddles designed to keep us hooked."
The Nevers,1,"""Victorian ladies with superpowers"" is already a high-concept idea, but The Nevers, while entertaining, somehow finds a way to make things even busier."
The Nevers,0,"Despite sexy intentions, the series is sometimes laughably prurient. Moreover, it's riddled with Whedon's signature dialogue that's entirely too self-aware with how smart it's trying to be."
The Nevers,1,"Donnelly's face is only one of the rich details to be appreciated in The Nevers, even while its creation feels so closely tied to its creator."
The Nevers,0,"A generous take on The Nevers is that it's a fin de siècle X-Men, or maybe a Victorian Watchmen. A less generous take is that it's a more expensive version of Fox's The Gifted, one made without any clear understanding of hour-long cable narrative rhythm."
The Nevers,0,"There's a lot of that carelessness throughout The Nevers. Or maybe it's just that there's simply a lot happening in The Nevers, and it's hard to keep track of it all."
The Nevers,0,"It feels empty, as if the scripts are just going through the motions; the characters have so little substance beyond their spunky quips that the dramatic moments, when they inevitably arrive, ooze into each episode like treacle."
The Nevers,0,Astonishingly pedestrian.
The Nevers,1,"Even when it errs towards the silly, it's fun and twisty enough to be an engaging page-turner of a show that should grow its own fanbase without much trouble."
30 Coins,1,"After seven incredible episodes, they stick the landing in the finale, and set up a jaw-dropping cliffhanger for a possible second season. 30 Coins is miraculous."
30 Coins,1,"The result is a series that resembles classic horror films like The Thing and The Exorcist. It lives in the shadow of those films, rather than creating shadows of its own."
30 Coins,1,It's a series of many treasures.
30 Coins,1,"It can be, at times, quite intriguing and even chilling, but at others, incredibly absurd. [Full review in Spanish]"
30 Coins,1,"Imagine an R-rated, blood-soaked National Treasure directed by Guillermo del Toro, and you'll have some idea of what to expect coming into this daring and dramatic religious fantasy horror series."
30 Coins,1,Even at a run-time in excess of eight hours this season races by and leaves you desperate for the devil's next move.
30 Coins,1,"Despite the broad narrative focus and widespread plot, 30 Coins ultimately remains rooted in the real terror of the way people treat one another in the face of fear."
30 Coins,1,There's enough going on during 30 Coins to keep a viewer interested.
30 Coins,1,"30 COINS is exciting, with its twists and turns keeping the viewer guessing until the very end."
30 Coins,1,"De la Iglesia continues to be a master of genre storytelling, using his brand of gallows humor, brutal violence and bloodletting, and engaging examinations of the human condition to explore age-old theological themes through a modern lens."
30 Coins,0,"Bogged down in dull relationship drama and a confusing, mutating conspiracy, with only occasional flashes of the weird horror that the concept and the first episode's opening scenes promise."
And Just Like That...,0,"A woke pamphlet…electing to preach about how the world works.
[Full review in Spanish]"
And Just Like That...,0,"Theres still lots of ardor for New York City (which is nice, especially post-pandemic) in And Just Like That, but there is nothing sexy about it."
And Just Like That...,0,"To say I was disappointed with where we ended up is something of an understatement. However, theres a spark of promise in some of these storylines, and if we get Season 2, its possible that the series could improve. Or maybe Im deluded."
And Just Like That...,0,The show did not achieve what they were trying to and felt very heavy-handed in its themes.
And Just Like That...,0,A sequel that was dead on arrival...
And Just Like That...,1,"Newness aside, the season also had plenty of what made the show great in the first place -- the strength of the bond its characters share."
And Just Like That...,1,Is it perfect? No. Is it cringey? Absolutely. But ultimately we cringe because we care—and I can’t stop cringing and caring about these gals about town.
And Just Like That...,1,"While the more sombre tone may disappoint some fans, it breathes creative life into a series whose fizzy adventures were very much of its moment."
And Just Like That...,0,The show feels like it's trying to reverse-engineer itself through a lot of virtue signaling...
And Just Like That...,1,"What persists, and perhaps it is one of the values ​​that the series clings to, is friendship. [Full review in Spanish]"
And Just Like That...,1,"I tune in each week, not hoping that they'll suddenly become fabulous again but that they learn something and keep moving. Because it seems that life does not get any better, you just get better at laughing at it."
And Just Like That...,1,"There are two shows fighting for dominance in this reboot... Only one of the two is good, and whether And Just Like That is painful or pleasurable at any given moment mostly depends on where we're landing."
And Just Like That...,1,"I actually kind of like it, because for the first time it's not struggling to be funny like the series was. It deals with the real stakes of these characters getting older."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
And Just Like That...,1,"I hadn't prepared for the fact that this is no longer a frivolous sitcom about sex and cocktails. It's an issue-led comedy drama about friendship, grief, age, love and loss... but that's OK."
And Just Like That...,1,Sometimes guilty pleasure is pleasure without any guilt. [Full review in Spanish]
And Just Like That...,0,"Samantha Jones's perverted yet sensible energy was what kept this show together, and without her, these women are in big trouble."
And Just Like That...,0,"The result of this sequel or reboot, while not being embarrassing, is quite disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
And Just Like That...,0,SATC worked so well because it confidently introduced viewers to trends and fashions. Now its characters are out of touch and trying to play catch up; it's just not as interesting to watch.
And Just Like That...,0,"Hopefully, we can get to a place where the angst-ridden characters spent a little less time lamenting their place in the cosmos, and more time ordering cosmos."
And Just Like That...,1,What was once 'sassy' is now 'somber.
And Just Like That...,1,It's necessary to highlight the series' best aspect... to be able to see the protagonists much more vulnerable from time to time. [Full review in Spanish]
And Just Like That...,1,"It's almost compulsively watchable, even when it's hard to tell if said watching is of the hate variety."
And Just Like That...,0,"As the show just-like-that shifts gears into a more somber and contemplative tone, I kept being reminded of a trenchant passage from Sondheim's Follies, when a jaded character sings, ""How do you wipe tears away/When your eyes are dry?"""
And Just Like That...,1,"Too big and not Big Enough, the long awaited Sex and the City evolution pushes its embossed envelope in directions we need and some, maybe we don't."
And Just Like That...,0,"Why is everyone so dulled down? This brings us to Samantha, whose absence may be the biggest presence on And Just Like That so far. There is no good way to write her out."
And Just Like That...,1,"It pulls the rug from under you, entirely, so I have to give it credit for that."
And Just Like That...,0,"Lacking sharp characterisation, believability and bite, this is a too-often cringey attempt to drag the women of Sex And The City into 2021."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... A New Chapter of Sex and the City is a clumsy, cringe-inducing revival that fails to recapture the magic of the original."
And Just Like That...,0,"Ah, well."
And Just Like That...,1,"I have to admit to plenty of laughs, and a comfort in the reunion of old friends. Prepare to giggle, cry, and cringe a lot."
And Just Like That...,1,"We're straight back into it. King comes to this with his T's crossed, and his I's dotted. But dancing down the road of nostalgia is never as simple as merely redressing the stage."
And Just Like That...,1,"Without Samantha, the show has no sense of humor. Nevertheless, there is something irritatingly compelling in the idea that these old characters might be made new again -- that we might all, if we want, find impetus to change for the better."
And Just Like That...,0,"Too often, even when King and company mean well, the new show gives in to all of SATC's worst and sloppiest instincts. Most of it is not terrible, though the parts that are are very, very terrible."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... is a massive departure from Sex and the City in all the worst ways. It trades in its wit for a humorless, tone-deaf sequel series that struggles to make any case for its existence."
And Just Like That...,1,"Sex and the City could do serious - divorce, cancer, infertility -- but it could do silly as well. Maybe the gals will come out the other end just fine and show us how fab your fifties can be."
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
And Just Like That...,0,"Nearly a quarter of a century later, And Just Like That affirms that Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda failed to mature into women any sane person would want to spend time with, let alone to grow up to be."
And Just Like That...,1,"Not that it's not clunky, but Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis slip into their roles with such ease that it does feel like seeing people you once knew who are now older and grayer and have different concerns."
And Just Like That...,1,"The girls are back-yes, without Samantha-and there is a palpably different vibe, one that proves there was still one more story left to tell, and a different way of telling it."
And Just Like That...,1,"It captures a lot of the heart and charm that the original did, alongside some hard emotional truths."
And Just Like That...,1,The show has announced itself as something that's about much more than just brunch and designer shoes. I hope it lives up to that.
And Just Like That...,0,Introducing a cross-section of different types of recurring characters -- love. Feeling like the series creators had a checklist of representation token boxes to check off... it's all trying way too hard -- hate.
And Just Like That...,1,"I came for the Cosmopolitans and the outfits, to have a laugh about how badly a 1990s empowerment sitcom translates in 2021. I leave feeling slightly existential -- and grateful."
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
And Just Like That...,1,"I wasn't sure what rich, white, privileged American women could have to say to me. But just as they did back in the SATC days, the gang pulled one out of their Philip Treacys', and now I'm hooked. Roll on episode 3."
And Just Like That...,1,"I'll keep watching because I adore these characters, but some of the magic of what makes these characters great is missing for me."
And Just Like That...,1,There's certainly potential here for another long-running series with a plethora of rich and intriguing new characters to explore portrayed by a talented cast.
And Just Like That...,1,"As the ladies dressed in their fabulous outfits bantered and discussed getting older the way many women friends do, it provided some of what the original always gave viewers: fun."
And Just Like That...,1,"Really, the greatest joy of And Just Like That... is also its most modest one: the simple pleasure of being back in the company of the women we know and love."
And Just Like That...,1,"""And Just Like That"" is fancifully, fittingly, frustratingly beholden to its past. But we'll gladly follow these ladies' stiletto heels wherever they go next."
And Just Like That...,1,"For viewers who can make it past this bumpy beginning, this new chapter starts to settle into its changes in the second episode."
And Just Like That...,1,Middle age has come with a certain grace.
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
And Just Like That...,1,"There are a few sticking points here and there that will annoy fans (like me), but the mere fact that this series isn't Sex and the City 2-level awful, even with its core foursome fractured, is a victory to celebrate."
And Just Like That...,1,"Maybe we don't need a new ""Sex and the City"" series right now, but boy do we have one - and just like that, I'll be watching again."
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
And Just Like That...,1,"It knows its main characters are older, whiter and completely out of step. It is a brave, unexpected and ultimately rewarding move."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
And Just Like That...,0,"As a cultural moment, the story of Carrie & Friends is perhaps best left in the past. Dragging it into the present can only offer diminishing returns."
And Just Like That...,1,"[It] handles its return with grace and, unlike a lot of reboots, proves it's worthy of a comeback, if only to show us that there's life for women on television between ""Euphoria"" and ""Grace and Frankie."""
And Just Like That...,1,"There is a handful of good lines, there are flashes of the old spirit..."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
And Just Like That...,1,"It feels like less of a zombie show, clawing ghoulishly at 2021 realities, than I feared it would."
And Just Like That...,1,"A sometimes awkward, sometimes touching, and always soapy effort to usher the characters into their 50s and the IP into the era of Black Lives Matter and gender awareness."
And Just Like That...,0,Ask not whether fans needed this reboot but why Parker and King wanted to go to all this trouble in the first place.
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
And Just Like That...,1,I embrace the brooding and pensiveness of a series about three women in their mid-50s pinpointing the ways in which their lives have agonizingly changed or agonizingly remained static as they've aged.
And Just Like That...,1,"And Just Like That tries too hard to bring its cultural brand into a new era, but it reclaims a core humanity lacking in the previous franchise extensions."
And Just Like That...,1,"""And Just Like That"" is a smart, layered, insightful gem with true dramatic gravitas but also the same sense of style and upper middle-class, Manhattan-centric escapism as the original."
And Just Like That...,0,"We recognize these characters, but it's not just someone at the table who's missing - it's an energy."
And Just Like That...,0,"The reboot's hour-long episodes do not suit the material like the original's breezy, half-hour episodes. Here, there's more space between jokes and more space still between funny ones."
The Alienist,1,"The Alienist returns with the same handsome-looking production and entertaining fusion of history and fictional embellishment, and with Dakota Fanning's Sara Howard occupying the limelight there's plenty of potential in this new season."
The Alienist,1,"An impressive follow-up season to the excellent first. Although Season 2 isn't my favourite of the two, it remains a great group of episodes"
The Alienist,1,"While the dialogue at times gets hokey, there is an earnestness at work behind every performance, stitched into every costume and painted into each drab street sign."
The Alienist,1,"While Angel of Darkness has its blaringly anachronistic moments, it's well-tooled and visually detailed enough to keep you coming back for more genteel punishment."
The Alienist,1,This is a complex crime story with enough twists and turns to keep even the most experienced genre addict on their toes.
The Alienist,1,"Atmospheric and boasting some impressive costumes and production design, what The Alienist lacks in story polish, it makes up for in its characters."
The Alienist,1,"Just when you think that The Alienist couldn't possibly get any darker, it does."
The Alienist,1,"All of these groups can cause headaches or worse for our protagonists, and you can feel an added layer of tension in the episode."
The Alienist,1,"Sometimes all you want is a really compelling murder mystery with high production value and compelling characters, and in that way The Alienist: Angel of Darkness delivers."
The Alienist,0,"The dialogue is stodgy and the mystery nowhere near as gripping as TV's other show about a mom falsely accused of her child's murder, Perry Mason. But it's just good enough, and you can't beat the period atmosphere."
The Alienist,1,"Every week it reveals just enough to keep us coming back, mixing gothic ambiance with bloody murder and shared feelings too dangerous to admit."
The Alienist,1,"The Alienist: Angel of Darkness feels more slight than the first season in the way its mystery plays out, but is still an enjoyable watch thanks to the show's playing up of the melodrama its core characters and the expanded thrills and twists."
The Alienist,1,The Alienist: Angel of Darkness is a very distinct look into a challenging era for America that gives us something different than other shows currently on the air.
The Alienist,1,"With a richness and polish which you expect from more seasoned shows, The Alienist throws its doors open to those willing to venture inside."
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
The Alienist,1,Angel of Darkness is immaculate from top to bottom.
The Alienist,0,"Not a bit of the original's atmospheric quality is lost in the years that have passed between the two seasons... If the goal of Angel of Darkness is to speak to the now and make us think, however, that trail only leads to a dead end."
The Alienist,1,"It's a heavy subject, but it's one the show is nailing so far by keeping the empathy and sympathy as a primary concern beyond the investigation."
The Alienist,1,"Two episodes back-to-back gives the show's new plot a lot more heft. But it also underlines an issue that's been ongoing since the show's first season. Despite the name ""The Alienist"" referring to Kreizler... he is often a third-ran."
The Alienist,1,An extremely appeasing and watchable result with [Dakota] Fanning firmly taking the lead with aplomb.
The Alienist,1,The second season is better than the first. It keeps the atmosphere of the first season along with the talent of the actors then adds a better plot.
The Alienist,1,"Angel of Darkness bites off a lot more than The Alienist did the first time around, capitalizing on its team's established relationships to dig a little deeper into the issues of its time, and doesn't quite pull all of it off."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"Apatow has done much to illuminate the art form and its practitioners, and his new George Carlin documentary is another vital document."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,Monumental... [Full review in Spanish]
George Carlin's American Dream,1,Don’t miss this.
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The brilliant documentary, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio delights and instructs."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"It’s not quite as piercing as Apatow’s Shandling doc, but it’s still a pretty thorough and engaging look at who Carlin was and how he frustratingly refused to fit into the box you’d want him to fit in."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,A clear-eyed portrait that also delivers lots of laughs.
George Carlin's American Dream,1,The triumph of Carlin... is that his voice still resonates. All the searing cautions he left behind are still right there in front of us.
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"“What they think is anger, is a real contempt for the choices that my fellow humans have made. I just feel betrayed by the bullshit in America that’s all around us.” [George Carlin] How many more Americans feel that way in 2022, do you figure?"
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The documentary does a nice job bookending with the most, let’s say, timely version of Carlin while still digging into the others..."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The result is a comprehensive, if sometimes a little dry, look into Carlin’s life."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"The two-part doc showcases all of the icon’s incredible career across 50 years and shows sides of him that most have never seen before including the earliest routines of the legendary comedian, as well as intimate details of his personal life."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio have created the extreme fan-boy documentary of counterculture comedian George Carlin’s life, times and personal struggles."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"Assembled with a level of ambition worthy of Carlin's verbal dexterity, directors Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio have endeavored to contextualize the comic's work through key events that framed those years."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"It digs into Carlin’s personal life in a way that’s honestly moving, showing the big heart behind the persona that was often falsely perceived as misanthropic."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, who co-direct the documentary, do a wonderful job of weaving it all together and telling George Carlin's story in about four hours."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"A celebration of an incredibly smart, undeniably funny man who had an amazing way with words—and a beautiful, lifelong disdain for any powerful institution or individual that oppressed and exploited others."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"[I]t paints a vivid, deeply insightful picture of someone who was less a nihilist than perpetually disappointed and heartbroken over the state of the world, and the country he loved."
George Carlin's American Dream,1,Four hours spent listening to George Carlin is four hours well-spent.
George Carlin's American Dream,1,"Rather than leaving audiences feeling sentimental about Carlin and his deep abiding love for individuals, Apatow and Bonfiglio repeatedly slam audiences in the face with how bad the world is now."
Entourage,1,"Though the four friends always kept us coming back for more, Vince's agent, Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven), was the real driving force of the show."
Entourage,0,"Boy did the show coast for a long, long, long time, all the way up until this limp, unenthusiastic finale."
Entourage,1,"It's been a brilliant eight years, and I can't think of a better way for the programme to have gone out - it truly does end on such a high."
Entourage,1,"People think that love can't last in Hollywood, but in real life friendship is more capricious. Entourage nurtured the fantasy that some bonds are so precious that nothing, not even fame, money and sex, can tear them asunder."
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
Entourage,0,"The quality in Entourage's storytelling has been in steady decline, and last season even felt forced... I wish I could say it looks as though the eighth and final season is going to be better. I really can't."
Entourage,1,"Luckily for us, this finale was everything the audience hoped it would be. When the credits first rolled, I had a huge smile on my face"
Entourage,0,It struck me that the show seems even more like escapist candy than it did just a few years ago... Entourage stopped trying to even toy with realism or emotional depth.
Entourage,1,It does an excellent job of protecting the fantasy it has created by almost never putting audiences in a position where they have to ask if they really believe in a particular plot development.
Entourage,1,"By the time this otherwise wonderful final season reaches its end, it's practically running there, and painfully out of breath."
Entourage,1,It's pointless dwelling on what a show isn't. I might have wished that some stories hadn't been so rapidly curtailed... But darkness didn't suit Entourage.
Entourage,0,The final outcomes in the series finale were predictable and saccharine.
Entourage,0,Entourage completely lost sight of what it was.
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
Entourage,1,"We've been here before, but there's pleasure in the return trip. It feels like a reassuring final season."
Entourage,1,"Entourage looks as though it still has enough juice -- comedy, drama and Drama-wise -- to make its last season a keeper."
Entourage,1,"Caan and Coates manage to give two classic Hollywood stereotypes such real flesh and bones, that you'll wish that Season 8 was the precursor to Season 9."
Entourage,1,Entourage offers a reason for fans to be encouraged about the quality of its last episodes.
Entourage,0,We shall see if the boys become men by the end of this eight-episode season. But I doubt it; they're talking movies now.
Entourage,0,"Without a compelling storyline since the fourth or fifth season, Entourage feels like it's stuck around this long solely out of habit."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
Entourage,1,"I can't disagree with those who insist the show passed its sell-by date a few years back, but it doesn't mean I'm not still fond enough of these guys to keep watching."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
Entourage,0,"That the new season begins with Vince having left that murk behind reinforces a consistent criticism of Entourage, that it's a lark and nobody every changes."
Entourage,1,"Entourage has avoided teaching us lessons about greed-head ambition; if anything, its flaw has been its throbbing sentimentality about the bonds of bro-ship."
Entourage,0,"Look, you've had your fun, Entourage. Those viewers who thought the party got old? They don't need to hug it out."
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Warrior,1,"Warrior is about the many Americans who have not (and probably will never) really belong, but who have no choice but to keep grinding for the chance at a small piece of the American dream."
Warrior,1,"Warrior returns just as great as the first season, and I can't wait for more."
Warrior,1,"There is a power that comes with a series like Warrior, one that hits harder than any punch...Warrior Season 2 is off to a strong start that sets the expectations for episodes to come by telling audiences exactly where it stands."
Warrior,1,The series deserves to fight another day...
Warrior,1,Warrior may just be the most welcomingly subversive piece of popcorn entertainment on TV right now.
Chuck,1,This is a program with some clever writing and a strong ensemble that has still never quite figured out its identity.
Chuck,1,"With a strong start to the final season of Chuck, ""Chuck vs. the Zoom"" is full of all the things that have made this show great."
Chuck,1,"While [the finale's] sad, it is a bit hopeful."
Chuck,1,There were enough solid episodes (and Yvonne Strahovski wardrobe highlights) along the way to keep it just interesting enough to reward the investment.
Chuck,1,"But while the show undeniably got darker towards the end, he was still the same Chuck Bartowski at heart."
Chuck,1,"In retrospect, Chuck went on a little too long with a premise that was probably worth two good seasons, but it still made me smile enough that I was never annoyed to see it return."
Chuck,1,I enjoyed the hell out of that.
Chuck,1,Chuck's life and death speaks in surprisingly potent ways to how television is changing.
Chuck,1,"It's been a long time since I saw a show go out so perfectly on its own terms. In the end, all I could do was sit there with tears in my eyes and sigh with content."
Chuck,1,"Still, despite its flaws, it's nice to have a farewell romp with Chuck, Sarah, Casey and Morgan before they leave us behind for good."
Chuck,1,"So it's farewell and goodbye to one of the most unique shows on TV: one that combined great action scenes with snappy one-liners, unique characterisation, more pop culture references and iconic guest star"
Chuck,1,"Chuck might not go down in history as the most masterful TV series of all time, but dangit, it had more heart than 99 percent of the shows out there."
Chuck,1,The kiss at the end highlighted [Sarah's] intent of wanting to be with Chuck - but it was the tearful moments that came before all of that where the real ending of the series lies.
Chuck,1,"Hot damn, I'm going to miss what this show did when it was really cooking with gas, which it was on its final Friday night."
Chuck,1,"I saw promise for a great ending to this personally iconic television series, which has me on a high."
Chuck,1,I'm glad that Chuck is back
Chuck,1,"There are lots of kinks in this final season premire, but there's a lot of fun, as well."
Chuck,1,"Chuck, I'm very glad to have you back. I have always loved this show, but am frankly amazed to find myself reviewing the Season 5 premiere."
Chuck,1,"As ever, it's difficult to care too much about what happens plotwise, but the result is a decent start to the show's victory lap/funeral parade."
Chuck,1,"When I started watching the final season, I wasn't sure that it would [go out with a bang]. By the time I got to the third episode, I felt significantly more confident."
Chuck,1,A big fat wink to fans. The fifth season looks like a winner.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"It's been done before, and will be again — officially and in everything else that's taken cues from the original Swedish series — but here and now, this series works as grippingly and movingly as it does because of its stars."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Its not exactly pleasant to watch, but its honest and its human."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are true devotees to the technical side of their craft, and their training pays enormous dividends in Scenes from a Marriage."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,The miniseries is a tour de force for its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"This eminently watchable series is a searing portrait of a relationship that seems strong enough to survive anything, yet turns out to be so changeable that it breaks apart unexpectedly, like a stormcloud, or a seedpod, or a murmuration."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Scenes From a Marriage might be an unnecessary update, but when it's at its best, Chastain and Isaac make it feel essential."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,Two extraordinary and compassionate performances from Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Lacking the humanity of Bergman's version, the dispassionate tone of Scenes From A Marriage doesn't move you but it's worth staying with for spectacular performances from Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"The first time it happened, I thought I'd pressed play on a behind-the-scenes special. By the time episode three rolled around, I started shouting 'No!' at the telly."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Levi's camera, as much as Bergman's, goes to the soul of that marriage. [Full re view in Spanish]"
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Never mind the narrow focus: as Bergman knew, you can plunge deep, deep into the human heart and never reach the bottom."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac are superb, giving masterclass performances and delivering crackling, wounding dialogue faultlessly as the marriage starts to bleed out."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Luckily, the new version has so much fine acting and such a mature and intelligent script that it more than merits its existence."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Nothing here, be it questions or attempted answers, is new... But they are rarely explored with such style, truth or credibility. Just be sure to have a lawyer or a therapist on standby when the credits roll."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"The limited series follows the extrication - object by object, memory by memory - of a shared life with a painful, resounding realism and an almost unbearable intensity."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"This is a serious, talky two-hander with very little distraction from the horrible emotional work of extricating your life from someone else's -- but in the hands of Chastain and Isaac, two magnetic actors at the top of their game, it's hard to look away."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"HBO's Scenes From a Marriage will no doubt be watched by an audience largely unfamiliar with Bergman's original, and if it existed only to provide Chastain and Isaac a chance to display their acting chops it would still be a worthwhile endeavor."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"With powerful dialogue and perfectly sculpted characters, this is an intelligent, insightful examination of modern relationships that rivals Marriage Story for raw emotive power and is reminiscent of Closer for its painful, unspoken truths."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"It's an embarrassment of riches, to be sure, but never ostentatious with its merits - carefully crafted and mindfully executed, even if the story is all-too familiar."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"Together, they deliver anguished, nuanced portraits that are diminished by Levi's interruptions."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain make a fiery pair of mates, bickering and reconnecting in an update of the Ingmar Bergman masterpiece."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"The spectacle of watching two very hot A-listers gnash their teeth, grovel, hate fuck, and mentally and physically flagellate each other is what we are here for, and in this the series accommodates."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,Simple but highly effective...
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"One does not come to Scenes From a Marriage for plot, much of which is absurd. One comes for the acting, which is largely superb."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It reeks of prestige, but Scenes From a Marriage ultimately lacks the warmth, humour or universality to be truly great. In the end, it's just a slightly pallid imitation of life."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,Expecting a series equal to what Bergman achieved would be expecting too much indeed... Yet the acting and writing manage to overcome any qualms.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's possible to admire the artistry and hard work that went into this production without feeling truly engaged by it, either emotionally or intellectually."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Watching Isaac and Chastain impressively tango, spar, and exchange carefully choreographed fireworks displays is enough of a reason to take in Scenes From a Marriage."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Scenes from a Marriage is a whole mess of gray, and if that's what we all feel after watching it, then perhaps it did its job."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Everything is so ""real"" that it's obviously a studied facsimile of real life. Still, Isaac and Chastain are brilliant."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,Scenes From A Marriage works simply because of Chastain and Isaac. Can we put up with the depressing story just to see their performances? The jury is still out on that.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,[Scenes From a Marriage] has been updated for a new generation and modern sensibilities with equally thought-provoking and engrossing results.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"It can be kind of talky. But the acting is so strong, and the issues so deep, it's hard not to be compelled by its courageous soul-searching."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"[Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain] are at the top of their game here, delivering career-best performances."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"May not be enough to entice you to make a five-week commitment to ""Scenes,"" but don't make that call before at least saying ""I do"" to the premiere."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"The drama unfolding on screen [is] too real, too lifelike for comfort. Maybe that's what makes Levi's take so beautiful, so devastating, and so memorable."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,I think the real charm of both this series and the original - and the secret to their success - is that they tell us that even people who seem to have the most charmed lives are really just as troubled and confused as the rest of us.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,This is an absolutely perfect work of filmmaking and acting that will not be rivaled by anything else this year.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's a master class that deserves recognition, and both actors reach the depth required to sell the dialogue. I just wish the material was worthy of their talents."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"As a whole, Scenes from a Marriage doesn't always match the intensity of Chastain's and Isaac's performances. But when they burn white-hot, it's difficult to look away."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"... a provocative piece that beckons to our voyeuristic nature. It's a sensual, even a little naughty, exercise to allow a viewer to eavesdrop on such an intimate performance."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"I found myself repeatedly impressed by the craft and technique's sheer blunt-force impressiveness, yet awkwardly, even guiltily, unmoved."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,It's a better-than-average TV show adapted from a masterpiece that you can still watch in the comfort of your all-too-delicately constructed home.
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Regardless of my skepticism toward Levi's reasons for undertaking this remake, he is a tremendous performance-driven director, and he captures the animosity and desire between his two leads in a way that builds momentum."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"""Scenes From a Marriage"" is curious to watch in contrast to Bergman's original, just as it's tender craft and measured performances make it easy to admire."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"What's left is to watch the fireworks as Chastain and Isaac immolate one another, and those are indeed spectacular. But sitting through five hours of rage -- that's a big ask."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"This new ""Scenes"" can be hell to sit through across most of its five hours. Yet as a showcase for the deep talents and remarkable chemistry of its stars, it can be one hell of a thing."
Scenes From a Marriage,1,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chastain and Isaac are absolutely outstanding in it, capturing emotional injury, selfishness, self-preservation, and despair with an accuracy that may leave you curled up in a ball, needing time to recover before the next episode."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,1,This show demonstrates all the ways the “Star Wars” universe can revisit familiar faces and places without feeling like a simple retread.
Obi-Wan Kenobi,1,Genre stories like Obi-Wan Kenobi are today’s dominant fictional narratives. It’s not a slight to subject them to impassioned analysis or critical inquiry; it’s a sign of respect.
Ms. Marvel,1,Ms. Marvel feels like the first Disney+ show to really focus on the “origin” part of the origin story and get it right.
Ms. Marvel,1,"The marriage of Islamic customs with South Asian cultural heritage – the music, the clothes, the dancing – is all the more remarkable in how it illustrates that Muslim lives are nowhere as uniform as western film and TV habitually makes them out to be."
Ms. Marvel,1,"Sensational stuff, a comic book dream & a brilliant message of tolerance/trust of our fellow world beings. It always seems to be art that makes the statements that we need to be better toward one another, and MS. MARVEL is leading the way. Shazam! Oops."
Ms. Marvel,1,Deepening this tale about a teen desperate to follow her heart — a story that's hardly unique — is how wonderfully culturally specific Ms Marvel proves.
Ms. Marvel,1,"Marvel Studios found a winner with Iman Vellani, who brings the charm and is a refreshing addition to the Marvel heroes lineup."
Ms. Marvel,1,"Ms. Marvel doesn't reinvent the superhero wheel. Instead, it dips it in gold and bedazzles it with eye-melting visuals."
Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.
Moon Knight,1,The first MCU Disney+ series that doesn't feel like homework.
Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a fun six part story, though some early and mid episodes are a little lacking it soon picks up, and even then those episodes are often full of great acting from Oscar Isaac as the duel personalities of our “hero”. Wouldn’t say no to more!"
Moon Knight,1,"There's action… lots of humor, and a lead doing extraordinary work in a double role.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Moon Knight,1,"Promises to blend mythology and adventure, time travel, large-scale confrontations, a tortured and ambivalent protagonist, and a sufficiently engaging villain… [Full review in Spanish]"
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight’s early episodes feel inert in comparison to the thrilling last stretch, its revelations relying too heavily on the show withholding information, instead of inviting viewers to want to find out more."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight has turned out to be one of the better Marvel series, mostly because it feels different. The show is supposedly set in the same universe as the Avengers, but viewers can enjoy it as a stand-alone series."
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Moon Knight,1,The ending of Episode 6 takes a brilliant turn.
Moon Knight,1,"While Marvel, and the entertainment world at large, still have a long way to go in terms of representation, Moon Knight is a nice opening into the Middle Eastern culture both past and present."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is good, but it could have been great."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a refreshing chapter in the MCU Universe with a compelling story, great character development, and top-notch performances by cast members."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight's penultimate episode is, undoubtedly, its best yet. Oscar Isaac is a tour de force, churning in top-tier performances as both Marc Spector and Steven Grant."
Moon Knight,1,"It establishes the Marvel miniseries not just as add-ons that wrap up stories from already-established names and faces, but rather as a tool that can stand on its own as a functional, exciting, and informative piece in the larger Marvel story."
Moon Knight,1,"It might be unfamiliar territory for much of the Marvel movie-loving audience, but thanks to Isaacs heartbreaking characterizations, the unconventional premise and disjointed story breaks make it feel grounded."
Moon Knight,1,"This show takes its time, and I respect the heck out of it for that."
Moon Knight,1,"I love the non-binging aspect, which challenges people more and more. There's a lot to enjoy and savor here."
Moon Knight,1,"Marvel nerds are sure to be talking about this one, but it seems likely that a broader audience will get sucked into the Moon Knight story world too."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is slow, and ponderous, and only strange in fits and starts, at least until the back half of the series when it commits to the surrealism inherent in its premise."
Moon Knight,1,"There's enough intrigue established to inspire curiosity about just how it's all going to play out, in the end, and Isaacs's performance alone is enough to recommend it."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight is a seductively dark series that manages to be both eerie and shadowy and full of hijinks.
Moon Knight,1,I didn't know what was going on half the time but I still kind of liked it.
Moon Knight,1,"Due to the deeper mythology and the diversity of the characters, theres a lot to enjoy. It feels respectful, instead of a cultural grab for the sake of something different."
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
Moon Knight,1,"I cared more about this very scared and beautiful man, this bumbling idiot, than I have cared about any Marvel character for a long time."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight's opening episode makes it clear that this series cares about showing the aftermath of otherworldly power and the destruction it brings to humanity.
Moon Knight,1,"it just gets better and better. Oscar Isaac gives one of the funnest, if not one of the best turns of his career"
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight combines the ancient mythology of the Thor films with the campy tomb-hunting of the Mummy franchise, resulting a series that's often fun but with a bit of a muddled tone."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight, literally and figuratively, has dissociative identity disorder -- in the battle for coherent narrative, at least, and infrequently summoning the suit just doesn't cut through all that clutter."
Moon Knight,1,"Marvel Studios is taking a gamble with Moon Knight as the series is not nearly as family friendly as their other series. Its certainly a darker, scarier, and more intellectually probing piece for Marvel"
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight rides on Oscar Isaac’s ability to believably inhabit distinct personalities, but that might be more than enough for people to watch this six-episode MCU side story."
Moon Knight,0,A six-hour series that would have worked better as a two-and-a-half-hour film.
Moon Knight,1,"Coming off a comedic, fan-service-driven entry like No Way Home seems like the perfect time to go in the opposite direction... Peppering in horror would be a great way to do that, and Moon Knight is a small but satisfying step in that direction."
Moon Knight,1,"Its the strangeness that keeps the show incredibly enticing, and though its understandable why it needs to calm itself at times to explain what exactly is going on, the moments it decides to embrace lunacy prove its most exciting."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac is brilliant & hilarious, able to switch between the two personas effortlessly. He's the reason that got me hooked. If he were the only actor on the show, I'd still be entertained even when I don't always know what in the world is going on."
Moon Knight,1,"Whatever the case, he’s terrific fun to watch. If anything, Moon Knight works far better as a virtuoso acting display by Isaac than as a satisfactory story."
Moon Knight,1,"While the series loses momentum in its middle episodes, the rhythm among its wild spectacle, compelling mythos and adventure tune into a new, enjoyably offbeat Marvel entry."
Moon Knight,1,"Steven Grant may not feel like a hero, but in one episode, Moon Knight already gave us the best new Marvel lead in years."
Moon Knight,1,"Isaac’s having fun and that fun is infectious whenever Steven is on screen. Accuracy is overvalued in acting, innit? I’d much prefer watching Steven Grant destroy a loo."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a different side of Marvel. Dark, unique, and also all over the place. Some of the risks pay off, while others leave the audience perplexed. Humor offsets some of the darkness, but also very violent for younger kids."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac acts his asp off as Marvel's ""Moon Knight,"" yet the action-challenged series still sputters."
Moon Knight,1,"I’m hooked, and suspect you will be, too, even if you have to seek the consul of Wikipedia."
Moon Knight,1,"While “Moon Knight” may not rank as one of the great MCU titles, it’s not a bad aesthetic experience. The style is engaging, and even more entertaining is the lead performance."
Moon Knight,1,"Watching Moon Knights first 4 episodes, I kept on thinking of FXs Legion and the 90s classic: The Mummy. diandrareviews"
Moon Knight,1,"Like Don Cheadle in ""Ocean's Eleven"" and Dick Van Dyke in ""Mary Poppins,"" Isaac falls on the right side of the dodgy accent, enthusiastic performance line. ... He seems to have a blast going full weirdo character actor."
Moon Knight,1,"Isaac gives it his all, playing multiple characters, doing various accents, and bounding about all over the place like a human pinball."
Moon Knight,1,Isaac himself is a better special effect than all of the digital bandages in virtual Egypt.
Moon Knight,1,"This is different from anything Marvel has attempted before. The locations, to the style, the trippy psychological, & the great talent behind the characters. Im here for it all & excited to see what's next! Different isnt even half of it!"
Moon Knight,1,"It offers hope that the show will not fall back on the typical arc of superhero stories, as WandaVision did, and try something a little bit weird."
Moon Knight,1,"This show is built for both longtime fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and newcomers to the House of Ideas heroes, and its off to a great start."
Moon Knight,1,"We may not need another hero, but, if we did, better Moon Knight than Dark Knight."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight makes a case for its watchability through its pulpiness and its weirdness.
Moon Knight,0,"Despite the centrality of a mental break to its proceedings, the series largely pretends at psychological depth."
Moon Knight,1,Another fine feather in the Marvel cap ... Great stuff!
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knights concept is interesting and the execution is ok, but the real question isis it necessary?"
Moon Knight,1,This is an entertaining sliver of the MCU that plays like “Minority Report” meets “National Treasure” meets “Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde” meets “Split” meets “Venom.” (That’s a lot of meeting.)
Moon Knight,1,"A smart, thrilling adventure that questions the nature of heroism and identity, and also happens to be the best Disney+ Marvel project to date."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a complex character that takes some time to settle in to grasp the dualityalthough once alight, you cant help but have a good time predicting what these two are going to do nextas Oscar Issac truly glows in this role!"
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight as a show succeeds because of the way that Oscar Isaac threw himself into the role. You could tell from every moment that he was on-screen that he understood the assignment.
Moon Knight,1,An adaptation sure to satiate fans looking to see something more unique. Going beyond an action-adventure as series creator Jeremy Slater is clearly on a mission to bring more horror elements into the show.
Moon Knight,1,"Goodnight, Moon? More like good job. After zipping through four episodes, I’m eager to see more."
Moon Knight,1,"Perfectly ok...but another movie cut into unnecessarily long episodes to justify content...Although on one hand means knowing the ingredients better, it's frustrating when said ingredients are not enough for a banquet, when it could've been a great meal."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight is a must watch not only for fans of the MCU but for everyone!
Moon Knight,1,"Hints at what the superhero show will ultimately be. It looks pretty good, if we have the patience to wait for it to get there."
Moon Knight,1,"Just like Iron Man, one gets the feeling that Moon Knight -- if it can hang onto its sense of mystery and adventure -- just might be the start of something much, much bigger."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
Moon Knight,1,Marvel's Moon Knight is Indiana Jones with supernatural elements. Oscars handling of the dual roles is magnificent. Oscar transforms his facial features between Steven and Marc. You instantly know what character he is inhabiting.
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a trip! Unique and refreshing, it's top tier MCU series. Oscar Isaac is fantastic, and the darkhorror tone, humor and action, are all brilliant. Full review in Spanish"
Moon Knight,1,It's undeniably refreshing to take a step back from the tangle of the MCU...
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight plays out as an insular psychodrama involving the three characters played by Isaac, only one of which... is clearly defined enough to hold our interest."
Moon Knight,0,"...audiences that are looking for a unique and dynamic approach to one of the more unorthodox heroes in Marvels repertoire, Moon Knight is a disappointment."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is the the scariest MCU project to date, and the closest the franchise has come to outright horror."
Moon Knight,1,"'Moon Knight' delivers on its promise of a very different Marvel superhero, with Oscar Isaac's lead performance and a truly bizarre story adding up to the best MCU show on Disney Plus to date."
Moon Knight,1,"This costumed hero murders, frequently and remorselessly, and while his initial outing isn’t an outright killer, it remains additional evidence of Marvel’s peerless capacity for rehashing formulas in novel, charismatic, and entertaining fashion."
Moon Knight,1,"At the end of the day, is having a strong lead like Isaac enough to keep a series going? Previous Marvel shows have had two characters playing off of one another, but perhaps having the two sides of Marc and Steven is enough."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac is perfect for Moon Knight,  with his interpretative shadings. Ethan Hawke plunges into his religious cultist, imbuing him with a frightening mystery that is both creepy and beguiling. New Marvel-ous Superheroes .. hope we can all keep up!"
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Moon Knight,0,The first three quarters of this six-episode season is a vague story that takes a long time to go nowhere. There's not enough character for a character study and not a clear enough plot for a satisfying thriller.
Moon Knight,1,"This will likely be a fan favorite with people being over the moon after seeing it. Egyptian mythology and culture are rich, the acting is engaging, the action and suspense are thrilling, the costumes and sets are spot-on, and the writing is cohesive."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a type of character we've never seen on screen in the MCU and aside from the Netflix series, it's Marvel's darkest MCU show to date."
Moon Knight,1,A choppy show through its first four episodes that's still a must-see simply for what Oscar Isaac does in a fascinating dual performance.
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight might be darker, and different, but its still wholly captivating in a way Marvel has managed to achieve more often than not."
Moon Knight,1,Supplies fair to middling action and sentiment and consistently satisfying laughs.
Moon Knight,0,Oscar Isaac can't salvage middle tier MCU entry.
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight brings us a story unlike any other in the MCU. Its faithfulness to the madness of its comic origin is spot on, but the storytelling brings it to life in a completely unexpected way."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is so bewilderingly convoluted as to be almost invulnerable to spoilers. It is less immune, however, to criticisms of lacklustre scripting, tortuous plotting and pseudo-philosophical musings about human nature and identity."
Moon Knight,1,Oscar Isaac is a great addition to this mythos and Ethan Hawke already ranks as one of the best Marvel villains yet. My only complaint is that six episodes are not nearly enough Moon Knight and I already want more.
Moon Knight,1,"Hardcore fans of the character may quibble with some of the changes made to the mythos, but Isaac and Hawke really sell this character-oriented Marvel adventure."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is experimental, unique, an exciting ride and delivers a brilliant new character to the MCU, all the while boasting action-packed and emotion-filled sequences to boot."
Moon Knight,0,"It ends up feeling both bloated and disposable, something that ultimately has no great purpose to exist other than as another piece of content thrown into the jaws of the Disney+ machine."
Moon Knight,1,The highest compliment I can give Moon Knight is that it often feels more like The Mummy than The Avengers.
Moon Knight,1,I like weird. But this is really something.
Moon Knight,1,"Part comedy, part action-adventure, and with touches of romance and horror, Moon Knight is diverse in its storytelling, making it weird in the best ways possible."
Moon Knight,1,"The show becomes increasingly complex and engrossing, smashing dramatic expectations to smithereens."
Moon Knight,1,Moon Knight remains wonderfully unpredictable every step of the way.
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is an MCU departure in both topic and tone, spicing the superhero formula with a cocktail of comedy-horror and a twist of old- school adventure."
Moon Knight,1,"If you thought the torrent of big-budget television had dulled its capacity to surprise, get ready for this."
Moon Knight,1,Isaac always commands your attention as the guy(s) behind the suit(s).
Moon Knight,0,"There are many interesting aspects to Moon Knight, but neither the comic books nor this TV show named for him quite know what to do with them all."
Moon Knight,0,"Housed within another movie stretched into a series, “Moon Knight” dulls two stars that should be lighting up the Marvel universe."
Moon Knight,1,"From the first few episodes of this thrilling trip into the darker side of Marvel, we’re absolutely all in with the combination of grounded drama... and horror that propels the show."
Moon Knight,0,"Flashes of brilliance offer a glimpse of the more introspective, imaginative show we were promised, and the finale has the opportunity to deliver. As it stands, though, Marvel Studios' latest Disney+ outing is also its most disappointing."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a massive show, packed to the brim with excellent character moments. It does an excellent job of introducing the title character to the masses, and clips along at a brisk pace. Isaac is a perfect addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Moon Knight,1,"With Moon Knight, Marvel Studios continues to be a bit more daring on the small screen, as it has been with the terrific WandaVision and the uneven-but-interesting Loki."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
Moon Knight,1,Oscar Isaac is having the time of his life in this Disney+ series that'll disappoint Marvel fans hoping for something a little more like Daredevil
Moon Knight,1,"“Moon Knight,” an adventurous limited series, suggests a way forward for a content-creation engine that’s come to feel overwhelming. There’s a freshness to it that’s enticing even for those outside the fandom."
Moon Knight,1,"It’ll be fun to see how these characters are integrated into the MCU later, but for now nothing’s better than letting “Moon Knight” be its own lunatic thing."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight barely factors into his own story.
Moon Knight,1,"It's thrilling to see Marvel shine a light on the weirder corners of their ever-expanding universe. But Moon Knight is far from perfect. If only Disney had taken more risks, we could be looking at a superhero classic instead of just another good show."
Moon Knight,1,"Its Marvels most psychologically thrilling ambition yet, multiplied. Moon Knight is next level for Marvel fans. And by next level, I mean  maybe not for little ones this time. Sorry, kids."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Moon Knight,1,"Viewers that enjoyed the mind-bending weirdness of WandaVision and Loki could have a lot to look forward to here, provided Moon Knight manages to stick the landing. But even should it stumble, Oscar Isaac's kooky performance is reason enough to tune in."
Moon Knight,1,"Moon Knight is a weird and wonderful blend of archaeological action-adventure and psychological thriller, propelled by a captivating lead performance from Oscar Isaac."
Moon Knight,1,"Four episodes in, Moon Knight is a bonkers blend of action adventure, comedy and horror. And Oscar Isaac is key to bringing it all together. He can really do everything -- even in one single show!"
Moon Knight,1,"Lip service is played to notions of mental illness and traumatically broken humans, but at the end of the day, this is a superhero TV show, and the kind of character depth we crave from must-see TV always feels like its kept at an unsatisfying distance."
Moon Knight,1,"This show, like the rest of us, is just lucky that Oscar Isaac cares enough to try so hard."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac puts Moon Knight on the map in Marvel Studios' most daring TV show yet, ushering in an unmissable new era of storytelling in a series that, if it sticks the landing, could go down as a classic."
Moon Knight,1,"Oscar Isaac proves he is a powerhouse as he literally plays opposite himself perfectly. Horror has made its way to the MCU and YES, this show is brutal, bloody, and bonkers."
The Mandalorian,0,"Where some will be down for the expansion of this story into the larger connected universe, plenty will morn the loss of what was the most unique piece of the on-screen Star Wars universe to date."
The Mandalorian,1,"With its vintage charm and disheveled muppets, The Mandalorian offers something more powerful than reinvention or aesthetic avant-garde: the decadent comfort of the known. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mandalorian,1,"After The Rise Of Skywalker's disappointment, this franchise is finally on an exciting new path. This is the way."
The Mandalorian,1,Dhat Dave Filoni and John Favreau have done with this series... gives new life to the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
The Mandalorian,1,The Mandalorian is a joyous example of how to exist inside a well-worn world with panache. Long may the Force be with it.
The Mandalorian,1,Now I see what all the fuss is about.
The Mandalorian,1,"Aa laboratory for experimentation and recycling and, above all, a firm commitment to the future of the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mandalorian,1,"More consistent than its previous season, it delivers popcorn entertainment out of this world. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Mandalorian,1,An emphatically enjoyable ride.
The Mandalorian,1,"The Mandalorian's second season is not as plot oriented as its predecessor, this is more a ""monster of the week"" kind of season. Lots of fun anyway and wonderfully shot as well."
The Mandalorian,1,"This season features great characters, moments, and episodes that will unite Star Wars fans everywhere."
The Mandalorian,1,"Another solid season in the galaxy far, far away, though that galaxy is starting to feel awfully small."
The Mandalorian,1,"""This is the Way"" is a fitting catch phrase, because The Mandalorian really is the way Star Wars should excite you, surprise you, and keep you wanting more."
The Mandalorian,1,"The inconsistencies of the show are frustrating, but so much is forgiven by how much they nailed the relationship between our central pair."
The Mandalorian,1,"Where Season 1 sometimes struggled to maintain a coherent arc, though, Season 2 has a higher-stakes narrative thrust that builds momentum more effectively."
The Mandalorian,0,"Any attempt to create new characters like Werner Herzog's mysterious Client or Taika Waititi's IG-11 droid are thrown out of the window, with the makers taking the lazier step of filling the world with existing characters."
The Mandalorian,1,"It's no small feat to create a character who is well-rounded and sympathetic, while mostly hidden behind an expressionless mask. But all the credit goes to Pascal for imbuing the man, also known as Din Djarin, with layers of ever-present depth."
The Mandalorian,1,"Aside from just being watchable TV, The Mandalorian season 2's real strength is that it's great Star Wars."
The Mandalorian,1,It has elements of the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy -- as well as the prequel lore -- that I love. It takes the best of both of those worlds.
The Mandalorian,1,"Seeing something you love get such a well crafted, scripted, directed and acted show made it impossible to wipe a smile from my face for hours after watching every episode..."
The Mandalorian,1,"This S2 has been much better argumentatively speaking, going deeper into the characters and with a more linear story. Visually it has been spectacular, with fights and chases worthy of the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mandalorian,1,"If season 1 was about bringing in new fans to the Star Wars galaxy far, far away, then it seemed like The Mandalorian season 2 was about rewarding older fans."
The Mandalorian,1,[The Mandalorian Season 2] feels like it is at a very definitive crossroads.
The Mandalorian,1,"It's Star Wars in its purest form - spare but sprawling, elegantly intimate yet epic in scope, appointment TV at its best."
The Mandalorian,1,"Narratively, this is among the strongest ever tales to bear the Star Wars name, with an ending that leaves you craving more of the same."
The Mandalorian,1,"The Mandalorian feels like Star Wars because Favreau and company, including Clone Wars showrunner Dave Filoni, understand the formula. And it's paying off. In these tense times, the audiences are eating it up like comfort food."
The Mandalorian,1,We're in an age of TV where so much money can be thrown around and it doesn't work. This is throwing a lot of money at something and it does.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"While the series starts strong by leaning on star Temuera Morrison's strong ability and his connection to ingenious storylines, the show ultimately feels more compelled to set up the Star Wars expanded universe then telling a coherent narrative."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"Some simple pleasures transcend questions of good or bad, like watching Boba Fett fight a massive battle droid out of Mass Effect while astride his pet rancor. Or watching a Baby Yoda fling himself at his daddy for a mid-battle hug."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Disney left its content farm out in Tatooines suns for far too long, a wilted mess of a commodity masquerading as a television show. What a sad showing, not just for Star Wars, but for art itself."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,This spaceship feels a bit like it's on autopilot.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett was a series of compounding mistakes. Its best feature was to deliver a Mandalorian sequel that could have been a self-contained film.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett is beyond even an experiment. It should be a bellwether for future writers and producers – because it takes us all for granted.
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"Throughout the series we see an unlikely hero promoting justice in a land that doesnt understand the concept, and the show asks us to consider whether its better to rule through fear or respect."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"While I cant say it was as strong as the previous live action Star Wars series that features so heavily here, I can still say it was thoroughly entertaining every week."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"I just binged it, and a pretty great binge it was."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Favreau scattered story crumbs onto the table and expected hungry viewers to squish them together and call it cake... It's a short-term high, but I believe this business is going destroy this franchise expansion if it's replicated in the spinoffs to come."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,...the interconnectivity of these Star Wars shows continues to prove that the Disney approach to this wonderfully varied property is to make it all feel the same.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The spinoff of 'The Mandalorian' had an opportunity to expand what it meant to be a 'Star Wars' story, but it's consistently stopped right at the edge of actual exploration."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"Another welcome addition to the ""Star Wars"" megaverse."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,Let's hope that the dramatic intensity and action scenes grow in the final four installments.
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"These are essentially pulp stories, and a weekly hour-long series of Boba Fett is a lot of fun because you get to explore his character."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"A quick look at the latest episodic STAR WARS show, this one focusing on an iconic bounty hunter newly tasked with running a crime syndicate:"
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"Popular supporting characters don't often make great spin-off leads, but like the equally mysterious Mandalorian, Fett brings a fresh presence to the Star Wars universe."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,It feels like a big-screen story and it's exciting.
The Book of Boba Fett,1,"Morrison makes a believable tough guy, but the jury's out on whether he can play the sort of charismatic antihero that the show requires."
The Book of Boba Fett,1,What may keep viewers intrigued is the relationship between Boba and Fennec...
Loki,1,"""Tom Hiddleston's growth as Loki in the series was really good..... He's wholeheartedly trusting the process and looking at things from a different lens."""
Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston once again proves why Loki remains the MCU's standout villain, while also holding together a truly masterful multiverse story that hits upon themes of identity and agency that have always felt core to the character."
Loki,1,Loki uses the multiverse to dive deep into its central character and explore interesting moral and philosophical ideas.
Loki,1,"Exuding style and flavor and bolstered by a strong cast, the new Marvel series is still not without some big flaws."
Loki,1,"A second season was announced just prior to the season finale, which did set up a good old cliffhanger of an ending. But right now, the biggest things in the MCU are happening on the small screen, and I'm here for it."
Loki,1,"Loki's first season was a triumph, full of great performances, effects and lots of amusing timeline shenanigans plus a great finale that sets up so much to come in the MCU."
Loki,0,A handful of good ideas lost amid an uninspired narrative.
Loki,0,"Can't have a Multiverse of Madness without introducing the multiverse first, right?"
Loki,1,It's like Marvel meets Brazil and I'm here for it.
Loki,1,"The centrality of the romance in Loki makes it stand out within the MCU-and signals how much potential there is in this kind of storytelling, should Marvel choose to mine it."
Loki,1,One of the smartest decisions Marvel ever made was realizing that Thor was absurd and ought to be a comedy.
Loki,1,"The show delivers on its promise, on fans' expectations, and on its links to the grander MCU canvas."
Loki,1,"The jury is out on Thor's adopted brother, but one thing is for sure- the show about him is so far, very, very good."
Loki,1,"Thanks to its retro-futuristic Mad Men meets Blade Runner vibe [...] and Natalie Holt's theremin-led background score that was wholly distinct from Marvel fare, Loki carved out an identity for itself."
Loki,1,The opening arc of Marvel's latest small-screen adventure doesn't disappoint.
Loki,1,"Right now, the rest of the supporting cast struggles to keep up with them, and there are a million ways its time-travel whodunit plot can go south. But based on what we've seen so far, Loki has the chance to be the best Marvel series yet."
Loki,1,"At least through the first two episodes, it manages to hold its own from a narrative standpoint, deftly blending humor and action with the occasional twist."
Loki,1,[Loki is] shaping up to be one of the weirder and thus more interesting Marvel offerings.
Loki,1,"Halfway through its first season, Loki is proof of concept for what the MCU is trying to achieve with their TV shows..."
Loki,1,"Clever, bold and flat out fascinating, ""Loki"" sets a new bar for Disney+ shows."
Loki,1,This one's going to be good.
Loki,1,An action-packed and surprisingly emotional middle chapter for Loki that does a great job reminding us why we're tuning in.
Loki,1,Definitely another must watch show.
Loki,1,Hiddleston & Wilson continuously steal the show with their chemistry and hilarious banter. Nice to see some new strong female leads in the MCU as well.
Loki,1,"... the stage is set in Loki for an abnormal (in a good way) journey, analyzing the heck out of the Loki character and all his flaws, while adding in new characters that we will either love or hate. Mischief is all but a guarantee."
Loki,1,"This all might be merely preposterous, but life has been breathed into it by the central double act of Hiddleston and Owen Wilson."
Loki,1,"Aside from the acting, this is another Marvel masterclass in design."
Loki,1,"And as long as Hiddleston and Wilson keep at it, ""Loki"" is worth watching, despite its shortcomings."
Loki,1,Hiddleston's performance as Loki has always been defined by its humour as much as its pathos. Both seem to be on display in equal measure in Loki.
Loki,1,"Wilson, now at the peak of his powers, is a real hoot. He's effortlessly perfect as the grizzled old detective type, but he's also deadpan comedy gold, and watching him and Hiddleston play off each other is an unexpected delight."
Loki,1,"WandaVision and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier set the standards as high as Asgard, Loki and his cheeky little persona has come along to raise that bar even higher with yet another fresh and original start that see's him toying with his own conscience."
Loki,1,"Intriguing comedic/fantasy sci-fi series, featuring conniving Loki, the Norse God of Mischief."
Loki,1,"There is a clear balance on the normal and exaggeration (Hiddleston feels very comfortable handling that tone), but Loki is not a completely surprising and successful series for now. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Loki,1,"Because Loki is the most fun MCU character, the potential here is Marvel-ous. Lotsa complex exposition at the top but the potential for comic-licous atmosphere is apparent."
Loki,1,I've seen the first two episodes so far and Loki should please Marvel fans. Tom Hiddleston is in prime form as our title character.
Loki,1,"It kept the punchiness and the fun and the cool nature of Marvel, and it also opens up the universe to incredible potential and seeds the later stories."
Loki,1,"Loki [has] an offbeat, fun, scenario that fits rather well with star Tom Hiddleston's ability to make such a sly and occasionally morally repugnant character so ingratiating."
Loki,1,"Loki will hit the spot for Marvel fans waiting for the next batch of theatrical releases, but it's also not stale and proves that being a franchise doesn't have to mean limiting real creativity."
Loki,1,"Hiddleston is in full show-off mode yet again, effortlessly swinging between grandiose egomaniac and scared little boy with the intelligent comic timing that made us fall in love with him the very first time he donned the horns."
Loki,1,"The great thing about it is that the Marvel comic book universe is endless and unstoppable, and ancient rules seem carved in stone, but things can change on a dime; that's a huge part of the fun."
Loki,1,The new Marvel series combines the inventiveness of WandaVision with the buddy-comedy repartee missing from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.
Loki,1,"With LOKI, the MCU seems to be going for THE ODD COUPLE by way of ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND...as much character study as a dissertation on society. It's hardly kids' stuff."
Loki,1,"The new MCU series is a time traveling crime thriller. The first two episodes are heavy on the exposition between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston, and light on the action but it is full of intrigue with a set up that'll keep viewers tuned in."
Loki,1,The first episode was a wild ride of its own and I can't wait to see where Waldron and Herron will take us in the coming weeks. WATCH THIS NOW.
Loki,1,There is enough spark in the beginning to inspire us to take time with the God of Mischief.
Loki,1,"The blessing of Loki is that there's no reason to believe Mobius is actually right. He may not even believe what he's saying. As a way to manipulate a master manipulator, telling Loki he's incapable of change or success is a brilliant stroke."
Loki,1,"The show's creator, Michael Waldron, and director, Kate Herron, have laid out a rather elegant framework for their plans."
Loki,1,"The overall vibe of Loki is, like WandaVision, more off the beaten Marvel path. Both the MCU as a whole and this individual series are the better for it."
Loki,1,"This delightful, thoughtful addition to the MCU brings all the quirky fun and humor of Thor: Ragnarok while deftly exploring some pretty big questions about existence and free will."
Loki,1,"[Loki] exists almost expressly as fan service, offering its elbow to safely walk us across this bridge in the franchise. It's a handsome escort, certainly. But I do wonder how long it can hold up its end of a deeper conversation."
Loki,1,"Loki, in drawing inspiration not from the established MCU method but from the looser narratives of comic books, feels like a refreshing reset for the franchise."
Loki,1,"The heavy influences don't weigh down the narrative but unexpectedly gives the comic genre a refreshing, although borrowed, prefab architectural playground to play on, especially when things take an Escher-ial turn."
Loki,1,"Plenty to love in this series so far, it's delightfully kooky which helps averts the superhero fatigue. Tom Hiddleston relishes in being an anti-hero, and this series gives him a chance to show the many sides of Loki in such a fun way."
Loki,1,"Looks like it's going to be a fun show, whether you're an MCU fanatic or not."
Loki,1,The MCU is back and Loki is another excellent addition to the Disney Plus roster.
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Loki,0,"The series achieves its ultimate manifestation as Saturday-afternoon animation. With Loki, Marvel, Disney, and their die-hard constituents have found ways to make the banal even more banal."
Loki,1,"Loki is a fun, weird, occasionally awkward shift away from the Marvel cinematic aesthetic that gives one of its central and most popular players room to be both exactly what we expect him to be and also the space to be something more than we've seen."
Loki,1,"Like the big-screen Avengers movies before it, Loki is the perfect distillation of everything Marvel has been working toward -- just slightly smaller and less godlike. Sort of like Loki."
Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy."
Loki,1,"If Loki leans more enthusiastically into the time-hopping adventure aspect, as it surely must, I'm sure viewers will begin to have almost as good a time as Hiddleston and Wilson clearly are."
Loki,1,"Let's hope that the balance between talk and action improves, and that Waldron finds more to do for Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Wunmi Mosaku, who have so far been wasted as a TVA judge and hunter respectively."
Loki,1,"The first two episodes involve Mobius convincing Loki to pitch in - giving Wilson and star Tom Hiddleston time to develop a quirky, cantankerous chemistry a la Men in Black's Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones."
Loki,1,"The fan-favorite gets to be the protagonist -you could argue he already did it in all of the Thor movies. The show is part workplace buddy comedy, part time-travel adventure and part procedural crime investigation, with a side of Marvel superhero panache."
Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston has always been reasonably magnetic as Loki, but he has nothing on Wilson's incredible charismatic chill."
Loki,1,"If anything, it's a little too easy, and as the star rather than a supporting player, Hiddleston can sometimes appear to be coasting through the so-so material."
Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston comfortable in the skin of the Asgardian but not allowing overconfidence, achieving that difficult mix between Machiavellian and charismatic, managing to feel both familiar and different simultaneously. [Full review in Spanish]"
Loki,1,Tom Hiddleston feels like the perfect guide to lead us through some wild and wacky adventures.
Loki,1,"The real hook of Loki, however, is the god of mischief's interplay with co-star Owen Wilson as the charismatic Mobius, a TVA bureaucrat who's hunting a time-jumping agent of chaos running loose all over the multiverse."
Loki,1,It's that kind of easy banter which makes Loki everything Marvel fans hoped for - and a winning watch.
Loki,1,Some of my favorite moments of the first two episodes were just Loki and Mobius shooting the breeze about fate and other cosmic matters in the TVA cafeteria.
Loki,1,"Loki tells audiences exactly what it is, what it's going to do, and confirms that the fan love of its title character wasn't just because of his beautiful hair...He can carry the spotlight with glorious purpose and I'm going to keep tuning in."
Loki,1,"It's a strange episode of television, even borderline absurdist, but of course, as things get interesting, it has to do some MCU homework that grind things to a halt."
Loki,1,"Entertaining, sporadically funny, and takes some interestingly trippy turns. It reminds us why Loki the mocker made the Thor movies fun to watch."
Loki,1,"Tom Hiddleston returns in the role he was born to play. He and Owen Wilson, hilarious as agent Mobius, are Marvel's new dream team in a series that has it all. In a word, wow!"
Loki,1,"Terrifically entertaining, tantalisingly mysterious, and beautifully crafted."
Loki,1,A stupendous series that leaps over Wandavision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. [Full Review in Spanish]
Loki,1,"""WandaVision"" and ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" had major success earlier this year, but I could argue ""Loki"" is more interesting. An emotional character study that presents Loki with his biggest obstacle yet: himself."
Loki,1,"With glorious purpose, not to mention eye-popping production design and a playful chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson, Loki is an ambitious, stylish and engaging series that expands the narrative universe to the next-next-next level."
Loki,1,[Loki] dares to expand the walls of the MCU beyond what's known to give us a closer look at its cosmic underpinnings.
Loki,1,"If you're here for the Douglas Adams-ish satire, it's some of the most fun stuff in the MCU."
Loki,1,"Loki takes advantage of long form storytelling to do something deeper and more surprising than its big screen brothers, but it does so without undermining the expectations Marvel has spent more than a decade building."
Loki,1,"So wonderfully seamless with the rest of the MCU, while carving out a unique space for Loki to thrive on his own; while exploring more of his identity."
Loki,1,"In a different timeline, Loki would have made for an excellent Christopher Nolan movie. But in the timeline that you and I share, it's an exciting and genuinely inspired addition to Marvel storytelling."
Loki,1,"Through Hiddleston's nuanced performance, we get to see Loki's quirks and qualities laid bare at last-depths of character that have only been hinted at."
Loki,1,Loki works because the filmmakers and cast click perfectly and give us a series that tells a story we have never seen before.
Loki,1,"Thankfully, Hiddleston does what he does best and that is to embody the Norse God to perfection."
Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so."
Loki,1,"Mobius and Loki make for an effective odd couple, with the ""full-tilt diva"", as Tony Stark put it in Avengers Assemble, butting up against the unruffled, surfer-dude energy of Wilson's agent."
Loki,1,"Hiddleston's deep, purring voice and Shakespearean training also do wonders for Loki's melodramatic speeches, flourishing in this new Disney+ miniseries. The rest of the show, however, is less impressive."
Loki,1,"The breezy attitude seems right for the show's scant six episodes, which will roll out on Wednesdays. He may be the God of mischief and a mass murderer but Loki knows how to show you a good time."
Loki,1,"The devil is in the details of ""Loki,"" but we promise you that devil is not Mephisto."
Loki,1,"Hiddleston seamlessly slides back into the Asgardian God role as the annoying, obnoxious adopted brother of Thor."
Loki,1,"Further proof that when Marvel colour outside the intended lines, they manage their own canvas that's just as attractive and infinitely more interesting."
Loki,1,"Marvel has another hit! Loki is smart and witty. A self-proclaimed ""mischievous scamp,"" we love to see what trouble Loki finds next."
Loki,1,"The Beetlejuice-like atmosphere and wildly creative details of the TVA are hugely appealing, as is how the exploration of time will challenge Loki to assess/reassess his actions."
Loki,1,"Balancing the standard Marvel comedy with strong character beats and heart-tugging moments, Loki is a well-balanced series that never once takes itself too seriously."
Loki,1,"With an entertaining mystery wrapped in a time travelling adventure, paired with expansive world building and creative productionLoki is off to a strong start."
Loki,1,You're going to have to pay close attention to know what the hell is going on in this colorfully convoluted world that is Loki the TV series.
Loki,1,"The most cinematic Marvel show to date in large part thanks to Hiddleston & Wilson. Very strong across the board. A bit slow in parts, but overall top notch entertainment."
Loki,1,"The god of mischief is back! Time is on Loki's side with charm, humor and a dash of humanity. Easily the best Marvel series to date."
Loki,1,"If you're a fan of the power of conversation akin to an Aaron Sorkin work, you're going to love 'Loki.' You'll adjust to its pace and will be excited by its detective mystery. Owen Wilson [is] perfectly cast!"
Loki,1,"Loki has a lot of potential, but in the first two episodes at least, a sluggish narrative and four phases worth of back story weigh things down more than we'd like."
Loki,0,It's nevertheless a bit of a letdown when you realize halfway through the dense first episode that one of the MCU's ostensibly most unpredictable lead characters has somehow landed in the most predictable of setups.
Loki,1,"Loki can get bogged down in its discussion of timelines and multiverses... but thankfully the creative team keeps the narrative engine humming, filling the screen with eye-catching details."
Loki,1,"The set design for Loki is top-notch, evoking Terry Gilliam's Brazil with its art deco depiction of the TVA's base of operations, while nifty visual effects are employed to keep Loki ""chained up"" and to dispatch agents to time period after time period."
Loki,1,"The episodic nature of the series gives the story time to breathe, and Loki and Mobius spend a lot of scenes just sitting in chairs and talking. And it's never boring!"
Loki,1,"The TVA's inclusion in this series is a stroke of genius, creating an apparatus to excises Loki from the main MCU while also creating a vast fantasy/sci-fi playground of all time and space for Hiddleston to play in."
Loki,1,"""Loki '' really is really just a character study of one particularly complex and - as Loki fans will attest - fun character. Moreover, a second season has been ordered, so the potential for ""variant"" timelines - and do-overs - multiply from there."
Loki,1,"The chemistry between Wilson and Hiddleston is great, with the pair able to seamlessly transition from throwing barbs to contemplating serious revelations."
Loki,1,"Perhaps in its greatest accomplishment, Loki has now changed my perspective on Wilson - for the better!"
Loki,1,"A lot of rigamarole, a lot of time travel jargon and an entirely new science fiction side of the [MCU], but at the very least it succeeds as a showcase for Hiddleston's mischievous smile. It also might give Disney+ its first genuinely good Marvel series"
Loki,1,"The first two episodes of Loki are extremely exciting and this has the potential to be the best of the MCU spin-off shows from 2021. Let's hope it continues to be weird, dystopian and gorgeous to look at."
Loki,1,"Loki is a genre-defying series that is at once bizarre, funny, thrilling and did I say weird already?"
Loki,1,"Much like Loki himself, I suspect the Loki series is a trickster. It is setting us up ever so slowly in order to double-cross us with irresistible mischief."
Loki,1,Loki is a lot of fun and takes us on a thrilling sense of adventure while keeping the Marvel spirit in tone.
Loki,1,"Marvel has created a vastly different series. Hiddleston thrives, and Wilson owns this role. It may end up being Marvel's best show yet."
Loki,1,"Part workplace comedy, part time-travelling epic, Marvel Studios' latest series is a great showcase for the collective charm of Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson."
Loki,1,"With Hiddleston's assured performance at the center, ﻿Loki﻿ gets off to a promising start with a twisty mystery and fascinating world-building."
Loki,1,"It thankfully seems to be dodging everything that went wrong with The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, and right now, that's good enough."
Loki,1,"""Loki"" is a great-looking, well-paced, original piece that's equal parts workplace comedy, time-hopping adventure, murder mystery and superhero fantasy."
Loki,1,The key to Loki-both the character and the show-is always Tom Hiddleston.
Loki,1,"The approach is bold, the pacing is brisk, and the mix of humor within the narrative is perfectly balanced."
Loki,1,"The wit and wackiness on display here is tempered by life-and-death stakes, as early on a clear mystery of sorts is established, offering up just a touch of a classic procedural format to help ground the action."
Loki,1,"After two episodes, Loki is at a tipping point. Having set everything up to an exhausting degree, things could be lined up to get really entertaining."
Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole."
Loki,1,"A longtime favorite of MCU fans, Hiddleston has never been better as the God of Mischief, savoring every arrogant syllable of his (frequent) soliloquys, while also being given more opportunity than ever before to explore the character's nature."
Loki,1,"Nothing can prepare you for Loki, a mind-bending dive into the Marvel Multiverse that takes everything you thought you knew about the MCU and turns it on its head for one of the most ambitious, craziest stories Marvel Studios has ever told."
Loki,1,God bless Owen Wilson.
Loki,1,"Loki and Hiddleston - in all their many colors - are fun enough to bring one back to the stream to catch each new episode to see what that ""scamp"" is up to now."
WandaVision,0,"The first three-ish episodes were very fun, and then it pretty quickly turned into a long Marvel movie."
WandaVision,1,The costumer and set designers did a great job of capturing these eras without feeling obvious or kitschy.
WandaVision,1,"Addressing pandemic-induced topics such as loss, grief, and mental illness, Marvel's WandaVision serves as a metaphor for life in the time of COVID."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision has kicked the door wide open for Phase Four of the MCU, with stand-out performances and outstanding thematic storytelling"
WandaVision,1,"Elizabeth Olsen is a powerhouse, it require guts to start the MCU television history with a sitcom mashup. Marvel took their best female character and developed the hell out of it. Amazing show. [Full review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,"The respect for old sitcoms is seen in the loving reimagining of classic sets, giving the superheroes a lot of space to send plates flying through the air, or to find live storks wandering around the living room."
WandaVision,1,"My immediate reaction was that it's a charming, exquisitely done, pointless confection."
WandaVision,1,"The new series set after the events of Avengers: Endgame is the most unexpected, fascinating project Marvel Studios has brought to the screen so far."
WandaVision,1,"At this point, if you STILL need me to explain why this show is good..."
WandaVision,0,WandaVision doesn't grasp gender or racial representation as well as it thinks it does.
WandaVision,1,The first major Marvel Studios project to release onto the new mega streaming service Disney+ fulfilled big expectations and then some.

WandaVision,1,An enchantingly entertaining start to Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is doing a great job of expanding the magical world of this fictional universe.
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is a welcome return to watercooler TV.
WandaVision,1,"At some point, I'll likely take in ""WandaVision"" in a single sitting to see how it holds up, but it's fair to call it the best six-hour film of the year."
WandaVision,1,A game of duplicity... without abandoning the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,"The action, emotions, and drama all make this a must-see show, and Wandavision has rightfully been praised for its strong themes related to grief, love, and family."
WandaVision,1,A Marvel Studios' masterstroke consumed by fandom's hype.
WandaVision,0,"Despite its laugh tracks and various winks and nods, the Marvel superhero series is lacking in its homage to iconic television."
WandaVision,1,Marvel and Disney raise the bar for the mini-series VOD world. By far the best thing I have ever seen on an episodic series. Even if it rips my heart out once again.
WandaVision,1,Marrying spectacle and emotion for a show that does credit to both its format and its franchise.
WandaVision,1,A mind-bending illusion of TV sitcoms of the past all wrapped up as a gift of intriguing mystery.
WandaVision,1,Wandavision is a fresh look at MCU formats and superhero stories. Wandavision is an easy entry point for newbs to this multiverse. There are more than enough Easter eggs to appease the best long-term fans.
WandaVision,1,"What could've been a schmaltzy, sappy mess blew my expectations out of the water, by presenting an accurate representation of the isolating, all-consuming nature of grief."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision scratches the big-budget superhero itch we've had for a while. Its sharp and character rich writing and exhilarating action exemplifies everything the MCU does right, but it also suffers from similar weaknesses as other entries."
WandaVision,1,"Wandavision takes quite a few risks pushing the MCU envelope with mixed results. Excessive fan service, underdeveloped villain(s) and character motivation. Intriguing to see which way the trend may go after this."
WandaVision,1,Disney's first MCU series avoids an on-the-nose approach to depicting a woman with superpowers-something other franchises in the genre have long struggled to do...
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision gave both the actress and the franchise a chance to finally create a true ""origin story"" for her superhero persona, The Scarlet Witch, with deeply satisfying results."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision was a triumph, a great mix of humour and mystery that kept you excitedly guessing what things meant and where they were going each week. Highly Recommended."
WandaVision,1,"I've really enjoyed Wandavision, a series with which Disney makes it clear (if it didn't already with The Mandalorian) that Disney+ original content will be just incredible [Full review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,A very compelling mystery.
WandaVision,1,"Olsen is terrific in the lead, but what really keeps things interesting is supporting turns by Teyonah Parris and especially Kathryn Hahn as a nosy, witchy neighbor..."
WandaVision,1,"As an ode to television history, a superhero origin story, and the launch pad for an even bigger cinematic universe, the series works. But, ultimately, what is WandaVision, if not a show about grief?"
WandaVision,1,"It's unlikely that this show, with this focus, could ever have been successful without Elizabeth Olsen's indelible central performance."
WandaVision,0,WandaVision is best when it embraces the idiosyncrasies that made it distinct; the show loses that flourish when it's focused on spinning six different MCU plates all at once.
WandaVision,1,"An ingenious trip to the past from a modern vision, under a facade that conceals a fascinating Marvel Universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,"I've had fun with it, and I like going with it along the way, rather than rushing through it all at once...worth watching..."
WandaVision,0,"I do want movies and TV to do the basic work of winning me over and establishing the stakes, and I chafe when a relationship is described rather than shown."
WandaVision,1,"Depending on how you look at it, WandaVision - set after the events of 2019's epic Avengers: Endgame - falls somewhere between an homage to classic sitcoms and a sitcom itself. It's often fun and clever, as well as increasingly mysterious."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision takes big risks, delivering us something unique and different that we haven't seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe before."
WandaVision,1,This is some next level TV experience right now as WandaVision is completely reshaping expectations for what's possible in the MCU.
WandaVision,1,A bold and intriguing start to a show where Marvel Studios finally tunes into its weirdest frequency. [Full Review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,"With no fight scenes and no special effects, so far at least, this isn't a show about saving the world. It's about building a family. Which, in its own way, amounts to the same thing."
WandaVision,1,Oddness reigns in WandaVision in the best way possible.
WandaVision,1,"Inspired and creative, WandaVision upends the tried-and-true Marvel formula by combining loving -- and at times wacky -- homage with some disturbingly sinister undertones."
WandaVision,0,"Disney Plus's new Marvel show WandaVision promises a surreal spin on a 1960s sitcom reality. But so far, it's delivered little more than winks and nods to Marvel Cinematic Universe loyalists."
WandaVision,1,"There are a couple of genuinely surreal, even creepy moments. One dinner table scene from the first episode actually gives off strong Lynchian vibes, calling to mind the filmmaker's bizarre 1977 debut, Eraserhead."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision feels like a vindication for my fandom. At last, two of my most beloved MCU characters, who only ever got teeny-tiny scenes in bigger, more grandiose stories, have a show of their own."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is solid television, albeit not the kind of fare that's well designed to live up to unsustainable hype."
WandaVision,1,"... a cheeky, reference-laden and genuinely strange and delightful show that challenges the audience"
WandaVision,0,You'll have to wade through a middling '60s sitcom to see what's really going down on Marvel's unconventional WandaVision.
WandaVision,0,"I'm like, where you going with this?"
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is hopefully a chance to allow more unique ways to tell these stories that dominate our media culture.
WandaVision,1,"Appreciate it for its quirky, dead-on homage to American television's sitcom roots, but prepare for something altogether different. Enjoy the ride."
WandaVision,0,"Based on the first three episodes, 'Wanda Vision' does not deliver the unique entertainment one might expect. However there are indications there may be a brighter future."
WandaVision,1,"Scary, surreal visuals in quirky superhero mystery show."
WandaVision,1,"The biggest question with any mystery tale is: Can the big reveal stick the landing? But until that crash into reality, it's going to be a fun ride sleuthing."
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
WandaVision,1,"All good things come to those who wait, and the Marvel Universe has always been as much about character and story-build as relentless fighting, and WandaVision shows that there's still more to be found in its almost bottomless bag."
WandaVision,1,"She's not the first superhero to be affected acutely by emotional pain; everyone knows that quote about great power and great responsibility. Yet for an MCU project, the choice to focus on Wanda's inner life is revolutionary."
WandaVision,1,"It'll be intriguing for super fans curious about what the point is and how it might connect to the larger franchise, and it will be intriguing to those who might feel a little burned out on superheroes."
WandaVision,1,Deliciously disorienting.
WandaVision,1,An enjoyable episode overall.
WandaVision,1,It just felt delightful.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision launches a potential new ""forever"" paradigm in entertainment. Disney and Feige are creating something that is brand new, even if they are using nostalgia."
WandaVision,1,The series trades Marvel's typically dire stakes and intergalactic scale for lighthearted intimacy.
WandaVision,1,"Altho the TV takeoffs are satires of satires, forces are infiltrating the scene, & all will want to see what happens next. The joy of the MCU is this type of uber-creativity."
WandaVision,1,Part of WandaVision's strength is that it would work just fine as an absolutely straight-up sitcom.
WandaVision,1,"One does not, in this case, invoke either the specter [of David Lynch] lightly... Obviously, that doesn't mean that WandaVision is somehow 'MarvelHolland Drive' - but it also doesn't not mean that."
WandaVision,0,"As the show goes on and starts coming into focus, maybe it'll hit the vibe of that twisted Twilight Zone reality I think they might be going for here. But for my money, I think they should have hit that in the first couple episodes."
WandaVision,1,"...for those willing to wait, showrunner Jac Schaeffer seems to be slowly building up the mystery, laying the foundation for the series by fully immersing it into the sitcom world that has become Wanda and Vision's new reality..."
WandaVision,1,"MarvelVision isn't just some one-off experiment. It's the future of the MCU. At least, fans can hope."
WandaVision,1,"For the first time in a long, long time, I have no idea what to expect from a Marvel thing, and that's a nice surprise."
WandaVision,1,A daring sharp right turn for Marvel...
WandaVision,1,"If you're one of those Marvel Cinematic Universe fans who feel it's time for something truly unique and different: Meet ""Wandavision."""
WandaVision,1,"A disorienting tribute to TV sitcoms and, ultimately, a delightfully weird launching pad for Marvel's next era."
WandaVision,1,"Based on these two episodes, there's enough reason to be optimistic that WandaVision might just be genuinely weird enough."
WandaVision,1,"This is soaring, original unreality worth seeing through to the finale, be it bitter or sitcom sweet."
WandaVision,1,"At the very least, WandaVision delivers a fun ramble through sitcom history, with the added benefit that you haven't already seen each episode a dozen times in reruns. If that's all there is, it might even be enough. But expect more."
WandaVision,1,"A strange escapist fantasy that is unexpectedly delightful. One moment you're thinking, what am I watching? And the next, you're hooked."
WandaVision,1,"At the edges of WandaVision's simple pleasures lurks the extended MCU, clouding the best moments of the first hour with more than a little foreboding it's all not going to last."
WandaVision,1,"If this is the next stage in the MCU, it's a refreshing and unusual path."
WandaVision,0,"Despite some fun performances, Stark Industries cameos, and a hefty homage to past generations of television, it's tiresome... Slightly confounding expectations become the quicksand here."
WandaVision,1,"Nostalgic, fun, and intriguing all at once, it's a successful mix of two genres that no one would have ever thought to put together."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is playing the long game and one can only hope that the big picture will be more interesting than its visually appealing but only fitfully satisfying component parts.
WandaVision,1,"...a unique and unorthodox entry in the Marvel Universe...this is an ambitious and experimental series that, should it nail its big reveal(s) down the line, could portend a brave new direction for future superhero adventures."
WandaVision,1,"Through clever re-creations of sitcom theme songs, sets and tropes, WandaVision proves a unique entry in a genre that's too often overly similar."
WandaVision,1,"To WandaVision's immense credit, director Matt Shakman doesn't just use the classic sitcom as a backdrop or a mere stop on the way to the presumed pyrotechnics and superheroics to come; he dives all the way into it."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is interesting and probably worth a look for now, though that may change if the elaborate setup doesn't start to pay off before too long."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a fun new look at the MCU. For so long, we saw them stick their toes in the world of exploring genre, and this show feels like diving in head first, and I'm beyond excited to see where the show goes."
WandaVision,1,"It's all deliciously, confidently, stylishly done. The parodies are fantastic fun, the jokes are great, the performances (especially from Olsen and Bettany, whose chemistry is a joy in itself) are wonderful."
WandaVision,1,Matt Shakman's program reaches its own affable frequency amongst its big-screen peers.
WandaVision,1,"This is such a departure for Marvel Studios that it may take a few episodes to settle into the excruciatingly slow pace of this unique, funny, weird trip into sitcom TV History."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision's commitment to confounding expectations might offer something few franchises as hoary as this one ever do - a fresh, surprising way in."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision has landed and it's a blast!
WandaVision,1,"Fresh, original, strange, tragic, intriguing, 'WandaVision' stands in bold contrast to Marvel's previous output. That alone makes it worth watching."
WandaVision,1,Magnetic... a great metaphor for how a series seeks to forever modify the consumption of superheroes on TV today. [Full review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,"It is creating the space for unexpected versions of these characters, as well as giving talented actors the room to truly stretch themselves outside of the crowded cast lists of the movies."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is Marvel's first new offering since Martin Scorsese compared Marvel movies to theme parks and complained they didn't constitute ""cinema"", and the new Marvel series seems like a direct response to those remarks."
WandaVision,1,"Even with its slow start, the latest from the MCU is a much-needed surreal makeover for the brand."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision may not grab the attention of viewers right out the gate, but trust me, give it time."
WandaVision,1,"This first series (from the MCU) is terrific, startling in the bold risks it takes, and one that will leave you breathlessly wondering where this crazy show is going."
WandaVision,0,"The classic-comedy pastiche is skillful, affectionate and well-performed, but it's not terribly imaginative - if anything, it's a little too true to its antiquated sources. It's also not very funny."
WandaVision,1,"It's a bonkers concept that makes for a wonderful homage to iconic television, while expanding the MCU in a fresh way."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is an extremely effective expansion of a huge intellectual property franchise to TV, a project that erases some of the lingering distinctions between TV and film even as its buffs them."
WandaVision,1,Homage in the best sense.
WandaVision,1,"I loved WandaVision, it's weird, funny, confusing, magical, and mysterious, taking advantage of its TV format to tell a story without hurry, dancing to the rhythm of its own drum. [Full review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,"Bettany and Olsen have a sweet chemistry. It's refreshing to see the actors at play in a field that doesn't require them to send some super foe (or friend, the way the Avengers get on) backward through a brick wall."
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
WandaVision,1,"Part 'Pleasantville,' part 'The Truman Show' with a sinister splash of David Lynch subversive, surrealist mystery, 'WandaVision' is one of the most unique Marvel properties to date."
WandaVision,1,"It's hard to not be a little let down by the decompressed approach at its inception...still, I'm intrigued enough to want to know more."
WandaVision,1,"So weirdly different from what we've come to expect from Marvel, that it might serve as a gateway drug for people who've steadfastly resisted the super-hero genre thus far."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision shows that Marvel still has the power to surprise us and proves we can expect big, weird things from Phase 4. [Full review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is a solid introduction for the MCU to Disney+ because it does not try to be a feature film but an event series that explores a very specific facet of the larger cinematic universe.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a bold series and very different from what we've previously seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And just like Thor: Ragnarok, it's a feeling that this universe needs. [Full Review in Spanish]"
WandaVision,1,The best part about the new Marvel Universe series WandaVision is also undoubtedly the source of its biggest frustration.
WandaVision,1,Quirky might be the best word to describe what I've seen of WandaVision so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is a unique departure from the tried and true MCU formula. The series allows Marvel to take their characters out of the box and try dynamic things with them. Elizabeth Olsen shines
WandaVision,1,"Whatever it is, ""WandaVision"" is the weirdest entry yet into the MCU, and a significant artistic step forward in its storytelling."
WandaVision,1,"'WandaVision' sees bright moments, but ambition is often overshadowed by frustration."
WandaVision,1,"Brimming with assurance, the television series is a concoction of risk that pays off."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision may not have been Marvel's first choice to launch their new slate of Disney+ shows - but it's certainly more than enough to raise excitement about the future.
WandaVision,1,I certainly look forward to finding out what direction the show takes. But it's clearly going to take some time getting there.
WandaVision,1,Its mystery box presentation is a delightful showcase for Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen's obvious chemistry and the costume department's limitless budget.
WandaVision,1,"Oddly, by going into the past, WandaVision has created television that is fresh and different."
WandaVision,1,What the two lead actors-and the rest of WandaVision's cast-are doing instead is genuinely bringing their characters to life in modes fitting a variety of vintage television shows.
WandaVision,1,"While this won't be for everyone due to the slow-burn pacing and departure from the usual formula, WandaVision signals a bold and exciting direction for Marvel."
WandaVision,1,A highly unique and entertaining pivot for the MCU. A delightful sitcom showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany with a curious and somewhat chilling mystery afoot.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision's core conceit-that sometimes you just want to escape into television, into fantasy, into a daydream-couldn't be more meta. Let's stay here in this happiness just a little while longer. The world outside is so dark."
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a wholly unique, wonderfully mesmerizing, and wildly entertaining Marvel adventure; an absolute winner for the MCU with a phenomenal performance from Elizabeth Olsen."
WandaVision,1,"It feels simultaneously wildly experimental and weighed down by its high concept. But one thing is certain after viewing three episodes made available for review: More are needed to figure out what ""WandaVision"" actually is."
WandaVision,1,"What I think WandaVision does the most right, and what will carry the show, is let an incredible ensemble of actors sink their teeth into different genres and acting styles."
WandaVision,1,"With performances like those delivering scripts this tight, surrounded by period-accurate sets, lighting, effects, credits, costumes, etc., WandaVision is itself a masterclass in sitcom history."
WandaVision,1,"It's hard to find fault in the construction of WandaVision, at least not after three episodes."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is a welcome return for the MCU that gets its next phase off on unexpected footing but pays off both in entertainment value and the promise of developments to come.
WandaVision,1,"You don't need to remember every tiny detail of the previous films, but Easter eggs and lore are there if you really want to look closer."
WandaVision,1,It's brilliant once you've thought it over. These allusions to classic comfort food TV make us believe someone's mind might be breaking... But who? Where exactly are they? And why does all this quirky perfection make us so uncomfortable?
WandaVision,1,"If WandaVision is any indication of what's to come, then we are in for a treat. The future of Marvel has never looked better and it's great to have some of our favourite heroes back."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is tremendously entertaining, weird, fun, and dark -- which is enough to warrant audiences coming back for more, Marvel fans or not."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
WandaVision,1,Olsen and Bettany bring impressively era-appropriate physicality to their roles in a way that also anchors the otherwise bizarre narrative in the familiar.
WandaVision,1,"The feel and tone of the show is a bold choice, but one that absolutely pays off."
WandaVision,1,"While the one-liners themselves sometimes leave a little to be desired, Olsen and Bettany do a terrific job tailoring their performances as Wanda and Vision to match the aesthetics of 1950s and '60s multi-camera productions."
WandaVision,1,"The result wields more of a scalpel than a hammer, wryly celebrating the history of television while slowly, very slowly, pulling the viewer into an enticing ""The Twilight Zone""-esque mystery."
WandaVision,0,"While it's far too early to assess the nine-episode, $150 million gamble fully, so far it's interestingly bad."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is clever, delightful, and a fun Marvel mystery to unravel. Worth the wait and a welcome start to Phase 4. Parents Guide."
WandaVision,1,"The two leads are surrounded by a strong cast that includes Kathryn Hahn as Agnes, the neighbor who's up in everyone's business and delivers her lines as if they're sliding out the side of her mouth. She's perfect."
WandaVision,1,"Slow build & stranger than Dr. Strange, but the chemistry between Bettany and Olson, & ambitious original sitcom will have you utterly Scarlet Be-witched. It's the weird reality TV escape we didn't know we needed in 2021."
WandaVision,1,The first three episodes are all set up with a ton of metatext on sitcoms with two underserved Avengers. Not enough to judge yet.
WandaVision,1,"I'd say stay tuned. But I feel that is just what Disney might want me to do. Dang superheroes. They've saved the day once again, at least for now."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is unlike anything that the MCU has ever done.
WandaVision,1,What WandaVision truly is though - is a Marvel. A highly addictive slice of engrossing escapism that's also a wonderful celebration of television itself.
WandaVision,1,"If the show gets more intriguing with each episode, its easter eggs and character teases and references to HYDRA also become harder for a casual MCU viewer to parse."
WandaVision,1,"It's great TV on its own merits. But for those who relish these stories but always want them to reach further, WandaVision is a true triumph."
WandaVision,1,Consider WandaVision an unusual first step for this new Marvel phase. The best parts lovingly conjure the mood of very old television shows. The worst parts feel like just another movie.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision also excels as a visual history of the TV comedy, transitioning to the bright candy colors of the 1970s by the third episode (the last available for review) as the comical complications of their dislocated domesticity grow."
WandaVision,1,"That said, the show does a great job of reintroducing fans into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it sets the table nicely for any new fans to the superhero genre who are just interested in a new series (even if you're not interested in superhero films)."
WandaVision,1,"While a slow burn on the mystery could be disappointing, WandaVision is likely to remain highly watchable thanks to its titular duo. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are an absolute joy, and effortlessly emulate the performance styles of yesteryear."
WandaVision,1,"At times, some of the jokes felt like they were only for me. So if you, like me, are a fan of classic situational comedies, well you are in for a treat. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I literally have no idea how you will react to WandaVision"
WandaVision,1,As a loving pastiche of creaky American sitcoms WandaVision is endearing. And Olsen and Bettany are clearly having a hoot in their retro frocks and dad sweaters. But it's that rising dread that will bring Marvel fans scrambling back for more.
WandaVision,1,"With a clear affection for its corny inspirations, WandaVision manages to avoid the easy punchline."
WandaVision,1,WandaVision is the Marvel Cinematic Universe sitcom we need right now but the series is a true love letter to television history in general.
WandaVision,1,It's rare to encounter a TV show that remains enjoyable in spite of how little information it gives the audience.
WandaVision,1,"It's enjoying itself as a sincerely respectful homage to the sitcom format, whilst offering [Elizabeth] Olsen and especially [Paul] Bettany the rare chance to flex their comedic muscle in the most joyous fashion possible."
WandaVision,1,"If WandaVision is a bellwether for the level of experimentation and creativity we can expect from [Disney+'s MCU shows], we might not be in the worst hands."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is tapping into a power that the MCU has been sitting on for a decade, and like Wanda ripping Thanos apart in Endgame, it's about time we see what this thing can really do."
WandaVision,1,WandVision works best precisely because it is unlike anything the MCU's model has ever produced before.
WandaVision,1,"If you were looking for charming stars to convey a Mary Tyler Moore/Dick Van Dyke vibe, you couldn't do much better as Olsen and Bettany get to spell out the sweet chemistry that the movies have only hinted at."
WandaVision,0,"Once WandaVision starts recycling the same content in each episode, it becomes difficult to ignore that the show's primary interest is playing with form rather than propelling its story forward."
WandaVision,1,"There are enough precarious moments in each ""WandaVision"" episode that make it clear the show might not work at all, in fact, without a nuanced actor like Olsen tethering it to some kind of reality."
WandaVision,1,"""A Marvel deep-dive into America's treasure chest of telly treats"""
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is WandaVision, and if you can watch it for what it is, it's satisfying television."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision﻿ is an entertaining debut for the MCU on Disney+, balancing its comedic influences with tantalizing teases of a larger mystery."
WandaVision,1,"As expected, the production values are excellent, and the writing is solid, even cheeky at moments, and witty."
WandaVision,1,"Unabashed, off-kilter, and unlike anything Marvel has ever attempted, WandaVision is a reality-warping joy that promises a new beginning of the MCU."
WandaVision,1,"The more unexplained moments the show throws at us, and the more it pushes up against what feels like horror, the more it allows the sitcom device to really hammer home its uncanny artificiality."
WandaVision,1,"Something genuinely different from the MCU. Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany & the creative team do a wonderful job recreating classic sitcoms, plus a really good Marvel mystery!"
WandaVision,1,"It's just refreshing to see something that doesn't feel anything like Marvel, but still somehow fits right into the MCU."
WandaVision,1,"The MCU is thinking outside of the box here, and Olsen is on another level. WandaVision is as creative, exciting, and fresh as expected."
WandaVision,1,"The ever so slightly gnawing tedium of [It] suggests that Marvel's reach has not yet become so total that it can plug its characters into literally anything... But, the show is a good enough that it ought to be a big hit."
WandaVision,1,"This ambitious new offering is a breath of fresh air for Marvel, breaking free of the formulaic... blockbusters for a decidedly different approach... hopefully the creativity of WandaVision is a taste of things to come for Marvel."
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a quirky, mysterious, and increasingly engrossing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that boasts a particularly wonderful turn from Elizabeth Olsen."
WandaVision,1,"I'm digging ""The Truman Show"" style of it all, but the jury is still out if the gamble will ultimately pay off or become tiresome."
WandaVision,1,Some inspired moments start to lose their effectiveness because there's less story than there is time to fill. But a new regime brings with it a greater chance that the payoff will justify the patience.
WandaVision,1,"WandaVision is a major stylistic leap for the MCU, and nearly impossible to resist, if you've been invested in these stories for over a decade now - a mind-bending appetiser before we dine in the multiverse."
WandaVision,1,"Above all, it's delightful to watch superhero characters in a big-budget outing and not have a clue what's going to happen next."
WandaVision,1,"A love letter to sitcoms and the perfect show to bring us back into the MCU, WandaVision is Marvel's most exciting project yet,with an unmissable, Emmy-worthy performance from Elizabeth Olsen."
WandaVision,1,"""WandaVision"" teases a lot of grief and trauma, but initially is content to play sitcom house and toy around with silly TV homages and tropes."
WandaVision,1,Director Matt Shakman and head writer Jared Schaeffer have created a dazzling and vibrant extension of the Marvel Universe that exudes originality and excite fans.
WandaVision,1,This show is banana pants crazy -- in the best way possible! Stick with it and there are sure to be some MAJOR Marvel style reveals and action sequences!
Hawkeye,1,"While Hawkeye doesn't feel like anything particularly special within the larger MCU, it provides a few thrills as well as strong introductions to several characters who hopefully shine better once they take center-stage in their own stories."
Hawkeye,1,"More exceptional Marvel and Disney excitement. All said, Jeremy Renner did a great job, as did Hailee Steinfeld, but the truest bit of excitement for me was when Native actress Alaqua Cox made it on screen. An appreciative shout to Zahn McClarnon as well."
Hawkeye,0,"If you are very much plugged into the Marvel Universe, yes its a Must Watch. If youre not that bothered, then no."
Hawkeye,1,"It absolutely breezes by, and the Christmas angle  plus the cute dog  are a fun holiday twist on what might otherwise be just another Marvel vehicle."
Hawkeye,1,"Jeremy Renner reprises his role as the worlds most underrated Avenger, Clint Barton, in this funny Christmas adventure that focuses on friendship and family."
Hawkeye,1,"Though the show lacks the depth of Wanda or the far-reaching implications of Loki, it has a humanity that makes its material easier to relate to."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is a great journey with plenty of Christmas warmth, action, humour and some good character development for Hawkeyes both old and new."
Hawkeye,1,The series quickly settles in the Marvel factory mold. [Full review in Spanish]
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is an entertaining romp that doesn't feel as bound by the MCU timeline.
Hawkeye,1,"A lot of fun, and it counts as a holiday series at that..."
Hawkeye,1,"What it lacks in plot, however, it more than makes up for in the delightful pairing of Renner and Steinfeld who boast enough charm, charisma and star-wattage power to just about keep the show on the road."
Hawkeye,1,"It's a little early to call this show a bullseye, however, it's a fun game to watch."
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
Hawkeye,1,Steinfeld brings a charm and strong will to Kate which makes her the perfect choice to take over the Hawkeye name. Steinfeld and Renner make a great duo with great chemistry and humor.
Hawkeye,1,"It doesn't feel entirely necessary in the increasingly bloated Marvel Universe, but this miniseries is still an enjoyable holiday trifle for superhero fans."
Hawkeye,1,"This six-part Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series is another cleverly conceived, brilliantly cast piece of the Phase 4-puzzle."
Hawkeye,1,If you miss this one it's not clear if you will have any trouble following whatever comes up next in the movies. Although it must be said this show is still more entertaining than all three hours of Eternals.
Hawkeye,0,"Steinfeld deserves a better introduction than this piece of tinsel which, in its first two episodes, never transcends the rating of fine."
Hawkeye,0,"The show has so little faith in our interest in Clint Barton as a character that it buries his best moments under a sea of Kate Bishop screentime and backstory, hoping the shiny new hero will appease audiences more than Renner's veteran."
Hawkeye,1,What's the best way to handle a humorless Avenger? Put him in as many scenes as possible where he's made to feel uncomfortable and watch the comedy flow.
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye works because of the chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld, but also because it prioritizes character slightly more than action."
Hawkeye,1,"The old Marvel adage goes that even when it's bad it's good. Not to say that Hawkeye is bad, but it's certainly not the best MCU show - and that's okay."
Hawkeye,1,"This is Kate's journey and Steinfeld runs with it, proving that she may very well be the actress of her generation."
Hawkeye,1,Bullseye!
Hawkeye,1,"The series was loosely inspired by the excellent Matt Fraction and David Aja run of Hawkeye comics, and some of that fun makes its way into the show."
Hawkeye,1,"Renner and Steinfeld have great chemistry together, and their odd couple/buddy cop routine is delightful even when they're not embroiled in action sequences."
Hawkeye,1,Clint Barton and Kate Bishop make a fine team together and one can't wait to see what happens next in Hawkeye.
Hawkeye,1,has a more grounded feel than the rest of the MCU shows but I liked that about it
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is a perfect tribute to New York City and delivers a fun odd couple duo with grumpy Clint partnering with hero-in-training Kate.
Hawkeye,1,"While the show takes plenty of story beats from the 2012 comic series, it manages to translate the feel of that arc into the wider narrative playing out in the MCU."
Hawkeye,1,A 90s styled throwback buddy comedy that brings back personalization and grounded fun to the MCU.
Hawkeye,1,"Call us intrigued by but not smitten with this first third of Hawkeye. If the worst case is it proves to be little more than a light holiday treat, it's hard to be too much of a Grinch about that."
Hawkeye,1,"A fun, free-wheeling action show energized by scene-stealing Hailee Steinfeld, who joins grouchy archer Jeremy Renner for some good honest comfort viewing."
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye is the kind of entertainment that's just right for this Holiday Season. It's fun action with some laughs provided by good-hearted characters in a plot that's simple and uncomplicated.
Hawkeye,1,It's got all the elements you'd expect from a Marvel series. It's a lot of fun.
Hawkeye,1,"It's in that simplicity that Hawkeye really shines, making it a series unlike any of the other Marvel shows we've seen so far."
Hawkeye,1,"Just like Clint's still-mysterious adventures as Ronin have yet to be revealed in full, Maya's story still has plenty of time to come into focus, as the MCU's past and future meet in Hawkeye."
Hawkeye,0,Hawkeye feels like it will end up being a quick wiki article scan to get caught up on where everything stands instead of its own standalone story.
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye' is going to be an enjoyable romp that won't tax the brain or require anything other than for you to have a good time.
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye feels like the most grounded, self-aware project in the MCU to date."
Hawkeye,1,"Whether this chemistry will work is hard to tell at the outset. For MCU fans, however, it is comfort food, a lighter version of a stand-alone movie with well-executed action and an often wry sense of humour."
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye may not be a resounding bullseye but it hits the spot well enough.
Hawkeye,1,"Based on the comic book series created by Matt Fraction, it has a relaxed, low-key vibe, emphasizing the great chemistry between Renner and Hailee Steinfeld as much as the action."
Hawkeye,1,"[Like] the title character, Hawkeye has the same issue: it lacks branding. Sure, Disney might know how to sell it, but the TV series doesn't know what it's about. At least not yet."
Hawkeye,0,This series lacks the zip and polish that Kate Bishop and Clint Barton deserve.
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye refreshes a character that had been pushed to the sidelines with undeniable chemistry and an incredibly promising new leading character.
Hawkeye,1,"With the tired and tested [Jeremy] Renner bouncing comfortably off the enthusiastic, comedically gifted [Hailee] Steinfeld, the future looks bright for a show I'm sure many had their reservations about."
Hawkeye,1,"Rooted in character development yet still dotted with the action MCU fans clamour for, 'Hawkeye' soars on the sparkling dynamic between its two leads."
Hawkeye,1,Another sharp arrow in the Marvel quiver.
Hawkeye,1,"Stuffed with humor and heart, Hawkeye has a lot to offer MCU fans new and old."
Hawkeye,1,"Simply put, in just one episode, Hawkeye does more for the character than 10 years in the MCU has."
Hawkeye,1,"Peak performances from the cast, writing on full ignition, action that thrills, and a lot of room to tell what looks to be a fulfilling coming-of-age for one buddy and the reconciling of the past for the other. Die Hard and Lethal Weapon would be proud."
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye rocks a great mix of playfulness and a sense of real danger. It's also hard to imagine better casting for Kate Bishop than Hailee Steinfeld. Her timing and tone are always spot on and her chemistry with Jeremy Renner is a major highlight.
Hawkeye,0,"Hailee Steinfeld shines, but the rest is forgettable. It says a lot that the Avengers musical, a show within the show, is currently the best thing about this show."
Hawkeye,1,"Yes, people can and will get hurt. But in a world where doom and gloom seem to be all over our media, ""Hawkeye"" uses the character's best superpower to save the day-heart. And sometimes that's all you need."
Hawkeye,1,So firmly locked on target with the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula that it's clearly destined to be another Disney+ month-long viewing addiction.
Hawkeye,1,"Jonathan Igla balances the traditional Marvel action with a lot of humor in Hawkeye. Placing it in New York City at Christmas time gives it a joyous aesthetic, and It lives in a nerdy, self-depreciating world."
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye gets off to a good enough start that I'm curious to see where it goes even if it hasn't entirely gripped me as a viewer.
Hawkeye,1,"Returning to the simplicity of the franchise's first phase, the series is ground-level MCU at its very finest. As someone who never thought a Hawkeye-centric production would EVER work, I'm pleasantly surprised at how great this show is."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye episodes one and two are an awesome blend of the Matt Fraction/David Aja series and Christmas. Fans of Clint Barton are getting the character they've been waiting for in live-action, and Kate Bishop is going to be everyone's new favorite hero."
Hawkeye,1,"When it focuses on its leads, it has the potential to be a relatively diverting, if airless, chapter of the Marvel universe - one unfettered thus far by the weight of Phase Four's multiverse mishegas."
Hawkeye,1,"By showing Clint away from Avengers duties, Hawkeye has turned the character's weaknesses across the films-his normalcy and vulnerability-into his greatest assets."
Hawkeye,1,"Adapting Matt Fraction and David Aja's character-defining run of Hawkeye is no easy feat, but in the new Disney+ series, it's clear that Marvel understands the assignment."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye's aim isn't completely true, but it doesn't prevent the mis-matched duo at its heart from being a real delight."
Hawkeye,1,"""Hawkeye"" is not as ambitious as ""WandaVision,"" but it has a breezy quality that's easy to get into."
Hawkeye,1,"While you might have - some very reasonable - Marvel fatigue, their final show of 2021, Hawkeye, is here to charm and delight even the most cynical viewers."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours."
Hawkeye,1,"Like the best of the MCU on Disney Plus so far, including WandaVision and Loki, Hawkeye stands on its own just enough to largely avoid superhero fatigue."
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
Hawkeye,1,"Steinfeld and Renner are good foils for each other, as Bishop pushes Barton to relax and he tends to her like a fussy aunt."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice..."
Hawkeye,1,"Taken by itself, Hawkeye is a perfectly serviceable action romp. But when there's so many of these things saturating the market, it needs to work a little harder to justify its own existence."
Hawkeye,1,"""Hawkeye"" is a nice return to Earth after all the cosmic stuff we've seen lately. It's a reminder of why you fell in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the first place."
Hawkeye,1,"For lovers of the comic, the series nails specific aspects - the ones that count."
Hawkeye,0,"Acknowledging that the character is the least-exciting Avenger can be fun in small doses, but it's not a thing to base an entire series on."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is more Kate Bishop origin story than Clint Barton solo series, but Steinfeld and Renner's dynamic makes for a delightful holiday adventure."
Hawkeye,1,"Welcome back, old MCU, we've missed you.Clint and Kate have made their way into my heart as Marvel's most iconic duo."
Hawkeye,1,Hawkeye does just as wonderful of a job exploring Kate Bishop as it does the title hero himself. This cheerful and action-packed series is off to a good start.
Hawkeye,1,"Clint Barton has not always been the easiest Avenger to rally behind, and Hawkeye doesn't look to make him more likeable. It does double down on what makes Clint such an interesting paradox of a man."
Hawkeye,0,"The action scenes are perfunctory, the dialogue glum rather than glittering. And the mentor-protégée chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld might be kindly described as a work in progress."
Hawkeye,1,It remains to be seen whether or not the payoff will be as compelling as the setup.
Hawkeye,1,Its low-key vibe is precisely what makes it feel special.
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is modest in terms of threats and mythos compared to its MCU Disney+ predecessors, but it is nonetheless charming and full of heart."
Hawkeye,1,"A chill is in the air, snow might fall, and crunchy action is likely to break out at any time without a moment's notice in Hawkeye."
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye delivers brilliantly choreographed action, the heart that made people fall in love with Marvel in the first place and a wholesome dynamic between Clint and Kate that viewers will be desperate to see more of."
Hawkeye,1,"Steinfeld is a wonderful actress who has a knack of portraying intelligent, sarcastic, and athletic females and Kate Bishop doesn't stray far from that mold."
Hawkeye,1,"It starts off a little slow, and seems lower budget than previous Marvel Disney+ shows. But Renner & Steinfeld are both super charismatic so the show is a lot of fun."
Hawkeye,1,"The return of street-level Marvel stories is refreshing, and the Christmastime setting of Hawkeye - combined with Marvel's classic comedy - helps provide some needed levity in an otherwise dark series."
Hawkeye,1,"Absolutely perfect in every way this series is easily the best Marvel Disney+ show yet. Hailee Steinfeld embodies everything that Kate Bishop is, and is the series standout."
Hawkeye,1,"As a big fan of the Matt Fraction & David Aja run, it's fantastic to see Lucky the Pizza Dog as the best doggo in the MCU, while Steinfeld is pitch perfect as Kate Bishop."
Hawkeye,1,Marvel's latest offers grounded look at Avenger arrow slinger.
Hawkeye,1,"Marvel Studios is once again sleigh-in' it with Hawkeye, an unmissable Christmastime team-up bringing holiday cheer to the MCU with top tier storytelling delivered in the Mighty Marvel Manner & a bold, brilliant new hero in Hailee Steinfeld's Kate Bishop."
Hawkeye,1,An easily digestible MCU series aiming for more families to watch together for the holidays - it's a bullseye for Hawkeye fans.
Hawkeye,1,"Hawkeye is a phenomenal entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the perfect showcase for Jeremy Renner to finally give us the full Clint Barton experience, aided by a show-stopping performance from Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"The last three episodes are absolutely perfect, and show who were the true stars of this show. Magnificent ending. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,These last four episodes of Clone Wars is the best Star Wars movie I've seen in a while.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"Season 7 was really all about the final story, and it was more than worth reviving the series for, and stands alongside the very best from the series and its sequel."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"While I will exhaust hours arguing Sequel Trilogy defenders, I'm sure all Star Wars fans will agree the Clone Wars finale is some of the best the entire saga has to offer."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,Some of the best Star Wars I've seen in years.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,A mix of the excellent and the bloated; some the best stuff that Filoni has done for the series. [Full review in Spanish]
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"Sombre, thrilling and brilliantly done, The Final Season is a fine end to one of the best things about Star Wars."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"Every prequel should however, in the end, make the larger story better, and while Lucas' actual prequel trilogy struggled to do that, The Clone Wars pulled it off."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"In the endgame, the show is better than ever."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"This season will also serve as a gauge to see whether audiences want more of the STAR WARS saga told in animated form. If it comes even close to the quality of The Clone Wars, the answer will undoubtedly be yes."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"The action sequences are dynamic, fluid, and the camerawork moves with a coolness and verve."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,'The Bad Batch' was a very welcome return for The Clone Wars. Its impressive visuals and balance of action and focus on the characters makes it feel as if the series had never left.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"This first episode of an arc offers little more than some pulpy action, a slickly staged action sequence, and an enticing cliffhanger. ""The Bad Batch"" is not a spectacular comeback, all things considered, but it's good to be back in the world."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"""The Clone Wars"" kicked off its last season with a war-filled episode that will certainly have fans talking... But the episode tells all ""Star Wars"" fans that it's time to unite one more time and get through the ongoing battle together."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"All the major names that returned to the Star Wars movies over the past half-decade were certainly exciting, and hearing animation stalwart Dee Bradley Baker's voice in new episodes of The Clone Wars is in many ways equally thrilling."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"[T]he standout aspect here is the much-improved animation, especially in the action department."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"This is one of the biggest contributions that The Clone Wars brings to the Star Wars franchise. While the series rehabilitates the weaker parts in the Prequel trilogy, it breaks away from the light-vs.-dark dichotomy that defines the franchise."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"The animation is better than ever, the spirit of the series-a more character-based version of the stories told between ""Attack Of The Clones"" and ""Revenge Of The Sith"" are as compelling as ever."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"It's the brief breath of air that keeps the audience invested in the fates of the soldiers on screen, building up their characters by showing who they are when they aren't fighting for their lives."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"I'm so happy to be writing these words: The Clone Wars is back baby, and it's good! But don't you think for a second that I didn't notice Anakin's longer hair, which is both beautiful and worrisome..."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"While I'm not particularly sold on the Bad Batch being ""truly"" bad, or even all that complicated, they do provide an off-kilter dynamic that may lead to some interesting developments down the line."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"Only time will tell if this arc has enough meat to justify the four-episode structure, but it's off to a promising start."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,[The premiere] effectively reintroduces this narrative and demonstrates some of the reasons why fans find The Clone Wars so much fun in the first place.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,1,"If you're already a fan of The Clone Wars, this initial return suggests a finale that fulfills the promise of everything that's come before. It's beautiful, action-packed, and rich in themes and emotion."
What If...?,1,"While several episodes fail to go above and beyond the typically MCU formula, most stories in this MCU anthology manage to take full advantage of the boundless imagination that the show's concept permits."
What If...?,1,"Not only did What If provide us with clean stories, exciting animation, and a roster of recognizable voices, the season-long arc sent my brain into fangirl overdrive."
What If...?,1,"It's difficult to understand What If...? as something more than an curious experiment.... [it] will frustrate the uninitiated in this world, while provoking sincere enthusiasm from Marvel scholars. [Full review in Spanish]"
What If...?,1,An animation series that may be the best that the platform has released of late. [Full review in Spanish]
What If...?,1,"What If...? is a fun exploration of alternate versions of the MCU, with animation that does a good job of conveying the action that's baked into the MCU recipe."
What If...?,1,An epically fun Twilight Zone-style anthology series that dives into divergent timelines where familiar MCU events played out differently.
What If...?,1,"With dazzling visuals and thrilling storytelling, Marvel's new animated series follows beloved storylines to new ends and scores on every level."
What If...?,1,In the grand scheme of the MCU it may not be remembered in a few years but I found it a fun weekly half hour and while a little odd the animation style was enjoyable as well.
What If...?,1,"The episodes are short and sweet, and they bring with them intriguing ideas ... some of which I hope end up affecting the MCU movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
What If...?,1,"Much like the comic anthology, some concepts will hit harder than others."
What If...?,1,What If impresses as a visceral redux of the MCU's well-trudged blueprint.
What If...?,1,"Being that it's an animated series, it certainly plays into having a younger audience as its demographic. There's more humor and the storytelling is a bit more simple and wrapped up in a quick fashion."
What If...?,1,The third one was [my favorite] but... they get they get significantly better as they go along.
What If...?,1,The style of animation sees the pages of a comic-book brought to life - a unique touch that goes a long way with regards to hooking the viewer in.
What If...?,1,"Does it feed into the great scheme or just work as a sorbet until Marvel's big-screen offerings kick phase four into gear? For now, enjoy the Easter egg diversion."
What If...?,1,"A bit of a slow start to a series that I am looking forward to, and the first story was a bit of a dud. I am most excited about Jeffrey Wright's voice as The Watcher."
What If...?,1,"The series' roughly 30-minute episodes feel epic enough that, perhaps in another reality, they could have an effect on future MCU stories. Again, they won't have one in the MCU."
What If...?,1,"While an episode like this can never be replicated due to the loss of Boseman, it still shows how What If...? can continue to elevate familiar Marvel characters by making good on the series' limitless potential."
What If...?,1,Atwell's welcome return gives the alternative version of Peggy Carter both powerful confidence and engaging empathy.
What If...?,1,They've done a really great job at taking the characters that we know from live action and then making them into these animation characters.
What If...?,1,"This beautifully animated new series features loads of action, a dope voice cast, and an outstanding premise. What's not to love?"
What If...?,1,Fans will get a kick out of Marvel's first-ever animated series which takes familiar scenes out of MCU movies and switches up beloved characters. Hearing the original cast members adds to the nostalgia including Chadwick Boseman's last time as T'Challa
What If...?,1,"An action-packed dive into the MCU in new, unique and exciting ways... Sporting fantastic animation and an A-list cast of familiar voices, it's perhaps one of the most lavish animated series ever pulled together!"
What If...?,1,"They're setting things up for the multiverse movie, and it's making me more and more excited for... the new stuff coming up."
What If...?,0,"""What If...?"" is more of a ""WTF?"" Under all the bells and whistles, the Disney streamer is blatantly aiming to stave off losing Marvel subscribers with Saturday morning standard graphics and pretty rudimentary storytelling."
What If...?,1,"For those already on board, What If...? will, more often than not, play as an enjoyable, if thin, bit of television. For those unfamiliar or actively skeptical of the MCU, nothing here will persuade them to reconsider."
What If...?,1,"Each of the three half-hour episodes made available for review locked me in with breezy scripts, an agile narrative energy and a mesmerizing, near-photorealistic animations style."
What If...?,1,"The story, animation style and short running time don't always come together, but the first three episode still showcase a very exciting creative swing for Marvel."
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
What If...?,1,They undoubtedly only scratch the surface of the many mind-bending possibilities to explore - not really proving as groundbreaking or inventive as hoped.
What If...?,1,"Much like how Steve and Bucky viewed her in The First Avenger, they are open to Peggy knowing more than them, but in What If...? she's the leader and stronger than everyone, and it's accepted and celebrated-and it's what Peggy Carter deserves."
What If...?,1,"The questions the show poses about the MCU make it a unique, fascinating series that pushes its audience to think critically about elements we take for granted in Marvel's live-action universe."
What If...?,1,"If you enjoyed the colourful chaos of the magnificent Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, then you'll absolutely fall in love with Disney+'s latest Marvel series."
What If...?,0,"While my curiosity is piqued, I wasn't completely blown away by this outing."
What If...?,0,"Each episode may begin with What If...?, but they end, resoundingly, with nothing more than ""So what?"""
What If...?,1,"It notably stumbles into a mistake that always irks me in alternate-universe stories like this, but aside from that, it's just an absolute blast."
What If...?,1,"For dedicated Marvel enthusiasts, on the other hand, What If ...? might feel inessential. But the prospect of speculative fan-fiction with a stamp of approval will be hard to resist."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
What If...?,1,Maybe not quite on par with some of the great Batman or Superman cartoons we've gotten over the years.
What If...?,1,"What If...? is playful enough with its creativity, but these half-hour jaunts feel more like curiosities than essential text."
What If...?,1,"It's clever as hell, daring in its alternate realities being served up, and produced with the state-of-the standards you'd expect from Marvel and Disney."
What If...?,0,"Perhaps Marvel's What If...? will be more accessible to non-discerning younger viewers, but for adults, there is not much here to recommend."
What If...?,1,"Quite simply, the kind of rewarding, well-produced joy that any fan of Marvel's recent content is going to lap up with glee."
What If...?,1,"One of those cases where ""what you see is what you get"" and that's perfectly fine. The anthological format prevents developing great long-term stories but wont' matter as long as the series maintains its current quality standard.[Full review in Spanish]"
What If...?,1,"although ""What If ...?"" is based on a fundamentally dubious concept, the three episodes sent over for review do enough right to be entertainingly worthwhile."
What If...?,1,"Overall, What If...? is a promising fresh take on a plethora of stories within the MCU landscape."
What If...?,1,Superb storytelling coupled with astounding animation make What If...? one of Marvel Studios' all-around best projects.
What If...?,1,"The writing is imaginative and unpredictable with a great understanding of the worlds and characters within the franchise, and the voice cast is fantastic, aside from a few A-list no shows"
What If...?,1,"What If...? combines creative minds and talents to develop fresh and innovative alternative realities, while honoring the core of the MCU characters."
What If...?,0,"The idea of taking such popular, well-worn characters and scrambling them throughout this massive worldbuilding experiment sounds fun, but the results so far are pretty lukewarm."
What If...?,1,"As a short-form animation without an overriding plot What If...? is more interesting than gripping, and sometimes the animation style looks a bit stiff on-screen (though notably, less so in the excellent action scenes)."
What If...?,1,Marvel's animated series is a much-needed change of pace for the aging superhero franchise. What If...? is navigating this shiny new multiverse with the giddiness of a kid exploring a massive sandbox.
What If...?,1,What If...? is a good start to what could be a strong set of animated series in the Disney+ Era of Marvel (something it's been lacking).
What If...?,1,"The result resembles enhanced Jonny Quest as much as Jack Kirby, but it's cool enough. And when things get crazy -- as they do at cosmic scale in each episode so far -- an almost Lovecraftian level of fearsome grandeur fills the screen."
What If...?,1,"It's like the movies in that it tells a fascinating story MCU fans can geek over. That's the easiest way to explore it. But though it's a good show for MCU fans, it's hard to say it's a must-watch. Right now, it doesn't matter."
What If...?,1,"It's an especially savvy way of super-serving fans, in a package that's colorful and fast-paced enough to entertain those who might not get every reference or wrinkle in time."
What If...?,1,"For fans who are already all-in on anything that Marvel Studios does, Marvel's What If..? will be a satisfying remix, even with the show's frustrating shortcomings."
What If...?,1,"It's hard to predict where What If will go, but judging by this first episode, the show has a lot of room for improvement if it wants to be the same kind of appointment viewing that its live-action counterparts have proven to be."
What If...?,1,"Those ellipses in What If...?, rather than a punctuated full stop, also echo one of the show's greatest strengths: leaving fans wanting more."
What If...?,1,"Though it feels inevitable that What If will eventually play into the live-action space in a direct way, what's exciting about the show is how Marvel seems keen on keeping it around for at least one more season."
What If...?,1,A relatively breezy and often humorous series that puts a quirky and borderline goofy spin on the Marvel timeline as we know it.
What If...?,0,"For a series set in the infinite vastness of a multiverse, What If...? is dreaming awfully small."
What If...?,1,"Marvel Studios' first animated series is a stylish narrative experiment with fun twists and surprises -- nothing more, nothing less. For the uninitiated, it's impenetrable."
What If...?,1,"It's fun simply because the level of quality control at Marvel is pretty high these days, and because some of the ideas are either inherently appealing... But not every installment lives up to the title's seemingly limitless potential."
What If...?,1,"""What If...?"" might not win over the superhero-averse, but if you're a fan who has grown a bit fatigued of Disney's biggest franchise recently, this could be the antidote you've been needing."
What If...?,1,"For right now, though, its appeal lies largely in its connection to what came before. Perhaps the show's strongest quality is just how many MCU all-stars return in their signature roles; even some truly minor supporting actors."
What If...?,1,Expect the unexpected ... This series is a treat for comic and MCU fans. All of these scenarios and different outcomes are so much fun to watch
What If...?,1,There's a fluidity to the series that doesn't betray the weight of the characters and the world around them. It gives the action scenes a level of inventiveness and movement that even the best of the MCU films have had trouble matching.
What If...?,1,"The anthology format might bug some. But if you're used to the way the comics set themselves up and are looking for the MCU with a twist, you'll have a good time with this one!"
What If...?,1,Should thrill Marvel Cinematic Universe fans with these fascinating alternative scenarios for some of the most beloved MCU stories.
What If...?,1,"Despite some issues with pacing and a relatively mixed bag of one-off concepts, there's more than enough charm, imagination, and pulse-pounding excitement to make What If? a worthy addition to Disney+'s Marvel repertoire."
What If...?,1,"Marvel enters the animation arena very aggressively - and effectively. MCU fans will be over the moon with this show, and Captain Carter is a fantastic new addition."
What If...?,0,"A galaxy-level cast, for a TikTok-level Disney+ series. [Marvel's] first animated series [...] allows it to operate on a different canvas [but] the first three episodes don't push the envelope. What If...? feels like a footnote in the MCU encyclopaedia."
What If...?,1,"Marvel's What If...? doesn't quite maximize the potential of the premise, but the first three episodes are packed full of exciting action, Easter Eggs and major surprises."
What If...?,1,"Marvel's ""What If...?"" is entertaining and fun and an enjoyable remix of MCU origins, but it could stand to have some more unique storytelling."
What If...?,0,"What If...? opens up a world of possibility for Marvel, which it explores with enthusiasm, but also, in an act of hubris, with one hand tied smirkingly behind its back."
What If...?,1,"What If...? may be animated but at the end of the day, this series is still canon and essential viewing."
What If...?,1,"Endlessly imaginative and entertaining, What If...? stays firm in its roots while allowing its characters and fans to play in realms beyond."
What If...?,1,The first three episodes show a potential that has not exploded yet. (...) An homage of what has happened and a statement for what's to come. [Full review in Spanish]
What If...?,1,"The sandbox What If...? gets to play in is large and shows intriguing promise. The first three episodes just hardly scratch that surface. It's a solid start, but this first batch of episodes leaves a lot to be desired."
What If...?,1,"Marvel's very own version of the Twilight Zone, What If...? gets dark with some unexpected twists and turns as we dive headfirst into the multiverse."
What If...?,1,"An instant animated classic, What If...? delivers world after world of endless possibilities you need to explore, and if what we see from these first three chapters is any indication, Marvel Studios has delivered a mind-bending MCU masterpiece."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"I want to believe this dire six-part action movie was just an unnecessary origin story, a very long prologue to an actual new kind of adventure about the first Black Captain America's difficult journey through a difficult world."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,Its timely racially and politically charged plot lacks focus.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Although the series got off to a slow start, the adventures of Captain America's best friends Falcon/Sam Wilson and Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes have picked up considerably as the action/espionage series continues."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The show feels like a really extended movie with a bad villain. It depends too much on the legacy of Steve Rogers with really interesting secondary characters that try to live up to him. [Full review in Spanish]
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,Once again using its Avengers B-team to both focus on larger issues while setting up future films. If you still haven't seen the Disney+ drama -which aired its season finale on April 23- it's time to fly in.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"""That The Falcon and the Winter Soldier works at all is mainly down to Mackie and Stan."""
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Why must Sam, or anyone for that matter, don a nation's name and symbols in order to be a fitting hero? The show never provides a satisfactory answer."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,This series does a fantastic job of connecting the MCU to an intriguing new plot line designed especially for television.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,I don't think this series will re-invent the Marvel wheel or come with a clever new bent like we saw with WandaVision but it should satisfy Marvel fans.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"The most cinematic I've ever seen for a TV show and quite frankly, it's wasted on a 52-inch screen."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,Falcon and the Winter Soldier showed it's possible to actually have a black lead in a show and not be tokenistic about it.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,I needed a Marvel thesaurus to watch this show. I loved the Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan team-up but wanted a bit more in terms of the super-soldier status of Captain America
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,It seems that Marvel is taking giant and safe steps to get the audience to forget Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Of course, the outcome of 'Falcon and the Winter Soldier' has many more implications, although the most interesting comes from what the world would look like in one where everyone was super. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,The Falcon and the Winter Soldier attempts to move past the MCU's abysmal track record on women.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"It feels at times like two different shows and not everything always worked for me, but I still mostly enjoyed watching it."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"While not flawless by any means The Falcon and The Winter Soldier showed us some major spectacle and some really interesting, grounded story telling."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"It's far from a perfect show, but it had moments of emotion and connection that have often been lacking in the MCU as a whole."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,The Falcon and the Winter Soldier may have struggled with defining its tone... But its commitment to the overarching theme of American heroes and the dangers of exceptionalism has been unwavering.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Falcon and the Winder Soldier proves to be a more mature take on a story full of characters living in a grey area, so it is up to the audience to decide where to draw the line regarding the moral and ethical conflicts presented by the series."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Since the conclusion of 'Endgame,' each Phase 4 project has dealt with loss, recovery, or filling the void in some way. The latest MCU entrant is no different."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"This is not only a highly engaging action-adventure series about who will be the next Captain America superhero, it also offers an informed discussion about symbolism, race, American history, heroism and image."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Oh, Marvel you truly are a marvel."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Overall, it just felt like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier had little purpose, other than to pass the Captain America baton."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"TFATWS boasts the rhythms & pacing of a film applied to the structure of a television show, without much thought devoted to how each medium works."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"What's more frustrating at this point is, despite everything raised in the series so far, the emphasis of the show always leads back to the ethical dilemma about how we fight instead of who we fight for."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Though The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a less ambitious, inventive project than other Marvel outings, it is at least a smart one."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,They're great actors who are now given the chance to really shine.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"It is less of a treasure hunt than WandaVision, but could deliver some game-changing moments for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"A fascinating look at the inner lives of these heroes, one that simply wasn't on offer in the films."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier feels more MCU than any of the previous television or streaming shows, despite Spellman and Skogland's limited film experience."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,1,"Everything about the show, including -- most critically -- its heart and humor, will feel comfortably familiar to anyone who's laughed, cried, or cheered during a Marvel film."
Star Wars Rebels,1,Star Wars Rebels has pulled out all the stops when it comes to the more mysterious elements of Star Wars lore. But it has also stayed true to the show's main characters.
Star Wars Rebels,1,I just thought this finale was tremendous.
Star Wars Rebels,1,"If you haven't seen Star Wars Rebels, you're gonna want to catch up. Much like The Clone Wars, it's got some of the strongest and most creative storytelling in the Star Wars franchise, but gets unfairly ignored by virtue of being an animated series."
Star Wars Rebels,1,The best yet... The endgame was strong in this one.
Star Wars Rebels,1,"And now, with the final episodes of Star Wars Rebels in the books, those fans have been rewarded with a thorough-and thoroughly exciting-concluding chapter of the rebels' story."
Star Wars Rebels,1,"This isn't to suggest that tonight's episode, 'Rebel Assault', is a bad installment or that it takes the season off track - quite the opposite, in fact - but having it serve as midseason finale makes for an arbitrary point in the action to hit pause."
Star Wars Rebels,1,"Star Wars Rebels easily could have lasted another year or two before taking its final bow, but at least it ends on its own terms."
Star Wars Rebels,1,'Heroes of Mandalore Parts 1 and 2' provides an action-packed introduction to the season that also speaks to over-arching themes.
Star Wars Rebels,1,"As long as those endings are satisfying, as long as they honor all of the wonderful characters, Rebels' four-year journey will have been a successful one."
Star Wars Rebels,1,"Star Wars Rebels just gets back to brass tacks, pushing much of the show's arcs to the side to focus on one: Sabine, the Mandalorians, and the vague but powerful weapon she helped create."
"Love, Victor",1,"In its three seasons, Love, Victor educates viewers through characters with different and well-rounded lives and therefore influences hearts to be open to perspectives they’ve never properly considered."
"Love, Victor",0,"Whether the fantasy ending is due to an early cancellation or the desire to tie everything up with a tidy bow, this final season is unsatisfying. The characters are shadows of themselves, and the interesting messiness (and queer focus) is all but gone"
"Love, Victor",1,"Last episode was pretty sparse, but this time, we’ve got a bit of everything."
"Love, Victor",1,"This is the weakest season, but there are well-fleshed out characters and wonderful storylines. It is a heartfelt ending overall."
"Love, Victor",1,"The show continues combining complex themes with its feel-good vibe, culminating in a worthy send-off."
"Love, Victor",1,"The series that brought normalcy and vital representation to the gay community ends its run in fine form. This is a touching and fitting send-off for the hit, inclusive teen drama."
"Love, Victor",1,The treacly sweetness of the series continues to be its most palatable feature precisely because the show’s goal has always been as much about didacticism as it has been about entertainment.
"Love, Victor",1,"Love, Victor is aware of its lane and it’s pleasantly happy to stay on cruise control for its last set of episodes. That might sound like I’m being sarcastic, but “approachable high school fairy tale” is a vibe, and they’re right to ride it."
"Love, Victor",1,"If this is the end, Love, Victor is bidding farewell in an entertaining, heartfelt, funny and uplifting fashion, which is all we could have really asked for."
"Love, Victor",1,"The third and final season “Love, Victor” brings the story of Victor Salazar’s queer coming-of-age full circle. While at its heart the show remains a romantic comedy, it also finally embraces the artistic freedom to truly explore his sexuality."
"Love, Victor",1,"The final season of Love, Victor comes full circle for a fitting and hopeful conclusion. However, due to the extended cast...with a number of established storylines to satisfyingly wrap up...the eight-episode instalment does feel a little overstuffed."
"Love, Victor",0,"Love, Victor’s unfocused final season muddles everything that made the show successful in the past with a wide array of subplots that don’t earn an emotional connection."
"Love, Victor",1,"The final season perfectly closes things out for every character. A bit rushed at times, and it feels far too short with just 8 episodes, yet it comes full circle. Long time fans will be left with a smile on their face, and a tear in their eye."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"With some of the most compelling drama of the series, along with the most impressive action sequences and character moments, season 3 of Daredevil packs a lot into Matt Murdock's return to the streets of Hell's Kitchen."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil is a show that never fails to impress and always finds that balance between giving viewers the key ingredients they want, while adding just the right spice of mystery."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"""Daredevil"" creates a sense of realism partly through visceral, feel-every-rib-break action sequences."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,An extraordinary season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"When it comes to most well-written as well as the best-acted characters on-screen, those titles go to our hero and our villain, Matt Murdock, and Wilson Fisk."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,This season is relentless from the get-go and absolutely does not disappoint as the Man Without Fear returns from the dead to bring down one of his most iconic villains.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil season 3 is a canny and intelligent return to this un-comic tale of crime, justice, and faith."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Murdock, Fisk and Dex are all well served, acted brilliantly and form an extremely strong backbone to a season that still has other good things going for it. Recommended!"
Marvel's Daredevil,1,Watching the Devil of Hell's Kitchen emerge from the darkness is pure adrenaline -- Daredevil Season 3 enthralls.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil's third season is both thought-provoking and entertaining, something Marvel/Netflix shows have struggled with for the last few years."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Lost in the excitement of ""Daredevil's"" return is the realization that this is the first new season in 2 1/2 years. And the show has never been better than it is right now."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"So it's a pleasant surprise to return to Daredevil for season three and find a stripped-back, focused crime story that once again grips from episode to episode."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Cox's Daredevil is perhaps the most brooding and thought-provoking he has been yet - and his performance follows suit, giving viewers possibly the most true-to-page Daredevil ever seen on-screen."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"When D'Onofrio is allowed to be Fisk, to really embody the cruelty and spirit of the villain, he taps into a strain of excited fear, like the tingle you feel after lightning flashes but thunder hasn't yet struck."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,D'Onofrio has planted a top 5 performance this season.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Puts the focus where it belongs: on Matt, Fisk, Foggy, and Karen, the core characters that we originally grew to love or hate back in Season 1."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Every Netflix MCU show has sought to imitate the first season of Daredevil in some way, with decidedly mixed results. Season 3 shows that Daredevil still does Daredevil best."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"It took a while to get going...but this became my favorite season, a nail-biting exercise in perfectly-executed tension. I was so pleased with the writing..."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil's third season does not simply pick up where the last one left off, but rather after the events of the mashup miniseries The Defenders."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Creator Drew Goddard and Erik Oleson have created an adept season that goes back to its roots, but also grows from them. This tortured hero has an exceptional arc, across from a menacing villain, with an assortment of significant side characters."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,I just enjoyed a lot of the backstory about Daredevil that was explored more this time.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,I thought it was a great season...I definitely liked it more than season two.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,Some of the shots in this show are incredible because they do long-lasting fight sequences...The fight choreography is really beautiful.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"It wasn't great, but it was the first Marvel/Netflix season in years where the ratio of what worked versus what didn't was positive -- a bounceback this show, and this entire mini-franchise, very badly needed."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Daredevil is still the best of the Marvel shows on Netflix, but these shows have grown too alike and all suffer from pacing issues."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,A masterful season.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While flawed, the third season of Daredevil delivers on its promise to shock and entertain, to grant us deeper insight into a tormented hero with everything to lose."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Sure, there are still pacing issues (13 eps is still too many), but it's also weirdly refreshing to see a season without a single cameo or surprise guest from another part of the Marvel universe."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While the ""brave hero who loses everything and believes he has to put himself on an island to win"" trope is infuriatingly overplayed, it seems to work for season three."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,I could show this to anybody... the accessibility level of this show is amazing.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"But more important than fidelity to the source material is the result. In that, Season 3 excels, with the six episodes provided for review representing the best of the series, and, arguably, of Netflix's corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Oleson and Co. have crafted such a dense, dark set-up here that, for the first time since Jessica Jones' first season, diving back into the streets of Hell's Kitchen feels more like a treat than a chore. Thank God."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The show may never have the spark it did in its earliest days, but it did help elevate the way stories of superheroes can be told on television. There's still progress to be made, but ""Daredevil"" feels like it's on the right track."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"But good news, Daredevil fans, the third season-which drops in its entirety this week-is genuinely good again thanks in no small part to the return of Vincent D'Onofrio as the devilishly menacing Kingpin."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"As strong as season three of Daredevil was, here's hoping Netflix grabs the devil by the horns and graces us with another installment."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Gone is the mystical nonsense of The Hand and K'un-Lun, replaced by the sheer brilliance and brutality of the return of Wilson Fisk. He was a key part of why season 1 was so great, but here in season 3, Fisk has been fully unleashed."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"What ""Daredevil"" does particularly well this season is build engaging side stories that keep the momentum going as we wait for Murdock to get back into costume."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,Daredevil: Season 3 kicks Marvel's Netflix slump to the side in favor of a dark and powerful rollercoaster of redemption that makes every scene count and brings back Wilson Fisk at Matt Murdock's white (suited) whale.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"For a chunk of the season, the main characters barely interact with each other. It's one of the reasons why the season works."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Season three is a back-to-basics approach and it's one that'll thrills fans who fell in love with the rough-and-tumble, grounded spirit of the first season."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,[T]he best season yet for the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"D'Onofrio puts in another superb turn as the Kingpin, and he's so intensely watchable that Fisk makes up for much of the shortcomings of Daredevil season 3 early on."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"It's exhilarating, special, and impossible to look away from."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"What's clear is that [showrunner Erik] Oleson and his staff course-correct after an over-crowded second season, returning the focus to the people who live in this story."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"All the things you liked about season 1 are here: the innovative cinematography, the creative manipulation of flashbacks, the brutal close hand-to-hand beatdowns. Some of these shots, as stills, are worthy of art classes all by themselves."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,Daredevil's third season is a return to form.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The new baddie's arrival on the scene is perhaps one of the new season's best achievements -- not simply because of the character's popularity in the comics, but due to the careful manner by which the writers and Bethel breathe life into him."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Perhaps more than any show in the whole Marvel-Netflix Globular Cluster, Daredevil makes me question everything I like and everything I dislike about the Heroes for Hire and their simultaneously intriguing and mind-numbing transits through space-time."
Marvel's Daredevil,0,"Despite marquee villains new and old, the Man Without Fear thus risks becoming the Series That Induces Sleep."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"I'm still watching, so I guess it's good enough. But I also know it could be so much better."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,Daredevil is back and kicking ass and you will not leave your seat until you finish this stellar run.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Unlike the previous two seasons, Season 3 minimizes Matt and his moral dilemmas to make more room for what is truly one of Marvel's best supporting casts."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Just as Matt Murdock rises from the ashes and rubble to save Hell's Kitchen one more time, Daredevil Season 3 could potentially do the same for Marvel shows on Netflix."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"[Season 3] is a strong outing,... as new showrunner Erik Oleson reorients the Man Without Fear to very much be full of fear and obstacles as he attempts to climb his way out of the debris of everything that has come before."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While the show definitely unpacks the moral gray areas its players exist in, the characters' conceptualizations of themselves are all very black and white."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Vincent D'Onofrio continues to give a rich, powerful, and intense performance as Fisk. Many say that he is one of the best comic book villains in the MCU and I would argue he's one of the best in the superhero genre."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,There are things to love. There are things not to love. Matt is great. Fisk is great. Bullseye is awesome. Everything not involving those three people is... okay.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"At the center of it all, there is Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin. Desperately missed from season two, the show once again feels at home telling the parallel stories of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"The search for answers... make for a compelling first half of the season, resulting in the first truly bingeable season of a Marvel TV show since Daredevil season 1."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,It's with the action sequences that Daredevil's latest season truly outdoes itself.
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"Three seasons in, I feel confident saying that Daredevil is not only the most consistent show Marvel has produced, but it's also episode-for-episode the best."
Marvel's Daredevil,0,Where does this go from here? Can Daredevil survive a fourth season? Or is it time for the character to hang up his horns for good?
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"There's a linear flow to it all that is focused and efficient. That doesn't mean the show couldn't lose steam like so many other promising yet still flawed Marvel series on Netflix. But so far, so good."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"With explosive, intense action sequences, fascinating character work, and nuanced performances from its lead cast, Daredevil Season 3 is absolutely a return to form - and that goes for both the show itself and the Netflix corner of the MCU as a whole."
Marvel's Daredevil,1,"While it's partly let down by its glacially-paced first three episodes, Daredevil season 3 manages to find its footing before long. Fans of the ongoing battle between Matt Murdock and Kingpin will not be disappointed."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"A few less-than-stellar episodes knocks it down a bit, but it's still well worth watching, especially the final few episodes."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"The animated series isn't as flashy as The Mandalorian, but finds ways to reward the people most invested in its story"
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"In the end, The Bad Batch is a fun outing for hardcore Star Wars fans who want to know every aspect of the universe. But for those who are just looking for another Mandalorian, well, these are not the clones you are looking for."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"The Bad Batch is catnip for the dedicated Star Wars fans. It's an animated action-adventure series with thrills, relatable characters on the right side of the war, blaster guns and enough lore and easter eggs to invoke a few excited squeals."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"I'm not a superfan of Star Wars animated series, but I am impressed with this one, a team of certifiable rejects, each with their own skillset, is a winning formula for me - excellent actually"
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,Do you love Clone Wars? Do you fantasize being Dave Filoni's cowboy hat to be as close to that brilliant Star Wars brain as possible? Then The Bad Batch is for you.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"The prequels are just as full of rich potential as the original Star Wars trilogy, and The Bad Batch, like The Clone Wars before it, is set to do a lot of slow, careful work to tease out that potential."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,"This series delivers on precisely what fans would expect from a Star Wars story: world building, unique new characters, and big action sequences with a moral allegory at the center."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,A great show that hooks on the quirky adventures of Clone Force 99. [Full Review in Spanish]
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,It's definitely going to sate the hardcore Star Wars fan who is going to want a weekly dose.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,The Bad Batch feels familiar but also starts a new journey with new characters in a cool setting. I can't wait to see what happens with this group in the Empire.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,1,Should satisfy Clone Wars fans.
Gravity Falls,1,"Even if some of the fantasy elements feel overly familiar, the characters are anything but."
Gravity Falls,1,"Gravity Falls treats its young viewers with respect, and with a lot of trust. It never gives the impression of tricking kids into seeing something they shouldn't... just tricking their parents into letting them see something they might not be allowed to."
Gravity Falls,1,"You may have to wrestle with Disney XD's downright disrespectful broadcast schedule to find the rare new episodes, but trust us, it will be worth it."
Gravity Falls,1,"I don't care how old you are, if you're not watching Gravity Falls you're missing out on some of the cleverest, most enjoyable television you can find."
Gravity Falls,1,"It's funny, emotional, beautiful, and terrifying in equal measure."
Gravity Falls,1,"It's always nice to see a show end on its own terms, especially when those terms are as beautifully executed as Gravity Falls' series finale."
Gravity Falls,1,"We can't go back, but we do have the memories. We have the time spent in one of the most fully realized fictional worlds to ever grace the TV screen. We have the brilliant and funny characters."
Gravity Falls,1,"Gravity Falls"" deserves to be in the conversation... when people discuss the best animated programming of the '10s. It is a beautiful blend of old-fashioned storytelling with a modern sense of humor that never feels like it's talking down to kids."
The Owl House,1,"Despite its momentum being noticeably cut off at the knees, The Owl House is still worth watching, if only because it’s impressive how much it’s been able to pull off with its short existence."
The Owl House,1,"The Owl House is brilliant. It’s sharp and funny, with evocative world-building and compelling characters. It’s funny and heartful and gorgeously animated."
The Owl House,1,It’s a rare gift to scoot close to a storyteller who understands the power and responsibility of crafting queer characters; to witness who you are and were and can be in a realm of make-believe.
The Owl House,1,"It’s not just the gruesome landmarks and queer romance that have made The Owl House such a teen fandom mainstay, however. It’s how much fun Terrace and the rest of her creative team are clearly having."
The Owl House,1,It's a great change of pace to see this romance treated with the earnestness and dignity of any other romance in Disney cartoons.
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Takes the alternate timeline concept, uses it to great effect and delivers a perfectly fine end to an overall very fun series."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"It ended on a surprisingly quiet, bittersweet note, an ending sequence that-much like the heroes who gather together one year after their team called it quits-is a little sad, a little funny, and feels over before it's really begun."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was never perfect, but it was special, and the finale managed to nail the one thing we never remember about happy endings - no ending is happy forever."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Well, I don't know about you guys, but the final season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could hardly have done a better job of targeting my interests than titling the premiere."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"The swan song season is off to a great start, and hopefully the momentum will stay strong all the way to the bittersweet end."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"It's hard to craft an ending, especially one with so many moving pieces and characters. But there's no doubt this is a good one. Fans should enjoy it, and most importantly it leaves the door open."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"The final Agents of SHIELD clearly sought to wrap up the show for those hardy souls who have loyally stuck around through its seven seasons with a big, bright bow."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,The big question is whether the finale can stick the landing. The answer is a big resounding... kinda.
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"With Season 7 being Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s last, it's a relief that the series has finally done right by Daisy in the romance department with a relationship that is genuinely endearing and built on trust and mutual respect."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Man, I love this era and it's solely because of the music."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"No matter which wild premise they're encountering next, the cast's chemistry and the show's heart remain intact."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"It feels very fitting for a series that, for the past few years, has spent large chunks of time in virtual and/or alternate realities, smartly relying on our love for the characters to carry us through its sometimes-sludgy homegrown mythology."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"An excellent premiere that sets up what seems to be an epic last season. Although I'm sad the show is ending, the agents are going out on their own terms and I couldn't be happier about that."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Ironically, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is the only content Marvel has ready to go. The good news is the final season is looking quite strong."
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1,"Overall, it was a promising start to the farewell season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., with throwbacks to previous episodes, epic fight scenes, and the return of the character who started it all."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,The Punisher's Sophomore Season Barrels Through With Double the Intensity
Marvel's The Punisher,1,It does look like Frank's new lease on life is about up. It is time for The Punisher to start kicking into gear.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"The Punisher Season 2 is a lot of fun - really violent, excessive fun... But there's also no denying that this time around, The Punisher has swapped bullets for brains, leaning into easy entertainment over meaningful narrative."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Although Season 2 of The Punisher begins too sluggishly, and despite its distracting detours and tonal issues, it builds to a largely satisfying conclusion."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,Jon Bernthal Is The Living Embodiment of Frank Castle In An Enjoyable Second Run
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"The Punisher, like the man himself, is not always easy to love. But there's a lesson to be learned in those moments, too, and I hope Frank continues to grow as a person right alongside the series."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Despite the fact that this season seems to take a step back from the first, The Punisher continues to be a worthy piece of entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Marvel's The Punisher,1,There was clearly no one building this story with knowledge that Netflix would be cancelling all of their Marvel shows and that is a shame because the third season could have fnally been worthy of the name of the show.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Marvel's The Punisher,0,This could have been eight episodes.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"I enjoyed this season. I always seem to walk away from The Punisher wondering if it might actually low-key be my favorite of the Marvel/Netflix shows. But it's better when it doesn't try to justify itself, or defend itself."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Season 2 is a good 13 episode story, with plenty of action and great performances from both Jon Bernthal and Ben Barnes as Frank Castle and Billy Russo respectively."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Even though he was a compelling scene-stealer in Daredevil, Frank Castle/The Punisher has never felt quite right in his own show. Season two will do little to change that impression."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,One wishes the show had listened to its titular character: The Punisher is at its best when it just lets the Punisher be the Punisher.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Season two... was a frustrating watch: the pacing felt off, the addition of Giorgia Whigham as Amy didn't quite click, and all in all the season had less drive than its predecessor."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,All the villains in here are some form of mirror on Frank Castle. I found that really cool.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The show's signature fight scenes are still fantastic, as is the Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal. But something seemed to go wrong in the writers' room this go-round."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Marvel and Netflix's ability to hold steady a show revolving around a character that most Americans would consider a nightmare is impressive, and requires a very strict rulebook."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"What makes this season of ""The Punisher"" work so well is that it feels less like a Season 2 and more like a Season 5, a standalone story in the established adventures of Frank Castle."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"It's all better than it needs to be - smarter, sharper, more thoughtful - while also consciously reckoning with the fact that this is a show about a man who's never happier than when he's covered in other people's blood."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Here's the most unforgivable sin of the second season of The Punisher: You have a magnificent performance like this one at your disposal, and this is what you choose to do with it?"
Marvel's The Punisher,1,Bernthal's gravelly voice and thoughtful delivery continue to help uplift even the most melodramatic Frank lines.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Though the second season attempts to redefine who its title character is and where he fits within this corner of the superhero universe, the end result is both an odd fit and a moot point."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,The Punisher season two is relentlessly blood and guts and that unfortunately is just punishing on to itself after a while.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"The Punisher's second season wouldn't be the worst place for the series to end, as it's a strong outing that'll please fans, and does the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most violent antihero justice."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"The best reason to watch the show, aside from Bernthal's charisma and tendency to grunt like a gorilla when he's amped up, is the consistently brutal action."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It's a shame such a wild and impulsive character is likely going out on such an underwhelming note.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"It's too long and doesn't have enough story to adequately fill 13 hours of television. The many pieces of the puzzle also don't start coming together until far too late in the game as a result, and by that point, it's rather hard to care."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Season two is a whole new Frank Castle adventure and all the better for it. From a solid beginning to one of the best homages to Assault on Precinct 13 made in quite some time, The Punisher is bringing a serious A-game to its latest go around the block."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,The Punisher's second season gets off to a slow but satisfying start that focuses on Frank Castle's search for meaning.
Marvel's The Punisher,1,"Bernthal's awards-worthy performance, alongside the well written dialogue and ambitious action choreography, make The Punisher season 2 a worthwhile watch that just about satisfies expectations."
Marvel's The Punisher,1,The Punisher Season 2 is a massive improvement on its predecessor and even stands head-and-shoulders above some of the other shows in the Marvel/Netlix pantheon.
Baymax!,1,"Loaded with charm from the Baymax character, this a sweet reminder that Disney has a rich history of short family-friendly cartoons."
Baymax!,1,"Baymax! dedicates each episode to all healthcare heroes, and they should be happy that such an informative, funny series is made in their honor."
Baymax!,1,"'¡Baymax!' is a vitalist and humanist series that with the pretext of curing a cold or fixing a broken ankle, tells stories about love, affection, and break-ups... These 10-minute [episodes] feel like a hug... [Full review in Spanish]"
Baymax!,1,"Baymax! is light, fluffy short-form warmth that humorously fulfills our need to feel taken care of, watched after, and held accountable."
Baymax!,1,"...BAYMAX! works from start to finish. It’s heartfelt, warm, and is a salve for increasingly darker times."
Baymax!,1,"The series is fun, cute, and something that both parents and kids can enjoy. It is a special one, that delivers on the moments of laugher, but also on the emotional ones."
The Simpsons,1,"""Treehouse of Horror XXXII"" delivers a decent number of laughs across its multiple shorts that begin with a parody of Disney movies with dead parents."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Krysten Ritter, Rachael Taylor, and Carrie-Anne Moss ground the final season with standout performances."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"[F]rom the gritty tone and weighty themes to the morally murky characters and great performances, Jessica Jones' final season is by and large an enjoyable showcase of what we'll miss about these shows as the Defendersverse comes to a close."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Jessica Jones is all about doing the right thing even though you really don't want to. It ends on a perfect note for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one that Stan Lee would be proud of."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,Jessica is alone. Very alone. And you can't take your eyes off her. I look forward to bingeing the rest of the season.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"The good news is that nearly everything interesting about this season is consolidated in the finale anyway, so it's kind of the perfect short hand."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"While it might not be the best of the Marvel Netflix shows, Jessica Jones redeems itself of the misfired second outing while also providing a fond farewell to this era of Marvel TV."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"It was never about the punching, kicking and leaping across buildings, it was always about the emotional battles."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,The acting in Jessica Jones... is first-rate. But it's the confident storytelling -- the long game of a novel-like structure -- that's really the strong suit of [this] Marvel TV [show].
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,At least they got to see Luke and Jessica together for one last time.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" gets off on the wrong foot in Season 3 and stays there until the lackluster end."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"After years of fighting it, season 3 finally sees Jessica embrace her goodness, and the world is better for it."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"After the heightened shenanigans of the first two seasons, there's something quite refreshing about watching our heroine engage in some actual sleuthing this time around..."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Rosenberg's series had its ups and downs, but Ritter remained a powerhouse throughout... It's a masterful performance, and while the first season of Jessica Jones remains the strongest, this run is perhaps Ritter's best."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Even if this wasn't the end, season three meanders far too often to leave any kind of lasting impression."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Once Salinger properly enters the story, season three heats up a bit."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Just when you think this is a series in need of a shock jolt, Jessica Jones season 3 suddenly puts itself in a strong position to pay off its promises."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"While it wasn't the most electrifying way to start a season, it moved the pieces in place for what will hopefully be a strong final season."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Krysten Ritter, Rachael Taylor, and Carrie-Anne Moss each turn in all-time great performances in this episode. Kudos to the phenomenal work they've done thoughout this entire series!"
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,Jessica Jones takes flight with an entertaining final season that erases the bad taste left by the last season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Marvel could use more shows like ""Jessica Jones"" as it relaunches on streaming via Disney+ and Hulu. But next time, it should worry less about seeming serious, or cool, and focus more on telling the best stories in the best way possible."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"If the final five episodes are as good as the first eight, Jessica Jones is going out on one hell(cat) of a high note."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Instead of a bang-up season, Jessica Jones drowns in a tired, overplayed question: What does it mean to be a hero?"
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,Always good to find that silver lining in a pool of your own blood.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"But the real kudos has to go to Carrie-Ann Moss as Jeri Hogarth, who may be having more fun with her role than any actor has ever had."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Better still, the now-expected midseason side quest finally pays off..."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"We can definitely call it a comeback. Jessica Jones returns as the hardboiled detective with the superpowered punch, which makes the start of season three deep, dark, and dynamic. It may not reach the level of S1 but it's a solid close."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Though it began as the one Marvel/Netflix series with the most potential, Jessica Jones has seen its quality dip precipitously with each subsequent season."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Like the seasons that came before it, this run of Jessica Jones is good but nowhere near great."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"It's a make-up story following an ugly breakup, interwoven into a dark, sinuous television universe that has continuously emulated our own, corrupt society so effortlessly."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"If you were hoping to see this era of Marvel Television sail off in the sunset with fireworks and acclaim, you're simply out of luck. Despite falling flat throughout, a few great performances manage to save the season from complete and utter despair."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Jessica Jones' second season was a disjointed mess, and creator and showrunner Melissa Rosenberg has learned from her mistakes. The plots and themes of season 3 are much more tightly interwoven, even if they're not all created equal."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As a final season arc, it simply doesn't hold the kind of water it needs to, to take the show to the kind of satisfying conclusion fans are going to want."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"All of this is very on-brand for Jessica Jones as a show and for Jessica as a character, so much so that this season has the tendency to feel like something you've already seen."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"[Krysten] Ritter, who took such fantastic ownership of this character, deserves more than a season that finds Jessica more or less where it always does-let down by those around her."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"If you're just watching it as a straightforward thriller, Jessica Jones season 3 is still in fine form."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"For the first few episodes, Jessica is a surprisingly passive figure compared to the others-at least until Gregory Sallinger, the season's big bad, sharpens the stakes."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,1,"Jessica Jones season 3 isn't exactly going out with a bang, but it is bright enough to illuminate the darkest corners of the MCU just one more time."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"While most of the stories boil down to slightly different lightsaber duels, the unique visual style of each story that feels like a natural fit for Star Wars manages to transcend the flat storytelling."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions Season 1 delivers quite the adventure across the galaxy. It's an anime anthology that truly emulates a wide variety of styles over the course of the season.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Are all 9 episodes bangers? Nuh uh. But for every weird story about a twin brother who has to piledrive his sister's chest because she went evil, you get a darling tale about a robot Jedi."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions season 1 review sees just how the new anime series adds to the existing franchise in new & exciting ways.
Star Wars: Visions,1,Visions brings whole new worlds to the franchise that just feel different from anything we've seen before.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"...opens the possibility of a richer, more creatively challenging and diverse Star Wars, even if the actual results only even out to a solid three stars."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If you've ever wondered what it'd look like to have Stormtroopers invade a Japanese village just as a wandering samurai shows up to save the day, this is the anthology for you."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"It brings with it the potential to develop some of these stories in an expanded way, perhaps on TV or even in film. Dreaming costs nothing! [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Wars: Visions,1,This anthology series provides a unique Japanese perspective on the Star Wars universe that feels both fresh and familiar.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Overall, Visions is an interesting and unique take on Star Wars."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"For an anthology, Star Wars: Visions is remarkably consistent in its quality. There are no flat-out bad episodes in the bunch, though some are stronger than others."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"The draw isn't really the stories as much as it is the way they're told, with frenetic energy, intricate art, and plenty of surprises along the way. It's a worthy experiment done well."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Highly recommended if you have a spare 10-20 minutes and fancy a little bit of Star Wars, or a little bit of anime... or especially if you fancy a little bit of both!"
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If you're a fan of anime and a fan of Star Wars, this is the sweet spot."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"In working with three of Japan's best anime studios, the largely American Star Wars franchise we've known all these years has been given an oh-so-enjoyable refresh."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions is a fantastic set of shorts that allows fans the opportunity to see their beloved galaxy through the eyes of some of anime's best creators, but the stories don't quite match the visuals in quality or originality."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"'Visions' is by far the boldest step that 'Star Wars' has taken in many years. Maybe ever, in fact."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If Star Wars under Disney has been mostly about staring at the rearview mirror, Visions shows what the saga could be if it dared to draw outside its margins. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Happily, this new series of 15- to 20-minute animated shorts produced by some of Japan's most respected anime studios is a lot more interesting than your typical blandly stylised Star Wars animation."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Most impressive. The anthology series explores the Star Wars universe like we've never seen before. The animation is gorgeous and the action is insane (lightsaber battles!). Fans of the Force will not be disappointed. [Full review in Spanish]
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions is a triumph to behold. Something that every Star Wars fan must watch yet everyone can enjoy. There are no limits in this show and that perfectly embodies the anime spirit.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"""Star Wars: Visions"" ain't canon, it's heart."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions champions the notion that there are heroes scattered all over the galaxy.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"That ""Star Wars: Visions"" is, finally, more of a pleasant diversion than a really fulfilling experience isn't a factor of running time or talent."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions looks cool as hell, but deep down, its greatest admiration is for the beating heart that has kept the galaxy far, far away ticking for generations."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions is wonderful, a pleasure to watch from start to finish, even if it does tend to lean on the same subject matter from one anime short film to the next. But Visions' over-reliance on Jedi stories is more than fair."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"The inevitable result, of course, is for each episode to feel like a carefully wrought and promising pitch for an ongoing series - just so many pilot episodes, elbowing each other for pickup."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If Star Wars films are going to keep edging closer and closer to shonen anime anyway, they may as well let the masters have a turn."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions represents some of the best work the medium has to offer.
Star Wars: Visions,1,This series brings an entirely new feel to this universe. The vast array of art styles and stories will have fans needing more.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"This original anthology broadens the fandom's understanding of Lucasfilm's franchise without relying on famous faces. From the animation to the dubbing, Star Wars: Visions shines brightly against its star-lit sky."
Star Wars: Visions,1,Star Wars: Visions is an expansive and beautifully made series tying together the beauty of anime and the beloved world of Star Wars. A must for fans of both.
Star Wars: Visions,0,"While some episodes have good elements, overall it's just too uneven. It also doesn't feel enough like Star Wars. But kudos to Lucasfilm for trying something different."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions consists of nine stand-alone shorts, with the best providing a fascinating wedding of that far-away galaxy to imagery and themes rooted in Kurosawa's films."
Star Wars: Visions,1,What better way for Star Wars to expand its horizons than to return to its roots - and trust the next generation of filmmakers from whence it came? It's the circle of life.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Visions, in its wild swings and vivid reconceptualizing of the universe, is freed from the obligations of canon, and in so doing becomes one of the most exciting pieces of Star Wars media we've seen in years."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"If this is a sign of LucasFilm's ethos going forward - more experimentation, out-there storytelling and outside ideas - it can only be a good thing, even if that is just limited to the world of animation."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Gone are the complex storylines and loaded questions about who is related to who and how this character came to this planet. It's about the simple story - good vs. evil, and the journey that leads a hero to victory."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"There is no shortage to the beauty that exists within Visions, offering nine unique short films presented by seven different studios, each clocking in between 13 and 22 minutes."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions, the franchise's first foray into anime, is a promising start."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"The collection of nine episodes is the Star Wars we all know and love, but one that grants a refreshing new experience to viewers like myself, who are looking for something different."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"""Visions"" plays like a creatively-driven and infectiously enthusiastic tribute to ""Star Wars"" from a diverse array of artists who have a genuine affection for the source material."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Whether you're a Star Wars veteran or a newbie, there's plenty to enjoy in the fun, breezy entertainment Visions packs into nine short episodes."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Visions creates new tales, ones that yearn to be explored further down the line. They work as stories on their own terms, but each is strengthened by the fact they're divorced from the wider Star Wars mythos."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"A show that is in constant conversation with Star Wars as a whole, reimagining the franchise through seven unique visions that celebrate what makes it special while delivering some of the most exciting stories we've ever seen in the galaxy far, far away."
Star Wars: Visions,1,The series lovingly evoke the familiar imagery of the hyper-referential Star Wars canon.
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Star Wars: Visions makes it abundantly clear there's no fixed format for telling a Star Wars story, and no limit to what that story can be if there's a great storyteller (or storytelling team) behind it."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Nine unique and creative takes on Star Wars lore. Fantastic animation, even if some of the stories fall flat."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"Without a weak episode in the bunch, Star Wars: Visions is a breathtaking addition to the Star Wars universe..."
Star Wars: Visions,1,"All nine short films aren't going to appeal to everyone, but there's still plenty to love about the ambitious Star Wars: Visions, even if you're not a fan of anime or the franchise itself."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,You won't be missing much if you give this season a skip.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The cast of the series is very diverse, but the storyline itself is only intermittently progressive."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Full of enjoyable action, mostly enjoyable characters and a simple plot that's great to see unfold."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"After a terrible first season that swung wildly and lamely, a deeply revamped Marvel's Iron Fist... finally packs a real punch."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Iron Fist's second season is infinitely more aware of the property's inherent narrative snagging points than the first, but rather than avoid them altogether, it makes a valiant effort of actually trying to mold them into something."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Much like our hero, it's clear that the series still has its share of growing pains to work through, but Season 2 at least marks a step in the right direction."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,Everything you hated about Iron Fist season 1 is gone and the remaining elements are tightly reconstructed into a superhero thriller that ups the ante for every Marvel television franchise.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Iron Fist undergoes a night and day transformation from season one to season two. It feels like two entirely different shows thanks, in large part, to Metzner and Barber."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,This season should have been appropriate titled Iron Fist Season 2: An SJW Redemption Story. AKA: We're sorry we tried to sell you a white dude doing kung fu because clearly only Asians can do that.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"The character evolution celebrates canon, yet overwrites it. And not in reaction to backlash but in spite of viewers capping the potential."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Without the weight of exposition, Iron Fist seems unbothered."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"This season is very character heavy, but the action sequences are exhilarating to watch. The energy Jessica Henwick and Finn Jones bring to these scenes, as well as their chemistry, really gives this show a breath of fresh air."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The show has taken on a new tone, a slightly altered title sequence, and improved fight sequence editing, which is great. However, it's immediately apparent how much is impossible to change."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"If the first season was like a superhero show that wandered into a family drama, then the second season gets better by being a superhero show that wandered into a family drama."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"I am a person who wants to watch more Iron Fist. It's shocking, I know. I still don't really believe it myself. It took time to get there - to the end of the eighth episode, ""Citadel on the Edge of Violence,"" in fact."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Has Iron Fist improved at all? The short answer: Kind of?
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,The problem: Danny Rand is just not compelling enough to carry his own show.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Marvel's efforts to improve upon a poor start are appreciated, but Iron Fist season 2 doesn't do enough to bring Danny Rand out of his hotbed with mediocrity."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"To its credit, the idea of Colleen being the real star of the show isn't an idea ""Iron Fist"" doesn't seem to hate."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"In addition to improving upon numerous first season flaws, Iron Fist brings in strong ties to its comic book roots in season two."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Season two is miles better than the first season. It's actually even mildly entertaining at times. But Iron Fist's biggest problem persists and there's little getting around it.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Congratulations to Iron Fist, which just leveled up from unwatchably bad to merely boring."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,[Iron Fist] fails to punch through in satisfying ways and ends up being another middling entry in what has been a disappointing year for sophomore runs in the Marvel universe on TV.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"The second season of Netflix's ""Iron Fist"" is a swift counterpunch to last year's weak debut of Marvel's mystical martial artist."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"It doesn't blow the MCU status quo out of the water, but the action here is capable and entertaining - and they keep the set pieces loose and fun in a way that feels like a good fit for this character and world."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Its lead character doesn't deserve top billing, and maybe never will. So until Daughters Of The Dragon becomes a reality, we'll keep checking out Iron Fist for the rest of the fight card."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"If the remaining four episodes are at least at this level, this is easily the most improved Marvel Netflix season and could stand as one of the best overall."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist still feels like a show in search of an urgent reason to exist, beyond the obligation to serve as one part of an intellectual property quintet that periodically intersects for team-up mini-series."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"If you are one of the approximately six people who didn't groan at the first season of this plodding, dull headache of a property, good news: You will also not hate the second one."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"A willingness to laugh at itself grounds the show, making it feel more human, especially when so many other parts of it strain so hard to be taken seriously."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"After seeing the first six episodes, this is what I got: the sophomore season is in fact better than its original outing. The fight choreography has had a marked improvement and the flow is significantly more fluid and the cinematography feels smoother."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"...Iron Fist is a straight-up chock-socky beat 'em up, and that's fine."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"If you tapped out during Season One, Season Two is definitely worth a revisit. Its better, less clunky, moves at a fast clip, all the characters are now established and ready to kick ass and chew bubble gum."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Yet drastically improved action sequences...just aren't enough to salvage Iron Fist, let alone keep general audiences interested."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Iron Fist is still a mess of comic book and kung fu clichés, but the later episodes of the second season show its potential to actually tell a good story."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Despite its struggles to be interesting, there's a workmanlike quality to the series' second outing that's admirable, if not entirely successful."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"After watching the first six episodes, I'll admit, Iron Fist season two left me hungry for more."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Season 2, with its 10 episodes, is faster paced, and its revenge plot more straightforward, leaving room for character development - even if that character isn't Danny Rand."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist Season 2 marks an improvement over its well-derided freshman run, but still lacks punch."
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"A massive improvement in virtually every way that matters. A new showrunner, a new fight coordinator... all help tremendously, along with better villains, a more focused story, and a willingness to put the show's supporting cast to better use."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Iron Fist's sophomore season isn't able to right the many wrongs from its first. Don't waste your time on this one.
Marvel's Iron Fist,1,"Basically, Iron Fist heard all the complaints about Season 1 and was like, ""I'll show you!"" And then it did."
Once Upon a Time,1,"Season 7 got off to an admittedly bumpy start, depositing us as it did in a new world filled with largely new faces, while even the familiar ones weren't quite (yet) the characters we had come to know and love."
Once Upon a Time,0,"As fans of the series, we don't want to add Once Upon a Time to the list of shows with disappointing final seasons, but we can't see even an unlimited amount of fairy dust in the finale changing things for the better."
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
Once Upon a Time,0,"The curse in Hyperion Heights feels a bit too forced while the alternate lives of Regina, Rumple and Hook seemed a bit uninspired and, honestly, not all that interesting."
Once Upon a Time,1,"We love the characters, but we aren't married to them because what we love most is the story, and boy howdy, do we have another story ahead of us."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
Once Upon a Time,1,"With a new location and characters, the show is returning to its former glory."
Marvel's Runaways,0,Their lazy symbolism made the show a miss for me.
Marvel's Runaways,1,Season 3 does a beautiful job of wrapping up stories in a way that makes the ending satisfying while also dropping a few clear hints of things that could have been explored.
Marvel's Runaways,1,"Wisely, Runaways doesn't waste time in starting to tie up those loose ends."
Marvel's Runaways,1,"Whilst the third and final season of Runaways is not thoroughly developed, it's a bold and poignant farewell that's tasked to reattach the dangling threads left from last season, while still admirably introducing a spellbinding new menace"
Marvel's Runaways,1,"The chemistry within the ensemble - the playful banter, as well as its kookier elements - make this third season of Marvel's Runaways a distillation of what's always been fascinating."
Marvel's Runaways,1,This is when Runaways is at it's best - when the team is working as a team.
Marvel's Runaways,1,"The best part of Runways' third and final season is its finale, which feels like faint praise -- but never discount the value of going out on a high note."
Marvel's Runaways,1,[Marvel's Runaways] were a quality start to an already action-packed season with the promise of greatness.
Marvel's Runaways,1,"It's incredibly rare to see a show address and internalize a critical dressing-down and make a hard pivot for the better, but that's what Runaways does."
Marvel's Runaways,0,"It's as though Runaways knows it should be a show about the instability and intensity of being a teenager, but lacks the courage to engage with those stakes."
Marvel's Runaways,1,"Season 3 of Runaways is everything that makes the show great, turned up to 11. The result is quite often moving and generally a lot of fun, but will nevertheless leave viewers with a bittersweet taste in their mouths."
Marvel's Runaways,1,"Runaways has been at its best, and remains at its best, when it's able to slow down and fully explore the intersection of teen drama and superhero show."
Star Wars Resistance,1,"Half-way through a season all the arc-plot begins to bunch up, and the last few episodes are genuinely engaging. It's worth a watch, but perhaps revisit the other animated shows first."
Star Wars Resistance,1,"In the rare case that Star Wars Resistance settles down to focus on a basic, specific story, the show genuinely shines, hinting at what it always could have always been."
Star Wars Resistance,1,"The premiere had a very good balance of comedic moments, character drama and tension. All the comedy worked very well - even Neeku's brand of comedy worked and I was fairly impartial to him throughout the first season."
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"The noirish feel of old Hollywood fits the show perfectly, and between the developing mystery and deepening relationships, this season is off to a great start."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"It was fun, but maybe a two-hour premiere loaded down with so much table-setting and story setup wasn't the best way to kick things off."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter remains one of Marvel's strongest TV properties.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is back for more with a second season, and it's clear that the trend of awesome, complex female heroes will keep on gaining momentum."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"After just one episode, Peggy and Jarvis' interactions continue to be sharp, entertaining and the show's strongest asset."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"I for one, wish more of television would take the leap that is Agent Carter. At this point, I'm following her wherever she goes."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Where the two hour premiere really kicked off was at the introduction of a strange atomic energy called ""Zero Matter."""
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Like last summer's Ant-Man, Agent Carter finds a way to make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"All the additions made to Agent Carter season 2 benefit the series, but in the end the show's success is still rooted in Hayley Atwell's central performance, which only gains more texture as she spends more time with the character."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,These first two episodes were pretty fun. And they didn't mention Captain America once!
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter's two-hour premiere has set up yet another mission that has already proven to be even more exciting than last season's involving Howard Stark and Midnight Oil.
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,[The setup is] opting for beats so trite that they feel like they're coming out of a spy parody.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter has set up a second season that could prove to be even better than its first -- which was solid in its own right.
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"The first two episodes of Season 2... feel more like pieces of the larger mega-franchise puzzle, and that's not its only problem right off the bat."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"The main plotline, with Wilkes, Whitney and Isodyne, is a really cool one and Peggy's dynamic with all of these characters in Los Angeles is really strong."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"Agent Carter is just far enough removed from Marvel's grand plans that the show can afford to take risks. This dual premiere doles out some clunky exposition, but it also builds a compelling foundation for a strong season."
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,Agent Carter returns tonight with its second-season debut to remind us that ABC has a powerful Marvel superhero worth praising anew.
Marvel's Agent Carter,1,"What I loved most about the very strong return of Peggy Carter was that we wasted no time debating her abilities, watching her trying to please others, or eradicate sexism."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go."
Alias,1,"Alias actually got better as it wound down in this season, and the show was allowed to give us a satisfactory wrap-up."
Alias,1,"Sadly, Alias jumped the shark by going ahead with the fifth season. But for fans of the show, it was nice to actually see the show have a final episode that wrapped things up. Too often, television shows just die in the corner with no farewell episode."
Alias,1,The contrast between this mundane dimension of Sydney's life and her athletic international intrigues was genuinely fun to see.
Alias,1,The final scene brought the season full circle.
Alias,1,"Alias is back to its roots with this episode -- great storyline, fast-paced action, the Rambaldi texts coming back into play, and some great character dynamics from previous seasons are all on display."
Alias,1,"ABC's delicious spy thriller, which returned last night for its final run, calls for a pulp goddess, and Garner is a natural."
Alias,1,"As a big fan of Sydney, Jack and the gang, I thought they went out the right way and have to give praise one last time."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Behold live history... A meta composition, a documentary on the documentary of the original idea: to find new The Beatles material for The Beatles. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"As a document of the breakdown of the Beatles, Get Back seems to exist for posterity rather than enjoyment."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"We dont see the Beatles break up in this documentary, but after eight hours we feel as if weve seen the beginning of the end."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Casual and obsessive fans of the band alike will appreciate the sheer volume of new material in Peter Jackson's epic-length docuseries.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"""After watching the nearly eight hours of this documentary, it's obvious that that image of the Beatles of that year was completely distorted, to say the least"". [Full Review in Spanish] -Letras Libres -"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson adds so much freshness, it almost feels like this band hasn't been covered..."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"After sitting through this saga from end to end, it feels as if you've just spent a week in a room with the Beatles."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The footage has been meticulously restored; it looks and sounds like it was filmed yesterday. The result is uncanny. It feels like a dream, a magic trick, a work of time travel science fiction."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"With a 8+ hour running time, this isn't a doc for the faint of heart, but stick with it and there's magic to be found along the way."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Parts of this were featured in the 1970 doc, but not in this way and with this much authenticity. It's pure electricity."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The Beatles: Get Back is, in the end, the consummate hangout movie."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson and his editor Jabez Olssen whittled, but still ended up with an eight-hour megadoc divided into three parts. In the process, they've dispelled accepted wisdom about the band, deepened the context of their chemistry and showed the act of creation."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Taking on something this ambitious is truly something to marvel at, and Peter Jackson could not have done a better job of bringing this priceless footage back to life."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"I can't help but feel that Peter Jackson could have trimmed an hour or so from the series. At the same time, I can't think of a scene I wish I hadn't seen: You need the hours to fully convey this peculiar stage in the Beatles late history in its full..."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"What is revealed here is a set of cumulative portraits that shed light not only on John, Paul, George, and Ringo but on all of us. This documentary tells our story as much as theirs."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Get Back is transportive television, a mind-blowing flashback that might be long, and at times uncomfortable, but is ultimately the best chronicle ever of the creative process."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"All three episodes reveal numerous candid moments -- some of which hilariously highlight the fact that even if you're the most successful band in the world, you're still never far from slipping into Spinal Tap territory."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The genius of these films, though, is the genius of the songs, which, wonderfully, we glimpse in creation. A chord will be hit -- not quite right. Go on, lads, try again, you've almost got it. They always did."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Being reminded that they were, quite simply, a group of young (devastatingly young) men rather than gods is part of the pleasure of Get Back, a way of reconnecting with their essential humanity."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Getting to see this session together -- the band all enjoying working and jamming, even if they were at their end -- is beautiful and is well worth watching all 7+ hours to experience the magic of The Beatles."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"If you want to go back in time to January 1969 and just hang out with The Beatles and see what that's like, there is nothing that comes closer to this experience than Get Back."

The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Please, Peter Jackson, release all sixty hours and give us that wonderful Christmastime."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"For super-fans like me, it is compelling viewing, but for those who enjoy the group's music but aren't interested in listening to dozens of versions of individual songs, it is best consumed in moderation."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"While it may seem a daunting prospect for those who are more passing fans of the group, there is a wealth of material to be invested in for the die-hard fans offering a fresh perspective on the tales that have been widely told over the years."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson can't keep the Beatles together, but he does provide revelation."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The Beatles: Get Back is clearly a labor of love for director Peter Jackson, but it plays as one of the clearest forms of fan worship there ever was, letting the band members act and speak for themselves."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"For some viewers, the cinema verité aspects will be a turn-off -- not everyone will want to hear this many takes of ""Don't Let Me Down""-- but it's partly the carving out of musical form that makes Get Back compelling."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"The Beatles: Get Back only truly comes to life when the eponymous band performs, and it happens far less than you might want over the course of 8 hours."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"In Peter Jackson's hands, this three-part documentary is too long and winding for all but the biggest Beatles fans, but it's also fascinating, funny, and as sad as watching a marriage implode."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"With mischief, fun, and boisterous musicality, The Beatles manage to simultaneously bring consternation to the establishment, and spread total joy. If that isn't The Beatles at their best, I don't know what is."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"As a viewer you're not sure whether to feel like you are intruding on conversations that perhaps you shouldn't be party to, or that you have by some magic become the fifth Beatle."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It doesn't retell history, it just cleans it up, but only so we can see it more clearly. Each episode is magnificent, and the overall picture is pristine."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,I felt like a teenager watching his idols... and I can't even consider myself a Beatles super-fan. [Full review in Spanish]
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"As someone who saw the Let It Be movie when it came out in 1970, I was fascinated by this opportunity to revisit the Fab Four in 1969. I wasn't disappointed. This is a remarkable, uplifting experience and an opportunity I'd long considered impossible."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Everything you could possibly have hoped for.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The final spine-tingling concert, which marked the last time they performed together in public, is a poignant moment that marked the beginning of the end of the greatest story in music history."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"An intense, tedious exercise, at times euphoric but always revealing. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Won't quite change the narrative around The Beatles's dissolution, but it does recast the Fab Four's death throes in a much more complex, and often unexpectedly joyous light."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Get Back is a wonderful blast from the past. A closer look into musical legends doing what they do best, knocking down old myths and putting their craft first in while being in the center of the turnmoil that was the end of the 60s."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Peter Jackson builds tension and suspense with the simple device of an almanac and a chronological narration. [Full review in Spanish]
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Peter Jackson's eight-hour recut of Lindsay-Hogg's voluminous footage does the impossible -- transforming it into a bright and colourful celebration of friendship, music and the sheer joy of playing that music with friends."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,It's easy to get swept away in awe of The Beatles: Get Back. You're offered an opportunity to sit in with some of the finest musicians of all-time in an intimate way that's not always captured in a rock documentary.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"You end up liking them as people much more. Well, I did anyway. Instead of pampered egos, you meet frayed late-twentysomethings who have had too much too young and can't really cope."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It is better, at almost eight hours long, than it would have been at two. It is better as a kind of slow cinema, in which we are imperceptibly tugged along by a narrative thrust so mild it might seem imagined."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Beatles enthusiasts will find much to chew over in Jackson's lengthy, fascinating three-part documentary - and I might even return for a second look. Several times I thought I'd give up on it. I couldn't. It was, after all, The Beatles."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's odd to watch: You see them coming together, these songs, take by lumpy take, but still you can't shake the feeling that they arrived fully formed, direct from Beatle heaven."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The Beatles: Get Back series helps shift our understanding of who The Beatles were.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"A funny thing happens on the way to a break-up in ""The Beatles: Get Back,"" the new Peter Jackson documentary - something close to transcendence."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Next to The Beatles Anthology, this is the greatest Beatles documentary I have come across. To see the Fab Four get together one last time and make hits out of nothing (even what would be future solo hits) is something that I will cherish forever."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,An essential work. [Full review in Spanish]
The Beatles: Get Back,0,Seven hours of boredom that test the beatlemania of the most devoted beatlemaniac. [Full review in Spanish]
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"An immersive, ambitious and refreshing documentary. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Rapturous.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Monumental, the Mona Lisa of rock documentaries, a staggering, towering technical and artistic achievement."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,I'm not a Beatles fan -- I'm an opera buff -- but it hooked me. I was fascinated.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's hard not to be fascinated by not only watching the Fab Four at work (and play), but also seeing them complain about the catering and discuss the previous night's television - and that's before the ennui and seeming fear and loathing really kick in."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"What Get Back lets the viewer experience is the invisible work that may not seem like work, as it slowly transforms even the faintest inspirations into art."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The fact that it goes on for so long may seem like the show's major bug at first, but after a while, you realize it is actually its greatest feature, and a true, generous gift."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Get Back is the noble kind of nostalgia project. It rises to the unenviable task of offering new insights into one of the most documented music careers of all time.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's a terrific documentary portrait, butstrangely, it might have benefitted from there being somewhat less of it."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The Beatles: Get Back is a landmark in documentary filmmaking...While there's a lot to get through, there's a lot to love about what Jackson's team has accomplished."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"""You're drawn in by the intimacy and the candidness of it all...and you do get a real feel for them as personalities...it's fascinating watching them fall apart in real time. """
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Jackson's promise of the joy is here.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"If you thought they emptied the vaults for that Beatles Anthology decades ago, you would be wrong. There's a whole lot of new Beatles goodness to be had with this masterpiece."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Director Peter Jackson has done a public service in bringing this daunting project to Disney+ in a three-part, eight-hour series."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Director Peter Jackson has pored over 70 hours of footage and found eight that reflected the joy of the band members in their creation.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Their music brings back rushes of nostalgia and admiration, but the best thing is - here they are, four young men at their peaks of creativity as one, fresh, young, mop-topped and engaged with one another."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Peter Jackson's documentary The Beatles: Get Back is just shy of eight hours long, divided into three parts, and it's mesmerising, yes, but also quite the schlep. It's a mesmerising schlep, in short."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"For any student of musical history, Get Back presents the kind of fly-on-the-wall access and insight into why the band subsequently broke up that's pretty irresistible, even if it's perhaps better consumed in smaller bites as opposed to one great gulp."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"If you know and love the group enough to get excited by learning about their creative process, and by witnessing it in real time, this new documentary is made for you. And for me."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,What often makes Jackson's edit so touching is the love that underpins both their tense exchanges and their tender ones. Especially revelatory is the way John delights in making Paul laugh.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Get Back is a bit like those five-CD reissues of a classic album, containing a jumble-sale of outtakes, live tracks and sundry stuff tenuously connected to the main event. Approach with a critical eye."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Thanks to Peter Jackson for passionately working 4 years to show The Long and Winding Road to Come Together and Get Back to where they once belonged.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"For fans these moments are priceless: candid, unflinching looks at the group's personalities and the creative process."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"This is a fly on the wall documentary about a family, with the intimacy so intense at times you almost feel like you should look away or stop eavesdropping. Almost."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"New fans and diehards alike will revel in the carefully restored images of the Fab Four as they bring such classic tunes as ""Get Back,"" ""Don't Let Me Down,"" and ""Let It Be"" to life in the studio, culminating in the famous Rooftop Concert."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,This documentary will make you feel like it's 1969 again - in a good way.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"These three feature-length episodes are some of the purest documents of the creative process, the musical equivalent of Michelangelo discovering the sculpture that was always in the block of marble from the start."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"For the group's most dedicated scholars, though, Jackson's Get Back is a fitting, expansive interrogation and celebration of their waning days."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"""Some films are about the journey. Some about the outcome. Peter Jackson has proven to be a master of giving us both."""
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Only four men knew what it was like to be a Beatle, and ""The Beatles: Get Back"" is as close as you or I will ever get to knowing how that felt."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"While there is so much here to discuss and debate and digest, what Peter Jackson has done is not so much 'correct' the narrative as provide a wider perspective."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The Beatles: Get Back gives Beatles fans more than enough of what they might be looking for in this intimate chronicle of the band's recording sessions and rehearsals in London in January 1969.
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Is it incredible and fascinating to witness the footage in Peter Jackson's ""The Beatles: Get Back"" doc-series? Hell, yes. Is it fascinating to watch the unfocused, directionless 6-hour-plus version of this meandering documentary? Not, really."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The footage is amazing in its intimac y& you-are-there atmosphere - & the documentary is of four creative souls struggling against their legacy, talent and ... yes ... break up."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,The Beatles: Get Back documentary proves once again that Peter Jackson's meticulous approach to filmmaking is impressive but excessive.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,I can think of no one other than the Beatles whose rehearsal crumbs are still delicious five decades after everyone else's leftovers have long passed their expiration dates.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Joyous, tedious, euphoric and fab, ""The Beatles: Get Back"" feels like a documentary made yesterday rather than 52 years ago..."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,You are witnessing unalloyed genius at work.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The film's accumulation of quirks and delights and boredom and exhilaration becomes more than fascinating; it becomes addictive.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Like Smaug's cave in Jackson's interminable ""Hobbit"" movies, ""The Beatles: Get Back"" is full of an astounding amount of treasure, and wading through it all will wear you out."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's so crisp, so vivid, so real."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Take all the films and interviews with the Beatles and put them off to the side. This is the most informative and illuminating record of what these men were like and of the nature of their interaction.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson is already talking about an 18-hour director's cut, and all I can say is, don't leave me standing here. Lead me to your door."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Jackson's docuseries features touching moments filled with laughter, soul-shaking music and incredible inspiration."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Even the dull moments crackle with creative energy.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It solves a little of the mystery of how these four lads from Liverpool achieved what they did, without taking away any of their magic."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Any future assessment of the band and its members will have to measure up against the people we see here.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"An immersive, in-the-moment chronicle of a generation-defining band in the act of creating, offering an up-close look at the quartet's alchemy."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"There is a point, about five hours in, when the prospect of hearing another ramshackle version of Don't Let Me Down becomes an active threat to the viewer's sanity."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Did it need to be almost eight hours? Absolutely not, but Jackson isn't going for brevity here."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,Clearly the director has a way with boys in the trenches.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,All of it is utterly compelling.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,You can feel Jackson's love and care in every perfectly restored frame.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"A work of huge affection and accomplishment, sure to put a smile on the face of every Beatles fan. But be warned, there may be some grimacing and yawning and worse along the way..."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"The sound has been impeccably revived, and every new outtake of a classic Beatles track feels like Jackson recovering some kind of lost artifact."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The Beatles: Get Back rocks!
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"""The Beatles: Get Back"" is an astonishingly up-close and engrossing view of Paul, John, George, and Ringo and their creative process."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"One of the most entertaining, compelling and important chapters in filmed music history."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Roger Ebert used to say that no good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough. ""The Beatles: Get Back"" is an interesting test of that premise."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"Much as professional photographers will take countless shots of the sky before capturing lightning, Peter Jackson's The Beatles: Get Back on Disney+ asks hours of immersion before giving up its miracle moments."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's fascinating to see them take the germ of an idea and massage it into fruition. It shows the camaraderie, the experimentation, tension, tedium and talent it takes to mold a thought into a song."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"What Lindsay-Hogg preserved on celluloid and what Jackson wants us to see, throwing all this never-before (or seldom) seen footage at us -- is their bonhomie, their good humor and musicianship and mutual support, even at what became ""the end."""
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Clearly in an act of self-parody, Jackson has transformed what was initially supposed to be a two-hour film into a three-part series that is nearly four times longer than originally intended."
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"A hypnotic treat for music scholars and Beatles megafans. But even with the absorbing undercurrent of suspense around the band's fate, Get Back is still eight hours"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It might rival The Beatles' entire catalogue for runtime, but Fabs fans will wish this wondrous mega-doc went on forever"
The Beatles: Get Back,1,The Beatles: Get Back features the greatest band in music history making magic in the final moments even as we know what's happening.
The Beatles: Get Back,1,"It's like finding a box of old photographs, or hearing a story that shows how much your aunt and uncle really did love each other, or how cool your mom was."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"I would suggest listening to the Pete Rock & CL Smooth tracks that each episode is inspired by - this provides context and it's quite a refreshing way to watch a show - you bump the song and then watch the episode, not many shows have that element."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"I absolutely loved this season. I just wish it wasn't so dark in some places, and by that I mean literally so dark in parts I couldn't see some of what was going on"
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"'Luke Cage' takes a step forward in its second season, that overcomes the first one. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"The one character that is disserviced is Cage himself, but even then a lot of episodes in the middle he's fine. Overall, a strong entry in the MCU, just not a great one."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"A great, great season, that really puts the focus on Harlem this time around."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage Season 2 isn't easily watchable, but it is enjoyable for the most part, and he remains the most consistently written and utilized character in the NYC centred Marvel universe."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"[The] second season may or may not repeat that feat, but it sure packs a lot more punch."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Your 11th grade English teacher is proud that you care about the show's themes. With all the subtlety of one of Luke Cage's punches, the show beats its messages into the audience."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"That's a close metaphor for season 2, in that a prominent adaptation of a beloved comic property invites more scrutiny, and it's a shame it doesn't deliver."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,This saga of the families is enveloped in a sweet cocoon of one the best television show soundtracks I have ever heard.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Non-fans might get antsy with at least the first four episodes. But when the show gets cooking it is a good time, fighting crime while winking at our celebrity-obsessed age."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Electrifying.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,The show takes its time establishing its style and re-introducing its characters.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,This cast is as beautiful as they are charismatic.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"It doesn't always succeed at its lofty aims, but it's far more audacious and distinctive because it explores the knotted reality of the characters' humanity rather than treat them as mere symbols."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"For Coker and company, listening to the criticism about the show's weaknesses has meant answering that call by digging deeper into the characters, using them to highlight the different ways that we all struggle to wear the right face."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"They try to cram so much into those episodes that even potentially interesting storylines turn into a slog, and Luke's journey goes from the understandably rage-filled chapter that we see in every hero's story to a chore."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Misty is a force throughout the entire season. A cop so close to turning vigilante, I found myself holding my breath during a lot of her scenes... It's an incredible journey."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Bloated, disheveled story but a super soundtrack and performance by Reg E. Cathey."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"It takes a season for Luke to find some sense of certainty, for better or for worse. The next step of his journey may be the most fascinating. But it could have come a whole lot sooner."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"You may already guess what season 2 of Luke Cage has ""fixed"" over its predecessor. Namely, it handles its villains much better."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"I'm really digging Alfre Woodard's performance as Mariah this season. Now that we're seeing her at her lowest point, Woodard is mixing in some great desperation and anxiety into her typical arrogance."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,I was pleasantly reminded how delightfully cheesy and goofy the show can be.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Much of this new season grapples with crime and other issues within the African American community, not really how the community reckons with outside forces and racism."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Broken into its constituent parts, Luke Cage's narrative elements are all fantastic in theory-and in many cases, the season's stories weave together wonderfully."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"The season premiere, surprisingly, is directed by Lucy Liu. But [the first two] episodes seemed a bit underwhelming."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"From the performances to the directing to the fight choreography, every nut and bolt of this narrative has been tightened down."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"if you told me that Luke Cage's second season would just be 13 hourlong episodes of Mike Colter washing his hands, I would probably still tune in."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,One of the key visuals in Luke Cage has always been a character wearing the crown. That's fitting as Season 2 seizes it in the best Marvel Netflix season yet.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Judging from the second season's carefully paced opening, with unresolved family tensions quivering in all directions, it seems this show won't be making the same mistake twice."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage Season 2 is an enjoyable mixed bag, depending on which of the series' elements you're into the most."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"The visual style and kinetic, music-driven fight scenes from season one return, and while there may be a few more scraps than the show necessarily needs, the writers make sure to bring some creativity to Luke's predicaments."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"As it is, though, season two is an improvement on the first, delivering enough powerful set pieces and rich character development to satisfy the fans across its 13 episodes."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"[It] is lots of fun in places and compelling throughout, but is conscious of just how fraught its storylines are."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,It's a step up from other recent Marvel/Netflix shows when it comes to a memorable villain with season-long objectives.
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Luke Cage might be bulletproof, but the character's eponymous Netflix series looks weaker in Season 2 -- not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage, though? The Hero of Harlem? He's the social conscience of Marvel's Netflix universe."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,Perhaps the worst offender yet of the Netflix/Marvel drama approach of filling up a 13-episode bag with only three or four episodes' worth of story at best.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"While season 2 is far from perfect, it not only avoids the sophomore slump, it surpasses season 1 through a relentless focus on how both its heroes and villains are defined by their families."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Some of these scenes are watchable, good even - but they kill the pace during the series' already-flabby hour-long episodes, and leave you longing for a simpler story without the padding."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage Season 2 is slowly but deliberately paced, taking the time to delve deeper into what motivates both its protagonists and its antagonists."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"This may be one of Marvel's strongest seasons to date, but the Defenders franchise needs to shake off the formula and move onto something fresh."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage Season 2 satisfies like a warm, rousing crescendo. If you can find the beat and stay in tempo, Mike Colter will pull you along for a smooth ride."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"All while maintaining the same stylish, musically, and culturally rich presentation of the original series...this could be one of the best TV shows of the summer."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Marvel-Netflix-Industrial-Entertainment-Complex: I concede. Luke Cage Season One seemed laden with untapped potential. It has in fact been tapped. Season Two is a 13-hour mic drop. Fandom-trolls, you may stand down."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Season 2 of Luke Cage makes the show more of an ensemble project, and it's exactly what it needed to continue capturing fan attention."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"There is a lot good in this second season and as far as Netflix MCU shows go, this may be the best sophomore season we've gotten. Still, they need to work on figuring out pacing..."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"While Mike Colter and Alfre Woodard deliver solid performances, there simply isn't a compelling story worth exploring."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage isn't a bad show, but it definitely falls short of its obvious inherent potential."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage's second season marks the darkest point of the Netflix Marvel shows to date, and will have you rethinking your definition of 'good' and 'evil' once you reach the ending."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Luke Cage could now remove any superhero elements almost entirely and still function as a series.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage is alternately bland and thrilling, formulaic and insightful."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Luke Cage Season 2 breaks the Marvel Netflix curse -- it's managed to deliver a second season that surpasses the first.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,This self-discovery unfolds through a series of dramatic choices that keep the narrative ticking along at a surprisingly brisk pace.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Woodard's transformation from reluctantly-corrupt politician to queen of Harlem crime is Season 2's outstanding breakaway performance.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"...More important than that, it's a season where the women around him are discovering themselves."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Luke Cage season two is a solid watch that suffers from the same problems as all the Marvel Netflix shows do.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,Luke Cage Season 2 does everything the first season did right and tightens up what didn't work.
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"The more self-assured second season has some truly great moments, especially from the ultra-charming Simone Missick, but there's still way too much filler in between."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,"Luke Cage returns for a complex, emotional season that increases the stakes while also suffering the same pacing problems of every other Marvel/Netflix show."
Marvel's Luke Cage,1,This season is by far one of the most well-written and fully developed plot lines we've seen yet from a sophomore Marvel TV series.
Glee,1,"A show that can boast moments of genius, memorable performances, great (and sometimes so-bad-they're-good) songs, impressive voices, and fun scripts among its achievements."
Glee,1,"Considering how wildly uneven Glee has been for, well, most of its run, the ending turned out to be pretty darn near pitch-perfect."
Glee,1,Those who have stuck around are witnessing something genuinely transgressive for major network primetime television. It'd be challenging to think of another network series that has celebrated the beauty of difference better.
Glee,1,You can't look at TV as it exists now and not see the influence of this slushie-soaked teen dramedy about a band of singing misfits. Glee was never perfect. At times it was even bad. But it accomplished something.
Glee,1,"Like its characters, Glee became a star only to fall back down. Then, when no one was looking, it slowly but surely found itself again, never having stopped believing that it could."
Glee,1,"With all of its disasters and missteps, all of its triumphs and showstoppers, Glee was ultimately, and above all else, something special. I am so very glad that I -- that we -- could be a part of it."
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
Glee,0,Perhaps Ryan Murphy's most ruinous decision was to go all-out in his embrace of victimhood.
Glee,1,It was a well-earned love letter. But it was also a reminder of the potential that the series once had and that it only intermittently lived up to.
Glee,1,"At a time when so much highly esteemed television equates excellence with darkness, cynicism, violence, and despair, there's something to be said for sweetness and light. Glee was a sweet-hearted show."
Glee,1,"If this two-hour opener is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. The bigger the challenge, the more the bow bends and the more potential you create to do something amazing, after all."
Glee,1,"Despite the ""meh"" of the return of Puckerman and Santana et al, by the end of the premiere, I found myself smiling along and almost happy that Glee is back."
Glee,1,"The two episodes that marked the series' final season premiere were actually, dare I say it, good... ish. Yeah, let's go with ""good-ish."""
Glee,1,"It wouldn't be Glee without dreaming big. Or it would, but it would be season five. So far, I prefer season six."
Glee,0,"Although it's taken a step in the right direction, the show's previous ubiquity in high school pop culture leaves it as a pale imitation of its former self in the sixth and final season's two-hour premiere."
Glee,1,"Allowing the series to get back to its roots and accentuate key original cast members [feels strangely liberating.] Those dynamics should make this closing number worthy of attention, despite Glee's continued irritants and excesses."
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work is a gently amusing production that provides more nuance and charm than expected.
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
Monsters at Work,0,An unremarkable journey through ideas we've already seen done better before.
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
Monsters at Work,1,"The new-and-improved Monsters, Inc. company's slogan is ""It's laughter we're after,"" and this joyful series follows through on the fictional company's goal."
Monsters at Work,0,"Rather than lending fresh new eyes to a world first established two decades ago, Gannaway and company play a Greatest Hits montage of Monsters Inc. references."
Monsters at Work,1,"""Monsters at Work"" isn't on the same level as the two feature films, but it's miles ahead of the likes of ""The Return of Jafar"" or ""Kronk's New Groove."""
Monsters at Work,1,"Monsters at Work will have to do more to surprise audiences who are already familiar with this world, but by looking at the unsung heroes of the workplace, it has an interesting and fruitful avenue to explore."
Monsters at Work,0,"Bafflingly, it's a workplace comedy. Note to Disney: children don't go to work."
Monsters at Work,0,It feels like a long wait at times. The first two half-hour episodes (the only ones of the 10 that were available for review) are extraordinarily slow.
Monsters at Work,1,"If you love original movies and were expecting a third, ""Monsters at Work"" might be a bit disappointing. But if you can still appreciate the world-building."
Monsters at Work,1,"Like the movies, cuteness and wit combine for good children's programming."
Monsters at Work,0,"It's great to see Mike, Sully, and Cecilia again, but the nostalgia isn't worth it. Monsters, Inc. was something special. Monsters at Work may look like its inspiration, but it sure doesn't feel like it."
Monsters at Work,1,"Monsters at Work isn't just balancing its humor, it's also balancing the new cast and the old one... it's a great balancing act to pull off, and the first two episodes indicate a promising journey ahead."
Monsters at Work,1,"The show doesn't deliver belly laughs, but it nimbly slides into the ""Monsters"" timeline and cleverly builds on a particularly fertile Pixar concept."
Monsters at Work,0,Any hope that the Pixar charm would rub off on a Pixar show like Monsters at Work doesn't pay off in the first two episodes.
Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work brings the funny while managing to keep the Pixar spirit on screen.
Monsters at Work,0,"Has the feel of a weekday afternoon cartoon that was churned out quickly to capitalize on a successful property, featuring lesser versions of the franchise's characters."
Monsters at Work,1,"A smart, sassy and surprisingly effective update of the now 20-year-old minor animated classic."
Monsters at Work,1,"This is a solid effort, even if it doesn't quite shimmer like your top-of-the-line Pixar favorites."
Monsters at Work,1,"Combine them with some well-executed slapstick set pieces that evoke the two movies without feeling like rehashes, and the early episodes set up the foundation for a solid all-ages comedy."
Monsters at Work,1,"The first 2 episodes of Monsters at Work are an endearing, nostalgic & charming workplace comedy perfect for the whole family"
Monsters at Work,1,"A wonderful little workplace comedy for younger audiences. While it never quite captures a true Pixar charm, it's an enjoyable series that feels like both an organic follow-up, and love-letter to the original movie."
Monsters at Work,1,"It may fall short of Monsters, Inc.'s quality, but as facile family viewing it does what it needs to do to entertain its intended audience."
Monsters at Work,1,"Monsters At Work looks good and has some good moments, but it doesn't come close to being as good as Monsters, Inc. It was nice to see Goodman and Crystal back as Mike and Sully, but the series doesn't give us enough of them to make it worthwhile."
Monsters at Work,1,Monsters at Work is a wonderful addition to the Monstroplis mythos. It's filled with plenty of laughs and memorable new characters that are sure to excite fans new and old.
black-ish,1,"Black-ish crammed a lot into its series finale... But it was the last scene that really sold the episode, offering a reminder of a show that consciously sought to raise the bar for the network sitcom."
The Wonder Years,1,"This warm reimagining of the nostalgic comedy transports us to a very different region of the 1960s: the Deep South, reminding us that coming-of-age stories are universal."
The Wonder Years,1,Saladin K. Patterson's script never loses the series' core: a family drama. [Full review in Spanish]
The Wonder Years,1,"""Wonder"" is a wonder in the world of TV reboots."
The Wonder Years,1,To get attention for reviving a classic is easy; to do it well is very hard indeed.
The Wonder Years,1,"There's a lot of promise here; the child actors are great finds, and the adult cast... evince a roundedness that you hope will mean story lines dedicated to their characters, too."
The Wonder Years,1,"As its heart, ""The Wonder Years"" is your standard-issue network sitcom but with a bit of an edge and it's all-about diversity here - there was none in the original - which is the point."
The Wonder Years,1,The show suggests some of the relationships of the originals without copying them.
The Wonder Years,1,"Warm, lovely, and as suffused with gentle nostalgia as the original, this remake of the iconic late-'80s series recaptures the same sentimentality yet adroitly slips in modern cultural commentary."
The Wonder Years,1,"That's the real reason I enjoyed the new Wonder Years reboot so much. Here, I'm not the one trying to imagine how people like me would fit into a narrative set at such an important time."
The Wonder Years,1,"Regardless of how the new Wonder Years turns out as a financial/Nielsen bet, it's no cynical ploy. It's very funny, rather charming and... well, good."
The Wonder Years,1,"The Wonder Years is a trip down memory lane, but it casts a fresh and welcome eye."
The Wonder Years,1,"The Wonder Years boasts a common unifier to which we can all relate: growing up. It's sweet, sensitive, and heartwarming."
The Wonder Years,1,"Put it this way: if the original Wonder Years was the coming of age story of the Arnold family, then this Wonder Years is aiming to tell the tale of the coming of age of our America."
The Wonder Years,1,We're confident that it'll follow its own comedic path and become one of the better network comedies.
The Wonder Years,1,"The new Wonder Years has moments of absolute joy and levity, but it also proves that history continues to scream at us from the past."
The Wonder Years,0,"The old show was escapist, sure, the new one is not, but the inevitable question is why a network remakes a show in a way that largely ignores the charms of the original."
The Wonder Years,1,"This look back through time leans more intense toward joy than sorrow. Don Cheadle's gentle narration as adult Dean sets and maintains that tone, although Dulé Hill's calm, fatherly presence... solidifies the show's kindness."
The Wonder Years,1,"Whether the series can sustain the charms and deft balance that its pilot exhibits remains to be seen; still, just getting out of the gate this looks like one of the fall's most appealing shows."
The Wonder Years,1,"A brand new series that is technically a reboot but is thematically so much more. The writers deftly juggle two opposing ideas, arguing that the good old days weren't good for everyone, while offering the same nostalgia that we loved about the original."
The Wonder Years,1,"Both nostalgic and a painful reminder of the violence visited upon Black Americans, this Wonder Years capably walks a narrative tightrope in its premiere."
The Wonder Years,1,"Thankfully, this version of ""The Wonder Years"" makes you want to follow this kid on this journey of realization and understanding."
The Wonder Years,1,"Credit the pilot of The Wonder Years 2.0 with this: With brainpower that's rare for a contemporary network sitcom, it makes its characters' relationships feel vivid and real against the backdrop of changing times."
The Wonder Years,1,The series manages to invoke nostalgia for bygone days while also remaining relatively clear-eyed about the challenges of that period... and it accomplishes this while delivering the cozy appeal of the best family sitcoms.
The Wonder Years,1,"A decent enough remake, but one that lacks the groundbreaking verve of the original and pulls its punches a bit."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Its refreshing to find a show promoting the values of honesty, friendship, and bravery in a package the whole family can enjoy."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"As Mr. Benedict, Hale infuses his trademark nervous energy with sincere care for the children, always sure to find the humor and heart in each scene."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Marvelous adult ensemble and cast of diverse talented children are a delight. First half of season is charming, with story of very smart kids, but adult problems get nasty."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,Manfredi and Hay aren't afraid to create a series that both praises the intelligence of children while also admitting that being a kid is weird and confusing.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Hale may be brilliant as the narcoleptic genius, but the child actors are the real heroes, especially the scene-stealing Kessler."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Rather than being something for children with a few jokes the grown-ups will appreciate, it has the same youthful joie de vivre as a film like Moonrise Kingdom, but with the vivacity and energy of Spy Kids."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Brightly coloured, bold and bravura in its execution."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,The production design is richly detailed and the cinematography has the crisp look of a fashion magazine meets fantasy paperback.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,Has all the components a great kid classic needs.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"The unique story and fantastic performances help elevate The Mysterious Benedict Society, which suffers from an abundance of whimsy and quirkiness."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"The uniquely identifiable characters come to life thanks to wonderful casting choices and compelling, yet familiar, dialogue."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Smart without being overly precious, but is just weird enough to keep kids' attention."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Within the growing set of shows about kids asked to save the world, ""The Mysterious Benedict Society"" stands out, and might itself save a rainy weekend for curious kids sometime this summer."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"What could have offered children a chance to understand the historically unprecedented aspects of the internet age they live in, made the young fish conscious of the water they swim in, is left simply as a romp."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Even though the children's performances fell a bit short, I hope that they'll grow on me throughout the series. For now, the promise of Hale's dual roles and seeing how future scenes will be presented is more than enough to convince me to keep watching."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There could be potential here, but not enough to build real enthusiasm."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Based on the novel by Trenton Lee Stewart, and with a quirky tone set by producer-director James Bobin (Flight of the Conchords), it should captivate its intended audience."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"The first two episodes have a start-and-stop energy, with more tests leading to more tests, and it gets more and more tedious."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,The characters are distinctive and appealing enough to keep The Mysterious Benedict Society engaging even in its slower early stages.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There is potential in here, though, especially through the committed performances from the cast. But right now The Mysterious Benedict Society needs more mysteries and fewer answers."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"Everything about it is superb -- its acting, storytelling, and wonderfully immersive dystopian world."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,1,"A fun and quirky adventure series for the kids, which offers up Blyton-esque intrigue, fantasy and whimsy. Disney shows they've finally found a way to make non-IP brand kid's fantasy work, and work well!"
Just Beyond,0,Not at all memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]
Just Beyond,1,I would have loved this series if I saw it when I was ten. They're kids' stories. They're Twilight Zone-esque things.
Just Beyond,1,"Tweens who like being a little spooked will enjoy Just Beyond, and the well-done stories make this a great family viewing candidate too."
Just Beyond,1,"Stine helped craft the storylines for each episode, which means his unique magic touch can be felt in every episode."
Just Beyond,1,Just Beyond displays a warmth and sense of humor that makes up for the episodes' lack of scares.
Just Beyond,1,"It's certainly solid family viewing for niche audiences of 10 to 12 year olds, but teens raised on more mature fare are way beyond what's offered here."
Just Beyond,1,"With each episode running for around 30 minutes, most ending on a twist, and virtually all containing a thinly veiled lesson that'll resonate with the target audience, there's something for everyone here, even if only one episode truly stands out."
Just Beyond,1,"A great throwback to kids shows of the 1990s and early 2000s, feeling right at home with classics like Goosebumps, So Weird and Round the Twist. While there's not much here to offer for older audiences, its key demographic should absolutely LOVE it."
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"Louder and Prouder will provoke heartwarming nostalgia for parents who grew up on Penny Proud and her friends and family, while inspiring a new generation with life lessons sprinkled with hilarity."
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"From the animation style to the social media references to the very casual queerness, these writers make sure we know that we’re not in 2001 anymore. And it mostly works!"
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"Certainly should stand out, as much as anything for bringing back a proud African-American family that has two happy parents, on equal (or greater) financial standing with any animated family on Disney Plus."
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"Even if you didn’t see The Proud Family the first time around, you’ll enjoy The Proud Family: Louder And Prouder. It’s a funny family sitcom with well-drawn (and written!) characters."
The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,1,"While it is too early to tell whether or not it truly lives up to the legacy of the original series, the two-episode premiere largely signals that Louder and Prouder is on its way to becoming a revival series done right."
X-Men,1,"With the mutants in the show consistently being treated with mistrust and hostility, it's easy to see themes of prejudice and intolerance that we deal with in our own society."
X-Men,1,"Its success paved the way for future Marvel cartoons, and it is considered to be the greatest X-Men animation of all time."
X-Men,1,"It's got quite the legacy, and, like many of the other shows on this list, I can attest to its success in introducing these characters to a whole new generation."
X-Men,0,The fifth season isn't worth watching.
X-Men,1,"The show always left me wanting more, wondering what happened next. It wasn't so much on the storyline of the week but rather how events tied into the bigger picture and throughout seasons and, even, beyond."
X-Men,0,Frankly - and it pains me to say this - it would be better if the final season of X-Men: The Animated Series didn't exist at all.
X-Men,0,"Winding down, this series just wasn't as entertaining at the end as it was in the first few seasons"
X-Men,1,"We've passed the threshold beyond which the animation for the show went sharply downhill... but the sheer novelty factor of it, the spectacle, makes it worth a watch."
X-Men,0,The series fizzled to an end.
The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!,1,"A must-see for any self-respecting Marvel fan, the series captures the Avengers so perfectly it could even teach the MCU a thing or two."
The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!,1,"The high points of Season 2 far exceeded those in Season 1, and even the weaker episodes weren't bad so much as simply flawed or underdeveloped."
Big Shot,1,I hope it gets renewed for a second season. A hidden gem!
Big Shot,1,"This is inspirational sports TV, we all know where this is headed, but Big Shot will give you a good time while getting there, we count that as a win."
Big Shot,1,"Big Shot is a slightly enjoyable sports drama anchored by a solid lead performance, but the acting can't rise too far above the writing. At least not yet."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
Big Shot,1,"Big Shot is more of a family drama than you might expect, and a very appealing one at that."
Big Shot,1,"It does such a great job of setting the character up, but two episodes in I'm still waiting for this world to develop."
Big Shot,1,"The charismatic cast certainly helps. Stamos may never win an Oscar, but he's a reliably likable TV presence who makes it easy to root for a high-strung bully who's trying to rebuild his life."
Big Shot,0,"It's a mess, and it doesn't even have the good grace to be a fun one."
Big Shot,1,"Big Shot is a perfectly adequate show ostensibly targeting a teen audience for Disney+. The cast makes the most of awkward moments, but the lingering feeling three episodes in is that no one is sure exactly which show they're on."
Big Shot,1,"The show certainly has some flaws... But as an engaging family drama, and one that illustrates the obstacles girls face when they try to achieve in sports, Big Shot is mostly a winner."
Big Shot,1,"A solidly-written show with a fine cast, and John Stamos doing his usual great job in the lead."
Big Shot,1,"If Big Shot is able to find its footing, it's thanks to Stamos. He renders a believable performance-Marvyn's discomfort at this major life change eventually transforms into subtle acceptance and joy."
Big Shot,1,"Stamos is the ultimate utility player, capable of delivering dry wit and sweet sentiment in equal measure. Stamos is the ultimate utility player, capable of delivering dry wit and sweet sentiment in equal measure."
Big Shot,1,Big Shot has the potential to be a great show if it continues to grow episode by episode and ultimately offers something unique to the genre rather than rehashing stereotypical stories.
Big Shot,1,"If you want adult drama from your TV coaching, Beartown will still have to suffice, and Big Shot won't fill the Ted Lasso-shaped comic hole in your heart. But I like the potential here and hope the show develops a stronger sense of what niche ."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Big Shot,1,"It's a sweet, sunny series -- if not as endearing as Disney+'s The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers."
Big Shot,0,"Big Shot, while perfectly amiable in most respects, often fails to sweat the details in the way that a tough coach would demand."
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
Big Shot,1,While it's easy to see what [Big Shot] is up to ... it's the softer touch that catches you off guard.
Big Shot,1,"Big Shot is, perhaps, Disney Plus's biggest surprise yet. A small teen sports drama that packs a powerful punch with huge heart, wonderful moments and great messages - and it's bolstered by an absolutely terrific cast."
Big Shot,1,Big Shot is another basketball redemption story but needs time to see if it will set itself apart from the films that came before.
Big Shot,1,A surprisingly fantastic show. John Stamos is a gem and a talent!
The World According to Jeff Goldblum,1,"It is, essentially, a show about everything that occasionally does nothing. But it kinda works. Why? Because it's Jeff Goldblum, that's why."
The World According to Jeff Goldblum,1,"While the titular host of the show might not be everyone's cup of tea at first glance, the excitement and wholesomeness of Goldblum can melt many a curmudgeon's heart."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"Marvel's Hero Project is an uplifting and inspiring show for all the family, celebrating the amazing achievements of phenomenal real-life heroes."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"While the Marvel branding threatens to overpower, the stories on each episode are strong enough to stand alone."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"But while the series isn't as prominent as The Mandalorian or Falcon and the Winter Soldier, it is a wholesome, charming show grounded in the real change that a spectacular kid can make."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,Marvel's Hero Project is exactly the kind of show we need right now: a wonderful fountain of positivity that acts as a perfect palate cleanser amid all the negativity of the world.
Marvel's Hero Project,1,Hero Project's best attribute is that it lets the kids being profiled shine through.
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,Marvel celebrates the young superheroes walking among us.
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"These human-interest stories are undeniably powerful at times, and the series is reasonably well-made."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"It's not entirely suited for a 30 minute format, and you can often feel the strain, but it's never not uplifting."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"While [it] doesn't include the kind of superheroes we're used to seeing battle bad guys on the big screen, the series could motivate both kids and adults struggling with problems in their lives and communities to start working toward solutions."
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"A show easily putting a smile on anyone, reminding us of the immense impact that heroes have in our lives, whether in comic pages or real life. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Marvel's Hero Project,1,Talk about inspiring - this show proves that not all heroes wear capes. Truly powerful and a must watch for the whole family.
Marvel's Hero Project,1,"The bulk of the episode then focuses on the youngsters and their support groups. This is where the true heroism of their story comes through and where you'll feel your heart melt a little more, each and every time."
Turner & Hooch,1,"There's crime, there's action and there's even a love triangle. It makes quite the package, we reckon!"
Turner & Hooch,1,"You may not have asked for a Turner and Hooch series, but it may just be the inoffensive, low-stakes series you were looking for when you need something easygoing."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Fans of the original may mine some nostalgia from this new take on the story but beyond that, this series should end up in the pound."
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Unfortunately, at least in these first three episodes, the show is too caught up in recreating the squabbles between Turner and Hooch over and over again in new scenarios."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
Turner & Hooch,1,"It's fine. And it is always good to see dogs getting work. Though, babe, you're not credited anywhere. You need to bark at your agent about that."
Turner & Hooch,1,We'll be honest here: We're recommending Turner & Hooch mostly for the dog.
Turner & Hooch,1,"Fans of canine chaos, exasperated Captains, puntastic episode titles (A Good Day to Dog Hard, Diamonds are Furever) and a little, low-key potential lurve should find plenty to enjoy here."
Turner & Hooch,1,"There's a good bit of action and a lot of humor, both involving Hooch and the various people in Scott's life. However, there's a lot of room for improvement."
Turner & Hooch,1,"Given that many shows struggle to find their footing early on, Turner & Hooch finds its footing very quickly, and I'm excited about what the future holds for the series."
Turner & Hooch,0,"I'm not even complaining when I call Turner & Hooch a forgettable, one-joke series. It's hard to know what else it could have been."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Even if Hooch sits at attention like a good dog, after a few episodes of Turner & Hooch, it's hard to share that patience or loyalty."
Turner & Hooch,1,"Nothing feels dumbed down or muted, though the dog dilemma involving Hooch being thrust upon an unwilling owner feels like a questionable situation now instead of a light-hearted romp."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It's not very good, but I guess that means it's paying homage to the original."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It leans much too hard into the corny aesthetic of those kinds of lighthearted dramas, creating something too silly and childish for most adults, yet likely too old-fashioned for their own children."
Turner & Hooch,1,"While paying respectful homage to the original film and beautifully continuing its legacy (it's) not afraid to forge its own path. Plenty of laughs, great action set pieces and great characters make for an enjoyable buddy-cop series for all!"
Turner & Hooch,1,"Dog-loving teens may enjoy this show, which is relatively tame in most aspects besides the violence, but many will roll their eyes at the cheesy dialgoue and storylines."
Turner & Hooch,1,Cute family fare and an endearing dog.
Turner & Hooch,1,Turner & Hooch gets the reboot approach with Josh Peck taking over the leading duties but Tom Hanks's presence is still felt in the series.
The Right Stuff,1,"Overall, I get the sense that the entire ensemble cast is just finding its footing in this first season, and I'm eager to see where it goes in season 2."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
The Right Stuff,1,"The Right Stuff glorifies is our ability to overcome, excel and achieve not because things are easy but because they are hard."
The Right Stuff,1,"Insightful viewers can enjoy this limited series, but as a general piece of Disney entertainment it's also a fun and exciting adventure."
The Right Stuff,0,This series plays like a quickly-written nostalgia trip and nothing more.
The Right Stuff,1,"If you appreciate strong writing, acting, and cinematography, even in familiar settings, you'll likely enjoy the show."
The Right Stuff,1,"It looks great and the performances are strong, but it offers very little that's new to the overcrowded TV landscape."
The Right Stuff,0,These men deserve better than to be rendered as faceless characters living in the world of a run-of-the-mill TV drama.
The Right Stuff,1,"The Right Stuff is, by far, the best traditional drama on the streamer to date, but is this the right stuff for the future of Disney+? Not necessarily."
The Right Stuff,1,"This is Nat Geo's first original scripted series for Disney+ and it's a successful launch, pardon the pun..."
The Right Stuff,1,"The premiere proves that casting is key, and the talented group fit beautifully into their respective roles and offer a worthwhile peek inside the lives of these history-making Americans."
The Right Stuff,1,"It's 2020 and Google plus a quick trip to Wikipedia will tell you everything you need to know. But despite these obstacles, the eight-episode series is more often than not a compelling, inspirational drama that does its best to command our attention."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff makes a lot of expected choices and covers a lot of expected ground... this is not a NASA story that ever takes its eye off the white men at the center of its story for very long.
The Right Stuff,1,"Solely on its own merits, the series, a presentation of National Geographic, is a perfectly serviceable drama about a rococo period of American history."
The Right Stuff,1,"About as predictable as it gets -- which isn't exactly a deal-breaking knock against it. For those who already love the idea of outer space and the people who get to explore it, The Right Stuff should be straight up comfort food."
The Right Stuff,0,"The astronauts have little grain or complexity, beyond one or two single traits; they're network-deep portrayals -- at least those who register."
The Right Stuff,0,"The film is great, and it makes the weaknesses of the TV show stand out all the more clearly."
The Right Stuff,0,"A tepid eight-part remake, originally announced for the National Geographic channel but now airing on Disney+, feels more like underpowered soap opera."
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
The Right Stuff,0,The story crawls along incrementally without using all that time to let us know its characters as anything but the broadest of archetypes.
The Right Stuff,0,"Not only does this TV version of ""The Right Stuff"" not bring anything new to the table, but it has pretty much every bad habit Hollywood is currently trying to get rid of..."
The Right Stuff,1,"Where Staples' show really cooks is in the dynamic between the 7, in all their testosterone-fueled competition."
The Right Stuff,1,"A sprawling miniseries that utilises its 8-hour runtime to focus on the human elements of its story... a beautifully made series, if not slightly tedious in parts, and a worthwhile watch for people wanting something a little meatier out of Disney+"
The Right Stuff,1,"Phenomenal acting, a solid plot, side stories that keep you interested and not distracted, not to mention just how fascinating the space program is."
The Right Stuff,1,The Right Stuff is unexpectedly thought-provoking in its consideration of what America wants out of its heroes.
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
The Right Stuff,1,"As a dramatic series, it's phenomenal; it's frequently touching and just as thrilling. But as a show that could potentially usher in a new era of Disney+, it's even more exciting."
The Right Stuff,0,"Approach it simply as Hunky Young Astronauts in Love rather than a Wolfe adaptation... like the movie, it still can't find time to dedicate a full episode to NASA's test monkeys - and you might even be able to dispense with some of the disappointment."
The Right Stuff,0,"A blandly-cast, boringly-acted, dully-written, flatly-directed and instantly-forgotten bore."
The Right Stuff,1,"What it loses in momentum, however, this Disney+ series gains in its characterizations, offering a satisfying voyage back into the stories of the men at the center of the Mercury 7 space program, as well as the women that loved and/or endured them."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Any attempt to reboot The Mighty Ducks shouldn't be undertaken lightly. The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, unfortunately, tackles the franchise with all the grace and nuance of the Bash Brothers."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,The series should be inspiration for all of the misfits and disadvantaged kids out there to find their unique talents and make the most of them.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"With the episodes clocking in around the half-hour mark, you will likely breeze through this story and not feel the need to come back week after week. It may just be worth a binge once the whole season has aired on Disney+."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"The best thing ""Game Changers"" offers is how it unabashedly embraces the world it exists within, representing a seamless continuation of the movies even as it carries the ball - sorry, puck - forward for a new generation."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"While it's not as game-changing as the title suggests, these new characters are charismatic and fun, the story is familiar and comforting and it has enough heart to skate on."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Graham is a delight for kids and parents alike, striking a successful balance between nostalgia and novelty..."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,The kid actors are all pretty funny and the dialogue is just sharp enough to make even adults laugh.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Disney is banking on nostalgia and a love of sports dramas to get its new series over that hump, and the show is mostly charming enough."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"As a stand-alone TV series, Game Changers is serviceable at one end, lightly entertaining at the other. But as a TV sequel tethered to a beloved film franchise, it's a sweet, goofy and warm ode to a pop-culture touchstone."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"While its characters are engaging to watch, there's a lack of tension (so far) that holds the series back from standing out among similar underdog stories."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"This offers more proof, if it was ever needed, that Lauren Graham is America's greatest TV mom."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Just like the films that came before it, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers is an exercise in the familiar and heartwarming. It's not trying to break any new ground or win prestige awards. It's a simple underdog story, and a dang good one at that."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"These brisk half-hour episodes bring light-hearted, family-friendly laughs by offering younger viewers a band of relatable outcasts to root for... It all makes The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers a quacking good time."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Unlike the advent of the original franchise, this new series isn't a game changer. But it is a delight. And that's something to quack about."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,Tweens will likely enjoy the underdog story and watching the middleschoolers overcome obstacles. Grown-ups will probably wish this re-boot left them with more of the same warm fuzzies they remember from the original.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"The series captures the spirit of the OG films through this new motley crew, who are not exactly all-star caliber but still have plenty of heart."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Mighty Ducks viewers may well empathise with his reluctance as they, too, are dragged back to a franchise that perhaps isn't all it's quacked up to be."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Falling somewhere between being suitable for adults and perfect for kids, it's a very sweet, nicely crafted show."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"In its first episode, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers resembles its scrappy kids: uneasy on the ice and a little afraid to take shots."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Game Changers isn't epic enough to serve as a tentpole series for Disney+, but it is the sort of solid entry that helps establish the service as not just the house that Baby Yoda built, but rather the home of good clean fun, for parents and kids alike."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"While I was happy to see Estevez on screen, the character is flat and unpleasant, giving little explanation about his backstory until episode three."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,Game Changers is a wholesome entry into the Mighty Ducks canon that maintains the '90s-style earnestness of the original trilogy.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers is only OK, but that matches the pedestal upon which I place the movie. If you have more reverence, your disappointment might be greater."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Totally heartwarming, non-sugary and entertaining."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"It's a pleasant enough series, and a good one for families, who probably won't be as well served by the usual superhero fare."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,It's nearly impossible to not root for these underdogs.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Because it's a series, Game Changers has more layers than a film. While Alex initially insists they just play for fun, by the end of episode two Evan says losing every game isn't fun, ensuring this series will have some smarts to accompany its big heart."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"By subverting its source material's premise and keeping Bombay in the mix but not at its center, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers makes sharp, timely updates to the timeless story of ""good guy"" underdogs who just want to have some fun."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"In terms of crafting an entertaining, cheerfully lightweight show around this latest quack attack, the producers have largely achieved their goal."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,Game Changers reignites the magic of the Mighty Ducks franchise.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"The old clichés still work, even if just briefly, and the tension between having fun and trying to win provides enough thematic complication at the start."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Game Changers just shrugs that if the Mighty Ducks' strategy worked for three movies, it'll simply work again here."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"Like any rag-tag team, Game Changers is slow to start, but the potential is there."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Like the Don't Bothers - like the show itself, really - she's in there swinging, but doesn't score very often."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,he Mighty Ducks: Game Changers is just hitting its stride by the end of the third episode.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"It might be overfamiliar, but it delivers the underdog tropes you'd want from a Mighty Ducks series and that'll be enough for most fans."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,"An incredibly welcome and original reboot of a Disney classic franchise. Filled with the heart of the originals, and a whole fistful of added soul, it's a series that, so far, has something for old fans and new viewers alike."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,1,Game Changers has the potential to be a Cobra Kai level legacy sequel.
Welcome to Earth,1,"If nature's colors could glow more brightly, its sounds boosted with deeper bass, its depths plunged to terrifying bottoms, and heights shot higher, Will Smith and director and producer Darren Aronofsky are the ones to provide the jolt."
Welcome to Earth,1,"Without a doubt, this is a gorgeous and fascinating series, despite any limitations."
Welcome to Earth,1,"Much of what we're getting we would never see without a cinematographic advantage, but that's what makes so much of Welcome to Earth so mysteriously seductive: an invisible, or barely visible, parallel existence on which the show shines a man-made light."
Welcome to Earth,1,"Welcome To Earth finds one of the biggest A-list stars humbled by what he sees, hears and feels, and the fact that Will Smith gives himself over to these experiences is what makes the show a fascinating watch."
Welcome to Earth,1,[Welcome to Earth] an entertaining and educational time as we watch Smith travel to the far reaches of the world.
Welcome to Earth,1,"Enter Welcome to Earth, which allows Smith to explore the world with those who do so professionally, in what amounts to a cheerful exercise in nature programming for beginners."
Welcome to Earth,1,"The series was shot by a team of cinematographers and they're the heroes who make it thrilling, scary and generally eye-popping... I kept wondering why somebody felt the need to add an unnatural star-driven narrative to all of this natural wonderment."
Welcome to Earth,1,This could have been supremely irritating - a pampered Hollywood star getting to complete his bucket list on Disney's dime - were it not for Smith's immense likeability.
Welcome to Earth,1,[Smith is] a likable guide with a nice line in vulnerability.
8 Simple Rules,1,"It's also a heart-warming and optimistic reminder of how, in times of difficult or even traumatic change, family can provide us with the strength to keep going."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"Lizzie McGuire is still one of the most well-known and well-loved series from the Disney Channel, and for good reason. Lizzie was the everyman -- she was all of us, and we identified with her hard."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"What I consider the best Disney Channel original program ever, Lizzie dealt with a myriad of middle school problems."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"There is no denying the magnitude of this one... While the show itself was a classic (but not without its problematic scenes), what came from it was even better."
Lizzie McGuire,1,"It seems silly to think that a Disney Channel show about an average, adolescent girl could have been powerful enough to leave you with a memory that you carry 12 years after the show... However, I do."
Lizzie McGuire,1,We get the adorable beginnings of Lizzie and Gordo's budding romance.
The Imagineering Story,1,Mild Disney docuseries reveals the reality behind the magic.
The Imagineering Story,1,"'The Imagineering Story' gives off that touch of magic that marks the house, marveling at its details. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Imagineering Story,1,An audiovisual and historical document about how disney built their collective imaginary and turn it in a several theme parks. [Full review in Spanish]
The Imagineering Story,1,"In many respects, the documentary drinks too much of the Disney Kool-Aid, self-mythologizing whenever it gets the chance. Yet, beneath the bias remains an interesting look at the detailed work that goes into the Disney Park."
The Imagineering Story,1,"More cynical viewers mindful of Disney's (the man and company's) shortcomings and capitalistic pursuits will naysay, but the series leaves viewers with the warm-and-fuzzies."
The Imagineering Story,1,"I had two feelings pulling at me when I was watching the first episodes of The Imagineering Story: ""Wow, this is fascinating!"" and ""Wow, is this boring!"" How can I have these two feelings simultaneously?"
The Imagineering Story,1,It's a little sanitized... and sometimes you'll wish it dug deeper into your favorite ride. But it's hard not to come away with a massive appreciation for the people who made these incredible theme parks possible.
The Imagineering Story,1,"Perhaps the biggest problem that The Imagineering Story has in its first two episodes is, in and of itself, a compliment: it's too short."
The Imagineering Story,1,"The Imagineering Story is enjoyably educational, especially for people who love to take toys apart to see how they work."
The Imagineering Story,1,"If you thrill to names like Mary Blair, Xavier Antencio, Yale Gracey and Rolly Crump, and go all wobbly over concept art, dark-ride models and pristine color footage of theme parks under construction, this is a series for you, as it is for me."
The Imagineering Story,1,"Learning about the ingenuity and hard work of the Imagineers still makes the show a worthwhile ride, even if you sometimes question the motives behind its construction."
The Imagineering Story,1,"For Disney world lovers, and even some cynics, is a feast of fascinating trivia and literal world building [Full review in Spanish]"
The Imagineering Story,1,"The Imagineering Story is more candid than expected. It's the first-hand accounts and archival footage that make all the difference, as the story of how these theme parks were created is often told here by those who lived it."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"It feels like a more mature version of a Disney Channel show, as Lahela encounters death and suffering, but grows (and grows up) in the process."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,Somehow the blend of medical drama and teenage growing pains really works.
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,Doogie Kamealoha feels like its own show - and anyone who hadn't actually seen the original series would never know different.
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",0,"Right now, Doogie Kameāloha, M.D. is a predictable show on many fronts, including its slavish devotion to the original program."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"By giving the show that space to find its own characters and stories, the show immediately starts off as a funny, family-oriented story about a kid genius that holds people's lives in their hands but also just wants to be a normal teenage girl."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"More than anything, it feels like a single-camera version of a Disney Channel sitcom, as bright, earnest, and heartfelt as its lead."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"If there are growing pains early on, they just lend themselves to the series' adolescent focus. After two episodes, Doogie Kameāloha M.D. and star Peyton Elizabeth Lee come into their own."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D. works largely thanks to its cast, specially the charismatic Lee, a young veteran of Disney television, playing Lahela with an effective combination of strength, vulnerability and charm. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"Aside from its disappointing lack of care for the complex richness of of teen girlhood, I genuinely enjoyed watching both of the episodes provided for review."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"Created by Kourtney Kang, Doogie Kameāloha, M.D., executes a fine balancing act between playing to an older audience's nostalgic appetites and simply telling a good, admirably personal stand-alone story."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"The result is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing fun for the whole family, a rare show that the whole whānau can gather round by completely entranced by."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"Already a well-established member of the Disney family, Lee provides the secret ingredient that gives this ""Doogie"" its kick, convincing in her mismatched roles balancing teen troubles with the familiar medical-drama scenarios."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",1,"There's just enough in Doogie Kamealoha, M.D. to keep our interest and see how things develop."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Ultimately, the program is reasonably good fun for X-Men aficionados, but the reliance on past movie and comic references... blunts the appeal, as does the occasionally stiff animation quality."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Blame whatever you like- the blatant Wolverine pandering, the departure from tradition- but the interest just wasn't enough to continue the story."
Wolverine and the X-Men,1,"The question heading into the third part of the season finale remained whether they'd be able to pull it all together in an entertaining way that still felt logical. As it turns out, the answer is mostly yes."
Wolverine and the X-Men,1,"Where the series really succeeds is in its wide use of characters major and minor, all pulled from the comics."
Wolverine and the X-Men,1,"Though aimed at kids, Wolverine and the X-Men has enough depth to appeal to older fans of the popular Marvel Comics franchise as well."
Wolverine and the X-Men,1,Wolverine and the X-Men also succeeds in bringing the sheer variety of characters to life without making the show feel crowded.
The Muppet Show,1,"I'm struck by how much of the show wasn't meant to be comedy, but just an earnest celebration of theater and music with no punchline at all."
The Muppet Show,1,"Rib-tickling, envelope-pushing, zeitgeisty appointment viewing."
The Muppet Show,1,"Introducing a generation of kids to absurdist humor, The Muppet Show helped reshape comedy forever."
The Muppet Show,1,"The genius of The Muppet Show was that it was ironic without being cynical, sharp without being cruel, sweet without being sappy, anarchic without being too chaotic, timely without being dated."
Earth to Ned,1,"Though it gets off to a rocky start, it quickly becomes a quirky and fun series replete with candid, improvised, and entertaining conversations with celebrity guests and a vibe that hearkens back to Space Ghost: Coast to Coast."
Earth to Ned,1,"If The Muppet Show helped '70s America rediscover irreverent joy, Earth to Ned might be here to convince 2020 America that our world is worth saving."
Earth to Ned,1,"It's the strangest thing on Disney+ by a considerable margin and that's a good thing -- Earth to Ned has a personality and flavor all its own. You'll be begging to be beamed up, again and again."
Earth to Ned,1,It's the kind of thing many of us humans need to hear these days.
Earth to Ned,1,The series' sharp writing and top-notch puppetry make for a super-fun binge for fans of all ages.
Earth to Ned,1,"A worthy successor to Muppets Now, Earth to Ned's strongest asset is its cast of characters you can't help but root for -- which is good, because these goofballs really have no idea what they're doing."
Earth to Ned,1,"A meta-commentary on chat shows and an improvised comedy, it's silly but smart viewing that plays on different levels for different ages."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Earth to Ned,1,"Earth To Ned is weird, funny and actually heartwarming, a formula that's right in the Henson wheelhouse."
Earth to Ned,0,"If this was a regular network and the first shows landed with the thud that these do, there'd be panic and a mad hunt to recast."
Earth to Ned,1,'Earth to Ned' is way more fun than it has any right to be.
Earth to Ned,1,"An incredibly clever and irreverent late night talk show spoof, with something for audiences of all ages. It's as hilarious as it is heartwarming, and is everything Muppets Now wanted to be and so much more."
Marvel's 616,1,There should be enough material in the eight-episode first season to keep you occupied for a few entertaining hours.
Marvel's 616,1,"An absolutely wonderful look into the world of Marvel, touching on so many areas of the company that often don't get the showcase they deserve - from the mainstream to the absolutely wacky and absurd."
Marvel's 616,1,"The stories it chooses to tell turn out to be genuinely fascinating, whether you're a diehard Marvel fan or someone who has no idea what Marvel's 616 even means."
Marvel's 616,1,"For those interested in the process, this programming is definitely interesting, even if much if it feels as calculated and massaged as a corporate video or political ad in adding luster to the studio's image."
Marvel's 616,1,"It is a huge credit to the various people involved in this series, then, that Marvel's 616 is not just several hours of needless mythologizing, but an engaging series that finds new angles from which to appreciate the Marvel universe."
Marvel's 616,1,"Dedicated Marvel fans probably won't mind the series' reluctance to turn a critical eye toward the company, and it's clear that everyone involved is a Marvel true believer."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"I'd assume we'll get plenty more back story on Alice and Cyrus the genie, but so far I liked what I saw. Even with the few scenes they shared they had some nice chemistry."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,Wonderland stands on its own as a new and thrilling fantasy world to explore.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"If you are a romantic, you'll love Once in Wonderland. If not, expect a lot of eye rolling in between the good parts... But some flashes of wit, imagination, and goofy-but-fun action hint that it may end up being worth the ride."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"If over -the-top fairy tale stories full of true love and elaborate costumes aren't your cup of tea, you probably won't fall head over heels for Wonderland, but it's still worth giving a look. It's just that much fun."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Whether read as pure whimsical fantasy or a collection of deep ideas that'd been over-simplified into incoherent psychological symbols, Wonderland was a hot mess."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,It's all meant to be a paean to the imagination. Too bad the effects pry some of us out of our imaginations and into the tech lab.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Too much of the show is taken up with unnecessary contrivance. Yet, when the program works, it's surprisingly easy to get past all of that to the show's core, which is old-fashioned, family TV that's refreshingly straightforward about its aims."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"For this to work -- and right now, it looks like Oz during a shutdown -- Wonderland needs the sort of recognizable human types who drive ""Time."""
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Even moving nights, though, won't solve the problems of the thin story and artificial scenery."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,TV spin-off takes dark fantasy drama to another dimension.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is a disappointment, focusing more on the chintzy tableau of the candy-colored Wonderland than on giving its actors anything interesting to do there."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Wonderland is kind of dark, kind of confusing and only moderately entertaining."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"With the mothership's leads on a similar quest for a missing boy, Wonderland seems like an exercise in magical redundancy. This looking glass is cracked."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,The main storyline isn't strong enough and the incongruous peripheral elements just confuse rather than engage the viewer.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,Wonderland promises to be eye-popping. What about heart-rending?
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,Why borrow a classic if you're not going to do anything with it?
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"If the writers and the network are content and able to mirror Carroll's knack for dreamy digression, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland could be all that, and a side of magic cordial too."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,The flaws in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland appear to be fixable.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"The challenge of creating a successful spinoff is to give the new show its own identity while still reminding viewers of how much they love the older show. Once Upon a Time in Wonderland... does that quite well, suggesting it might even be better."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,I'd be happy to follow this White Rabbit just about anywhere.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,We don't know how they do it but the masterminds behind the ABC's hit magical drama Once Upon a Time have brought us yet another mesmerizing fairytale-inspired series.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"I can't help but believe that if this new series focused on the dark, foreboding tone in its asylum scenes, it could become a powerful, trippy 9 p.m. drama."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"As in Once, the computer-generated landscapes and creatures don't quite work - they look unworldly, but in a cheesy way."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,I've wished for a show that rows against the current of TV trends that I've grown tired of. And my wish came true! I just should have been more specific and wished for a better show.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"it's Alice who carries this tale, and it's good to see her again."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Ultimately, the story doesn't really matter because the characters are paper thin, and efforts to make Alice more than a damsel in distress -- she's a skull-crushing, tree climber -- don't really add much depth."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"If we could get high enough, maybe we could see some reason to sit through this Disneyfied pastiche of Lewis Carroll and ""1,001 Nights."" Or maybe not."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once you're in Wonderland, you might remember how dense and unfortunately dour life is there. As soon as you get there, you feel like you're ready to leave."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Alice's battles with various computer-animated and live-action threats are entertaining and, usually, rather witty, though her traveling companions, the White Rabbit and the Knave of Hearts, get most of the best lines."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"Compared with the original, Wonderland boasts a more streamlined story (at least for now) that's built upon an easier-to-understand quest: Save the boy; go back home."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,I'll give it 3.5 Tweedledees on a scale of 5 Tweedledums. Once Upon A Time In Wonderland is very nice to look at.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,Good family fun.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"The show's real power resides in Lowe herself, whose screen presence makes even the silliest bits of Wonderland work better than they probably deserve to."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,1,"The brief look we get hints that maybe they can pull of some magic in this other world. It looked, if ever so briefly, visually intriguing - tiny Alice, eating mushrooms and running amok, etc."
The Boys,1,"The Boys isn't saying much that's new in its third season, but it continues to bite deeper — and sharper."
The Boys,1,"The Boys is definitely not just thinking bigger and louder in season three; the result has been a more thoughtfully crafted, creatively rewarding series, without sacrificing the acerbic, outlandish qualities that earned its reputation on a TV landscape."
The Boys,0,"You finish each episode with a nasty taste in your mouth, not helped by the fact that so many of the characters are so ghastly you wish they’d all self-explode and put us out of our misery."
The Boys,1,"If it is nearly as character-driven and contemplative as this season was, we are in for a hell of a finale."
The Boys,1,"Season 3 of The Boys shows it's not running out of superhero serum anytime soon. Instead, it covers even more ground, bulging with gags, topical issues and ludicrous action sequences to create the most potently entertaining, eye-popping cocktail."
The Boys,1,The Boys‘ third season is the most balanced to date and had me hooked from the first episode to the last and will likely have you all hoping the fourth comes sooner than later.
The Boys,1,"The Boys is back for a depraved and pointed Season 3 as the superhero series expands its scope and history for a bloodier, more poignant story."
The Boys,1,"“The Boys” is consistently entertaining, but it could be so much stronger. For the first time, it almost seems scared to really unleash its true power"
The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 balances gore and irreverent, dark humor with surprising poignancy and depth. Said gore and boundary-pushing scenes never feel forced or gratuitous; they fit the show’s tone."
The Boys,1,"The third season of The Boys delivers in spades. It’s got more violence, more random musical numbers, more heartbreaking moments of despair, and more to say about the state of today’s affairs."
The Boys,1,"If The Boys wants to avoid becoming the very machine it’s mocking, it needs to drive its social commentary home and bring the Butcher v Homelander feud to some sort of irreversible conclusion."
The Boys,1,"The rollicking third season features more sex, drugs, lies, and carnage as the body count rises and the Boys figure out their next move."
The Boys,1,"Season 3 of the crazy superhero satire is more violent, funnier, and darker than ever before. And it features some unexpected plot twists and crazy performances."
The Boys,1,"It's still offensive, depraved, obscene and ridiculously violent. I loved it from start to finish... Each episode is a feast of twists, surprises, and intrigue that had me mercilessly glued to it, from the very first sequence. Full review in Spanish."
The Boys,1,This show is beyond nuts.
The Boys,1,"Many may find that The Boys is retreading already well-worn territory. However, I think there is still plenty of life left in The Boys, and a depressingly endless amount of American hypocrisy and depravity to skewer."
The Boys,1,"The Boys continues to be one of the best series on television. Its storytelling, visual effects, one-in-a-million actors, and non-conventional humor continue to prove why the series is a fan favorite."
The Boys,1,"If this season makes us feel more squeamish, that may be for reasons other than the exploding victims... Perhaps it's because the show has gotten very good at reminding us that our nation's reality is not so far removed from the one it depicts."
The Boys,1,"I found my self saying ""Oh My God"" more than I think I ever had. This show is absolutely demented… and Season Three is all the better for it."
The Boys,1,"It’s brash. It’s bloody. And if the boys wanna fight, you better let ‘em."
The Boys,1,"It’s a sturdily built season, but it might make you miss the show at its full strength."
The Boys,1,The emotional connections makes all the ultra-violence that much easier to stomach.
The Boys,1,The Boys third season is a terrific satirical look at our world. But I am unsure if I was ready to witness it right now.
The Boys,1,"“The Boys” returns for a third season of head-popping gore, dark humor and psychotic superheroes — and it’s a rollicking ride."
The Boys,1,"Crammed but not stale, “The Boys” retains its relentless style and continues to deliver a needed black eye to a genre that refuses to let go of our collective pop culture."
The Boys,1,"...feels like some of the most adept social satire of the moment. In part, that’s because society at large has just gotten so much worse that mildly watered-down Garth Ennis no longer feels much like humorous exaggeration."
The Boys,1,The Boys Season Three gives us yet another crucial representation of current American society and its struggle to become whole amidst all of the blatant untruths and bigotry that has permeated it since its origin.
The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery."
The Boys,1,Antony Starr (Homelander) steals every scene he's in.
The Boys,1,It’s tough to top the absurdity of the real world we live in but The Boys continues to reflect it back at us with a merciless accuracy. Sometimes it can hit too close to home / some of us haven't had enough distance from the real inspiring events.
The Boys,1,"The Boys remains creatively fearless and, for those with the stomach for it, a great deal of fun. As creative combinations go, like Homelander, that one-two punch looks pretty near unstoppable."
The Boys,1,"What The Boys does very well is take something ripe for parody and constantly escalate, much to the delight of its audience."
The Boys,1,"The Boys might be showing some cracks in its smart satire foundation, but there’s still plenty to enjoy in this crazy, bloody ride."
The Boys,1,"The way The Boys captures how futile the struggle to do and be good can feel sometimes, when the systems in place seem like they can never be fixed for the better, gives it a certain relevance to today that frankly it’d be nice to ignore."
The Boys,1,Amazon’s superhero satire reminds us to be careful who we call a hero.
The Boys,1,"Decapitations, drama and darkness await audiences in The Boys season 3."
The Boys,1,"The third season of The Boys is an insane, blood-soaked, and dick-filled journey into a twisted world where the superheroes are just as corrupt and monstrous as the government agencies that puppeteer them..."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
The Boys,1,"In a show packed with gratuitous violence, some of the deepest cuts are emotional."
The Boys,1,I still can’t believe what I saw – and I am very much enjoying the feeling.
The Boys,1,"As gleefully brutal as ever, with (slightly) more heart."
The Boys,1,"Spitting in the face of comic book genre fatigue, this third season goes further than expected, indulging in graphic violence and sexuality, showcasing an unafraid mentality in its tackling of issues and thematics."
The Boys,1,The words 'twisted' and 'in your face' barely touch what The Boys Season 3 attempts. This is superhero shock art.
The Boys,1,"The series has always been terrific at reflecting trends in the real world, its emphasis on the role of social media, branding, and celebrity in the modern world spot on from start to finish."
The Boys,1,"The DNA that has made The Boys both a critical and ratings success is all there in season three – the violence, the gore, the deep commentary on our current political and media landscapes . . ."
The Boys,1,"With this raging third season, 'The Boys' reiterates itself as one of the best original series on Amazon Prime Video. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Boys,1,"The entire season is a lean, mean stomach-wrenching machine that pushes the limits at every turn and is wickedly accentuated by scathing social commentary."
The Boys,1,"This season is chaotic, unhinged, and shocking. Antony Starr is on another level, as Homelander continues down his rage-filled path. The addition of Jenson Ackles as Soldier Boy is perfect, and this series continues to perfectly balance humor with action."
The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 isn’t quite as shockingly powerful as Season 2 — there’s no topping Stormfront, apparently — but what the show lacks in political satire it makes up for with nuanced character development."
The Boys,1,"S3 isn’t afraid to take things too far, and aims to make fans uncomfortable yet thoroughly entertained. The balance of seriousness, violence, humor, sex, grotesque, loving moments, and completely new elements–is a hit"
The Boys,1,Thanks to the final 2 episodes - which are very strong - Season 3 is definitely worth your time. But the first 5 episodes are very unfocused. Great storylines for the female characters. But Antony Starr is once again what really makes this show shine.
The Boys,1,"The acting and characterization is top-notch, and the gory fight scenes remain thrilling. While the satire is a downgrade in sharpness from Season 2, the story remains worth watching."
The Boys,1,"From the capable cast, the wonderful writing, and the well-crafted set and costume design (just to name a few things), The Boys continues to fire on all cylinders."
The Boys,0,"Three seasons in, the gag is starting to grow a bit old, as the satire gets weaker and more toothless and more characters vie for our attention while traveling down familiar roads."
The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 is pitch-perfect satire, and the wildest season yet."
The Boys,1,"The Boys knows to get the groove back by introducing some very violent or very sexual scene (sometimes both at the same time), (...) but maybe it's starting to reach the point of losing the element of surprise. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Boys,1,"Through it all, the moral murkiness and messy consequences are never less than compelling in a season that blurs the line between the good guys and the bad guys more than ever before."
The Boys,1,"Without giving too much away at this stage, season three just takes everything you love about The Boys and ramps it up ten-fold."
The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 premiere episodes are substantial, but they also bring back the trademark style of the show’s fun and lighthearted vibes that make it so enjoyable to watch."
The Boys,1,"The layers of this rotten onion unfurl themselves, and even after all the shock wears off, one can appreciate this show for being, on a higher level, cultural critique even outside of the superhero realm."
The Boys,1,"Kripke successfully maintains the series’ high caliber consistency with season three. “The Boys” continues its streak of anarchic energy, sardonic humor, and self-indulgence made all the more entertaining by its bursts of extreme gonzo violence."
The Boys,1,"With a slew of gripping Supe showdowns, a biting social commentary and even more compelling character arcs, Prime Video’s tentpole show keeps going from strength to strength, proving to be one of the most bold and creative superhero streaming titles."
The Boys,1,"The Boys Season 3 is taking it up a notch, in a way that feels almost too much at times and not nearly enough at others. In other words, The Boys Season 3 is very much The Boys and the show isn’t making any apologies for it, not that it has before."
The Boys,1,Amazon Studios has obviously given the production a budget worthy of creating gory/bloody masterpieces.
The Boys,1,"“The Boys” is a black comedy, an action extravaganza, and a vicious editorial all rolled under the same cape."
The Boys,1,Executive producer Eric Kripke and the show’s writers find new and inventive ways to freak us out.
The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 does what the Prime Video show does best, but pales in comparison to the tightly wound and exciting narrative arc from season 2."
The Boys,1,"Quibbles aside, I’m glad that as long as we must live in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, The Boys offers an oasis for everyone who wishes we didn’t."
The Boys,1,The Boys season 3 is back doing what it does best – balancing shock and gore with moving character development.
The Boys,1,"From the get-go, it’s clear that <I>The Boys</I> season 3 isn’t content to rest on its laurels and bask in the glow of its well-received second outing. The rubber meets the road quickly and loudly."
The Boys,1,"The Boys as a TV show is entering a rare territory, one where it has staked its own claim with the property and seems poised to exceed its source material in many ways. The Boys TV series has found where it can improve on its source, and it's done that."
The Boys,1,"With its third season, The Boys gives the middle finger to the rest of the streaming content out there and firmly establishes itself as one of the best shows on TV... comic book or otherwise."
The Boys,1,Don't let the calm status quo that opens the new season of Amazon's gonzo anti-superhero series fool you: it's a dizzying spectacle of gore and grim humor.
The Boys,1,"The Boys season 3 is bigger, bloodier, and more political than ever before. It is completely bonkers and filled with jaw dropping moments, shocking twists, and pure insanity. It doesn’t get much better than this."
The Boys,1,"An expansive exploration of power and what it means to have it. That theme amplifies quite a few character arcs, but Annie and Kimiko's journeys prove to be the Season 3 standouts."
The Boys,1,"The Boys remains the most depraved and delightfully unhinged series on TV, and while it tries to cram a little too much in, season 3 is a must-see and a great platform for the phenomenal Jensen Ackles to steal the show as Soldier Boy."
The Boys,1,"In some ways, by the end of the penis & cameo season, the purpose of the season (other than filling the catalog with interesting, quirky, crazy episodes) is unclear and perhaps a bit frustrating."
The Old Man,1,"It’s a simple cat-and-mouse premise, and the motivations are almost beside the point. The Old Man is less about the twists and turns of the spy genre and more of a showcase for Bridges and Lithgow, who are as good as they always are."
The Old Man,1,Nice to see Jeff Bridges in a vehicle that deserves him.
The Old Man,1,"There is plenty of tension, but the real pleasure here is watching an old pro allowed to just be in front of the camera and remind us how it’s done."
The Old Man,0,"The veteran actor does nuanced work as usual, but the FX series takes too many ridiculous turns."
The Old Man,1,"The Old Man is more captivating when dealing with universal real-world concerns than with its spy stuff, no matter that its slam-bang action is crisp and its twists and turns are energized."
The Old Man,1,"With danger always lurking, Bridges convinces us that underestimating this well-seasoned spy has deadly consequences, while the terrific Brenneman startles us."
The Old Man,1,"In the early going, The Old Man seems like a skilled but predictable shoot-'em-up... But as it unfolds, like an onion shedding bloody skins, it's apparent that every character has secrets and practically nothing is as it seems."
The Old Man,1,"A bold, wise series, with a knockout performance from Bridges leading the way."
The Old Man,1,Sometimes a series is so breathtaking and complex and smart that it blows your mind. FX’S The Old Man is one of them.
The Old Man,1,"Jeff Bridges is fantastic in The Old Man, as is John Lithgow. It’s a show that promises to parse what it means to become old, what’s lost, and also what is never, ever forgotten."
The Old Man,1,"On some level, The Old Man feels keenly aware of its limitations. Wisely, the series leans into the skill and grace of its cast, which also includes Amy Brenneman and Alia Shawkat in pivotal roles that grow more complicated as the show progresses."
The Old Man,1,"The spy genre is so well worn one would think there's not much new to be done, but The Old Man largely confounds those expectations, thanks to the stellar combination of Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow."
The Old Man,1,"Alas, you will get a sometimes frustrating story line that’s both complicated and, in some ways, simplistic at the same time... The actors, though, make it all worthwhile. In their hands, it’s a contemplative and always watchable take on the past."
The Old Man,1,"Much of the show’s success comes down to Bridges, who anchors a rickety character visibly battered by the past yet able to shapeshift in the present."
The Old Man,1,"The Old Man delivers predictable spy sub-plots, but its character study of aging agents caught up in moral quandaries proves fascinating."
The Old Man,1,"It’s Bridges’ show. When the story leaves him for too long, you itch for his return."
The Old Man,1,"Bridges lends grain and texture to a role that could too easily be a geriatric Ethan Hunt: Chase may be close to infallible, but he also gets meaningfully frustrated and weary."
The Old Man,1,There’s lots here to satisfy action fans that are above all craving an adrenaline jolt. The Old Man has some of the most gruesome and distinctly shot fight scenes since Taken.
The Old Man,1,"What makes this... more than just another boomer action-adventure epic is its interrogation of the selfish, destructive, and self-righteous Chase’s claim to heroism."
The Old Man,1,"The Old Man, like an old man, is best when it ambles with a contemplative pace."
The Old Man,1,It’s that intentional space The Old Man gives to that story that transforms the series into a must-watch event.
The Old Man,1,"“The Old Man” wants you to feel the pain of both an unclean conscience and a fight to the death. One way or another, everyone here gets dirty."
The Old Man,1,"It offers exactly what the poster promises, in two excellent performances from Bridges and Lithgow, and offers a bonus in some gripping close-quarters combat sequences. But the story itself feels like an afterthought."
The Old Man,1,"“The Old Man” will travel down many different roads, with surprises and revelations lurking around every corner. Be sure to enjoy the ride."
The Old Man,1,The filmmakers of “The Old Man” have crafted a dazzlingly intense dramatic thriller that ranks up there with the best TV of the year so far.
The Old Man,1,"There's an uneasy feeling throughout the first few episodes because the show never quite spells out if anyone involved here is a ""bad"" guy or a ""good"" guy. Rather, everyone lives in this murky in-between, and that makes for compelling character drama."
The Old Man,1,"The Old Man, based on Thomas Perry's 2017 novel, displays bursts of crackerjack energy as the season continues. Too often, though, the series brings its spy-thriller momentum to a jolting halt with incongruous monologues and hackneyed writing."
The Old Man,1,More compelling as an actors' showcase than as a thriller.
The Old Man,1,"The series is patient enough to let us understand its central character’s trauma, but it doesn’t make us to wallow in it."
The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on."
The Old Man,1,"More than just a showcase for Bridges, The Old Man is an unsparing, action-packed series about what happens when we live long enough to see the sins of the past thrown back in our faces."
The Old Man,1,"What makes The Old Man worth watching is not necessarily its flashback-heavy narrative, it’s the talent at its center. Bridges and Lithgow give powerful performances as two aging men whose relationship spans decades and defies explanation."
The Old Man,1,"If the simple pleasures of a dude and his dogs roaming America, picking off bad guys, sounds like your desired entertainment, The Old Man will provide it. Anything more, well, that’s yet to be seen."
The Old Man,1,"Just as the 72-year-old Bridges is not a conventional action hero, The Old Man seeks out interesting narrative ground that avoids any common constraints whenever possible."
Dark Winds,1,"The series is unfortunately timely, as well, airing on the streaming network after the Supreme Court continues to take away the sovereignty of Native lands. Mostly, however, it is a terrific, well-deserved showcase for longtime character actor McClarnon."
Dark Winds,1,"McClarnon delivers an intense, if not smoldering performance, that is wonderfully complemented by actors Kiowa Gordon and Jessica Matten. A beautifully done series. ‘Dark Winds’ is the best show on AMC since ‘The Walking Dead’”"
Dark Winds,1,"“Dark Winds” may seem similar to other detective shows but it’s more than that. With well-written and sharply defined characters, plus an invigorating and tightly wound story, it’ll be hard to wait a week for each episode to drop."
Dark Winds,1,Becomes easily absorbing and is already gripping. ... It's a must-watch.
Dark Winds,1,"Featuring Native-American talent in front of and behind the camera, it's a solid mystery that's better during its wide-open-spaces buildup than the somewhat messy finish."
Dark Winds,1,"As both a period piece and a cultural primer for an unabashedly Native American story told through a Native American lens, Dark Winds successfully gives audiences a different perspective and backdrop for a crime drama."
Dark Winds,1,"Dark Winds feels like it will deftly combine a standard murder mystery, tribal traditions and difficulties, and supernatural elements, tied together by a great performance by McClarnon."
Dark Winds,1,'Dark Winds' is a basic comfortable summer crime mystery you can watch with your grandparents that could easily be on network television.
Dark Winds,1,"Gripping, gorgeously shot and propelled by superb performances, Dark Winds is a very good show that also happens to be very important."
Dark Winds,1,Dark Winds is set in a time and place utterly foreign to American TV. You'll love it there.
Dark Winds,1,"Not always a gripping mystery, but a promising prelude for an ongoing series."
Dark Winds,1,“Dark Winds” has a sensibility that draws you in and compensates for the lapses in storytelling.
Dark Winds,1,"Because there is such an effort to bring authenticity to the production, the cultures and traditions of the Navajo play a central part not just in the milieu of the series but in the story itself."
Dark Winds,1,This is an atmospheric crime thriller with real potential.
Dark Winds,1,"With its welcome exploration of characters and cultures that are still under-represented, a brisk pace, and engrossing story, Dark Winds is that rare thing in contemporary TV -- a show I actually wanted to see more of."
Dark Winds,1,"McClarnon gives a powerfully measured performance, as if Leaphorn’s grief and anger can only be vented one teaspoon at a time."
Dark Winds,1,McClarnon is perfect in the role of a man forced to navigate the difficulties of simultaneously protecting his people while policing them. He moves deliberately throughout the beautifully shot series.
Dark Winds,1,"Dark Wind has an admirable directness of approach: It doesn’t slow down to explain itself to viewers, trusting that its milieu will come through loud and clear."
Dark Winds,1,"A gripping, pulpy drama with a tangible sense throughout that the people telling this story know what is distinct about it, elevating the more familiar thriller components into something that feels special."
Dark Winds,1,A heartfelt and accomplished thriller that doubles as a proof of concept for Camel Rock Studios’ ability to tell Native stories in popular television genres.
Dark Winds,1,"But, as with good mystery novels, it's the characters that make the series worthwhile. Gordon and McClarnon play nicely off each other as their sometimes contentious partnership deepens into friendship."
Dark Winds,1,"[Zach McClarnon] takes on the role of Leaphorn, and plays him so well -- with quiet dignity, a reluctant humor, and just enough menace to let you see what lies beneath the surface -- that you quickly get the feeling nobody else would have worked."
Dark Winds,1,"Dark Winds is never edge-of-your-seat stuff, the series instead cooking at a satisfying simmer."
Dark Winds,1,"Both a Western and a noir thriller that is at its most interesting when it delves into these deeper contradictions, it often loses focus on a fraught journey towards something more reflective."
Dark Winds,1,Dark Winds is at its best when focusing on aspects of Navajo culture that give “Dark Winds” a unique flavor and at its most TV-unreal when officers wander into dangerous situations without calling for backup.
Dark Winds,1,"Entertaining, but the book is better."
Dark Winds,1,"In the end, Dark Winds is a must-watch for its performances, direction, location, and style. But the show falters in answering its mysteries."
Dark Winds,1,Zahn McClarnon leads a solid cast In AMC's Dark Winds.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,An irresistible summer escape that's at its best when two generations of coming-of-age stories collide.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"The Summer I Turned Pretty is such great TV mainly because of its talented young cast. It's breezy fun, but completely delivers on the poignant moments as well."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"Despite some undercooked relationship drama, the series promises strong female characters and a beautiful setting to spend some time within."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,The Summer I Turned Pretty is a can’t miss summer watch. The changes from the books fill out this world and bring viewers deeper into it. The young cast is stellar and the music perfectly soundtracks the season.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,Teens will love this sun-dripped romantic show.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"As sweet, light, and refreshing as a soda on ice by the swimming pool, this book-based drama tackles the confusion and loveliness of an awkward coming of age."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"While the romance might be lacking, the abundance of strong female friendships is guaranteed to warm your heart."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"The Summer I Turned Pretty is typical fluff content but with toned-down teenage-y idiocy, and cinematic class. Take out that fedora, clean up well, apply some sunscreen and dive into the world of Belly and her babes… head first, please."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"The Summer I Turned Pretty is sweet summer escapism. No need to fight the current on this one; just lay back and let the soft waves of teenage nostalgia whisk you away to a simpler, much cringer time."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,The specificity of Laurel’s fantasy summer is ultimately what rescues The Summer I Turned Pretty from being too sticky sweet.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"The contrast between the adolescents and grown-ups' struggles, the protagonist's charisma and her deliciously pop-py playlist, make these series an enjoyable watch. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"While “The Summer I Turned Pretty” doesn’t exactly reinvent the breezy teen summer series, it’s a bit like an overly sweet icy pop. Not very nutritious, messy af, but fun while it lasts."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"The characters feel lived in, with warm chemistries and rich histories that suggest they are well known by their creator."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"Based on a novel by Jenny Han, it's well written and distinctly tender in places, with the extra dimension of also being a coming-of-new-age story for the mums. Nice."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series is striving to capture that feeling of first love, of growing up and finding your own path. There’s moody music, hazy photography, and characters in slow motion. And yet, none of it quite works."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,A solid coming-of-ager wrapped in a not-so-good romance.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"It is sunshine packed in a cinnamon roll for anyone who wants to watch something light and heartwarming with just the right hint of drama. The show knows what it’s aiming for and keeps within its walls, never claiming to be something that it’s not."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,"While it's not exactly a faithful, word-for-word adaptation of the book, this seven-part TV series is sure to delight Han's fans as they finally get to see her most popular love triangle play out on-screen."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series, which evokes YA soaps like The OC and Gossip Girl, is pleasant enough, if blandly formulaic: full of breathless kisses, swim suits, dances, and mood-supporting pop songs - plus boozing, hooking up, and cheating, bathed in fumbling innocence."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,A mediocre teen romance with memorable moments.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,1,An edgier take on teen love than To All the Boys I've Loved Before.
Better Call Saul,1,"The thrilling midseason finale brings two important characters to Jimmy’s doorstep, with their fates previewing where the series will go in its final episodes..."
Better Call Saul,1,It has remained faithful to that restrained rhythm... but the time has come to blow everything up. [Full review in Spanish]
Better Call Saul,1,Michael Mando truly rose to the occasion.
Better Call Saul,1,You do feel like there's a trajectory. You do feel like it's coming to an end... It is a powerful show and very well put together.
Better Call Saul,1,"While its choices may fall under new scrutiny once the seasons over, this episode is a staggering achievement, giving one character the showcase he deserves before the fate he cant outrun arrives."
Better Call Saul,1,"Now in its final season, Better Call Saul remains just as expansively cinematic and claustrophobically tense as ever it was, with creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould still masters of their desert domain."
Better Call Saul,1,"It’s clear the show runners are getting better and better at making great TV, while the actors slightly undermine the story by looking older now in the prequel than they did in the main series."
Better Call Saul,1,"Vince Gilligan, Bob Odenkirk and company are firing on all cylinders in the AMC show’s final season..."
Better Call Saul,1,"To make a final season the best of a series is a near-impossible task, but by keeping this story level, consistent, and wonderfully written, this cast of characters takes a fairly straightforward story and makes it as intricate as any of Jimmys cons."
Better Call Saul,1,Season six is yet another reminder that Better Call Saul has not only stepped out from under Breaking Bad‘s shadow but developed a confident identity as its own series chronicling the slow and steady demise of its protagonists.
Better Call Saul,1,"Everything that made its earlier seasons fantastic is here in season 6, only turned up to 11. The acting is still phenomenal, the writing is top-notch, the cinematography remains stunning yet understated, and the subtle touches and motifs are all there."
Better Call Saul,1,"It's still the most extraordinary, riveting drama on TV, substantially because of its emphasis on showing and implying before scripting what it's thinking."
Better Call Saul,1,"The devil is in the details, but so is everything else. It’s a pleasure to be three steps behind."
Better Call Saul,1,"Without wanting to sound grandiose, it is one of those shows that reminds you that you are observing not just entertainment, but an art form, as distinct and intricate as literature."
Better Call Saul,1,"Better Call Saul stays the course at the beginning of its final season, building anticipation towards a finale that we know is just the beginning of a new story instead of the ending of the current one."
Better Call Saul,1,"Amid the tension, rollicking dialogue and flashes of violence, Better Call Saul’s winning attribute continues to be its slow-burn consistency."
Better Call Saul,1,"As the show nears its end, series creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould have established its credentials not only as a worthy sequel, but a great series in its own right."
Better Call Saul,1,"One of Better Call Saul‘s most impressive qualities throughout its run has been its consistency, and that holds true in season six."
Better Call Saul,1,"So far, Better Call Saul Season 6 belongs to Kim Wexler. And watching her moral fall is just as painful for us as it is for Jimmy."
Better Call Saul,1,If only more movies could tell stories this gripping and ingenious about characters this complex!
Better Call Saul,1,"Better Call Saul remains a well-plotted masterpiece, similar to Breaking Bad”for which “Saul” is a prequel, complete with unexpected twists and action sequences that a viewer might expect to go right but end up going left."
Better Call Saul,1,"There are some terrifically enjoyable moments which not only showcase Saul’s craft as virtuoso manipulator and prevaricator, but Odenkirk’s own considerable talents."
Better Call Saul,1,Within three minutes we’re reminded why this is one of the most visually creative series in television history.
Better Call Saul,1,"Could ""Better Call Saul"" have been a love story all along?"
Better Call Saul,1,An all-time great comedic-drama that can now boast top-tier action and thriller scenes to its ever growing list of feats. There’s no better way to begin Better Call Saul’s closing chapter.
Better Call Saul,1,"There’s a lot to unpack here, in a lot of ways, but it’s probably best to start by getting to the point: The new season, through the first two episodes released to critics, is good."
Better Call Saul,1,"Six seasons in, Better Call Saul has grown into a climactic, character-driven drama whose greatness parallels that of Breaking Bad."
Better Call Saul,1,We should thank our lucky stars to have lived in a time when Better Call Saul was airing.
Better Call Saul,1,Inventing tantalizing new mysteries right as the end begins? Only the best artists pull a con like that.
Better Call Saul,1,"It’s safe to say that “Better Call Saul” has lost none of its wit or nuance, picking up with the same level of quality that earned it the #1 place on this site’s list of the best TV of 2020."
Better Call Saul,1,"Maybe the fact of its parts fitting together uneasily suggests it’s a harder task than its creators expected. Still and all, the show is urgently worth watching for Odenkirk and for Seehorn."
Better Call Saul,1,"It’s the privilege of watching a series as well written, well made, and well acted as Better Call Saul that is the real takeaway here, and the work that went into making it possible is likely to be the show’s legacy."
Better Call Saul,1,The descent of Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman continues to be one of television's best character studies.
Better Call Saul,1,The season premiere of Better Call Saul was worth the wait. It drops the viewer right back into the story without missing a beat and sets up a compelling last rite for Jimmy McGillSaul Goodman.
Better Call Saul,1,"It will be sad to let the brilliance of ""Better Call Saul"" go, but it's already abundantly clear that the series is going to stick the landing, and conclude in a manner that will firmly ensconce ""Better Call Saul"" in the pantheon of all-time-great TV."
Chloe,1,"[Doherty gives] a stunning performance -- a rare skill to make this potentially one-note villain, something far deeper, nuanced and potentially sympathetic."
Chloe,1,"Chloe struggles to transcend its rather uninspired central theme: that there is a gulf between one’s real and online life. Nearly 20 years on from the emergence of social media, it is a message slightly too self-evident to build a whole drama around."
Chloe,1,"Chloe is an intriguing tangle of lies and obsession, a well-made striptease of a show that slowly reveals all over six episodes of cringey psychological suspense."
Chloe,1,"Instead of diving into the trite subject of sociopathic behavior, like Inventing Anna or Dirty John, Chloe finds depth, authenticity, and even compassion in its profile of a scammer."
Chloe,1,"Chloe is a series of misdirections, shattered genre expectations, and an unraveling mystery that heads into the deep dark of interpersonal relationships."
Chloe,1,"What’s so different about a drama that pokes around in the fake lives that are presented on Instagram? Well, the tone bristles with the kind of grim, acid humour that Killing Eve had in its early seasons."
Chloe,1,"Because of key performances from Doherty, Hall and Bennett-Warner, Chloe goes from a predictable stalking tale to an entertaining thriller that may take some unexpected turns."
Chloe,1,"Against a wave of similar shows that luxuriate in the lies, each incremental step away from the truth in “Chloe” carries a real, sobering weight with it."
Chloe,1,So disturbing it will scare you off social media...
Chloe,1,"Chloe is a smart, subtle thriller about friendship and identity in the social media age. Actress Erin Doherty is stellar as Becky, a multifaceted character who is petty and selfish, as well as dogged and loyal."
Chloe,1,"With a sharply-written script, nuanced direction, and deft acting, particularly on the part of Doherty, Chloe is a study in modern social dynamics and their psychological impacts as much as it is a ravishing mystery."
Chloe,1,"Becky is deeply unlikeable, she’s a puzzle; what outrages will she put in play to soothe her aching psyche. Oh, and did I mention she leaves her mother [with advanced dementia] alone and in danger while she’s out gallivanting and scheming?... Sweet girl."
Chloe,1,"'Ingrid Goes West' meets 'The Girl on the Train,' with entertaining results."
Chloe,1,"Remarkably good, Erin Doherty captures the full range of emotions experienced by her character."
Chloe,1,"[Erin Doherty] is simultaneously creepy and sympathetic, and endlessly entertaining as she conducts her cons with great flair."
Chloe,1,The premise may not be totally original and the plot occasionally daft but Chloe feels crisp and new and Doherty is like a breath of fresh air.
Chloe,1,"While it often strained credibility, this was intriguing stuff with a star-making turn from Doherty."
Chloe,1,"The writer is Alice Seabright, and if I were her I’d be thanking God for Erin Doherty. ""Thank you, God, for Erin Doherty,’ I’d be saying, morning, noon and night."""
Chloe,1,"If you haven’t seen it yet, let me just say that I think this may be the first time social media and its attendant ills have been fully and convincingly incorporated into a TV drama, and that Doherty is indeed the real thing."
Chloe,0,"Perhaps the idea was to evoke the haunting effects of memory and loss which can never be completely resolved, but it felt like a deflating end to a drama which promised much more."
Chloe,0,"It’s not that Chloe is awful... It’s just a bit implausible, and far too slick for its own good."
Chloe,1,I enjoyed this show mainly for Erin Doherty’s freakish ability to swoon between the two characters.
Chloe,1,"This is a fresh, invigorating spin on the psychological thriller, full of surprises and with an outstanding lead performance by Doherty."
Chloe,1,"...packed with intriguing flavours, with Erin captivating with her disturbing yet somehow sympathetic portrayal of Becky..."
Chloe,1,"Intriguing, repulsive and thrilling in equal measure, and something you really do need to see."
Chloe,1,"[Chloe] is as emotionally astute as it is compulsive. However its twists and turns ultimately resolve themselves, watching Doherty navigate them will be a treat."
Chloe,1,Writer and director Alice Seabright's six-part psychological thriller takes a perceptive look at the illusory nature of life in the social media age.
Chloe,1,"Ultimately, it’s a commentary on social media, because isn’t Becky’s behaviour just an extreme version of the fakery deployed by every Instagram user curating glossy pictures of their oh-so-successful life?"
Chloe,1,"It is a fierce, fresh sort-of-murder-mystery that is as keenly scripted as it is paced, and whose many threads are held firmly together by an outstanding performance from Erin Doherty."
Chloe,1,Erin Doherty's lead performance - implying depth while maintaining a calculating remove and blank ambiguity - makes an otherwise adequate but unremarkable psychological thriller worth watching.
Chloe,1,"A compelling mystery, blending false identity, secrets among friends, and the curated picture of perfection we post online."
Breaking Bad,1,What more can you say about Breaking Bad at this point? It delivered the most anti-anti hero of a Golden Age of TV riddled with such characters.
Breaking Bad,1,"We all knew what was coming: it was just a matter of how we got there. In that, Breaking Bad nailed it, delivering a memorable final season and final episode that showed that people CAN change, even if it's too late."
Breaking Bad,1,The most finely crafted drama on television nailed the most spine-tingling series finale in modern TV.
Breaking Bad,1,This final batch of Breaking Bad is one of the best run of episodes TV has ever offered.
Breaking Bad,1,"A brilliant, maddening, shocking, all-consuming piece of storytelling that will never be forgotten by all those who saw it."
Breaking Bad,1,"With Season 5, few can argue that Breaking Bad is exiting at a creative peak, thanks to the triple nerve-frying episodes ""Rabid Dog"", ""To'hajiilee"", and ""Ozymandias."""
Breaking Bad,1,A final run of episodes that both matched and sometimes outdid what had come before artistically.
Breaking Bad,1,"With only fifteen episodes to go before the saga closes, we'll all have answers sooner than we hope. But for now, the journey is as intoxicating as it's ever been."
Breaking Bad,0,"The second half of season five had some great individual episodes, but felt slightly schematic. And the show's finale was maybe the most conventional of the entire series."
Breaking Bad,1,"For better or worse, this is where Breaking Bad's stunning, five-season story draws to a close."
Breaking Bad,1,"This wasn't a jaw-dropping finale, but that's largely because it was a jaw-dropped television show. Gilligan didn't save any rounds for the concluding episode. He emptied them as he went along."
Breaking Bad,0,"I can't shake the sense that ""Felina"" as a finale, and Breaking Bad as a whole, would have been more satisfying if it had been less satisfying."
Breaking Bad,1,"I wouldn't have had the finale go this way, but I wasn't ever watching Breaking Bad to have it go the way I wanted... It's art. It's complicated. I didn't really like it, but I still loved it."
Breaking Bad,1,"It's powerful television. It's a stunning ending. But is it a fitting conclusion to Breaking Bad?... To be sure, that's not the ending to the show I thought I was watching."
Breaking Bad,1,"This was certainly a fitting end to Breaking Bad. Taut, aggressive, mesmerizing. A bit loose in the plotting and logistics, but true and fair to its characters to the bitter end."
Breaking Bad,1,"A terrific, tense [premiere] directed by Cranston and written by Peter Gould that holds up to some astronomically high expectations."
Breaking Bad,0,"For five seasons Breaking Bad cooked up some the best drama on television, hands down, but unfortunately, for its final hurrah, we got an unsatisfying batch."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad managed to be the sum of its parts, foregrounding compelling details involving the twisted nature of Walt's universe that made its reasonably tidy conclusion beside the point."
Breaking Bad,1,"Delivered everything that has been great about Breaking Bad. It had tension, pathos, brutality, emotion, humor, jaw-dropping shocks -- but also resolution."
Breaking Bad,1,"Enormously satisfying television, with thickly cinematic tension and psychological gamesmanship culminating in a shower of bullets and bloodshed."
Breaking Bad,1,"A void has been left in television, but my only hope is... that Breaking Bad inspires networks and writers to take risks and to aim as high as Walter White. Don't settle for 60 percent purity when audiences have tasted 97."
Breaking Bad,1,"Ultimately, Breaking Bad was a show about the pursuit of happiness -- and the unhappiness it can cause."
Breaking Bad,1,"Well Breaking Bad, that was damned perfect. Not that we should have expected any less."
Breaking Bad,1,A deeply satisfying and surprisingly emotional finale.
Breaking Bad,1,"For strength and purity of vision, for its unique calibration of its core character, Gilligan's magnum opus is unsurpassed."
Breaking Bad,1,"Fear not, they've pulled it off marvellously."
Breaking Bad,1,It was far and away the most tense I've ever been while watching a TV show.
Breaking Bad,1,"Now that Breaking Bad is coming to its harrowing, heart-stopping end, we can see it, steadily and whole, as a morally complex masterwork, maybe the best thing that's ever hit our TV screens."
Breaking Bad,1,"Not only did Vince Gilligan's five-season, hyper-violent prose poem to midlife male frustration tie up virtually every loose end in sight, it contained the Holy Grail of all storytelling: an Actual Moment of Truth."
Breaking Bad,1,"I didn't mind the lack of jaw-dropping surprises, because that slow unraveling made such perfect emotional sense."
Breaking Bad,1,"It has been almost perfectly executed -- precise in plot and vivid in character, with taut dialogue, mordant wit, and photography that's eerie and ordinary and beautiful in places."
Breaking Bad,1,"I line up diligently each Sunday, like a junkie twitching for her next fix, and I and my fellow addicts bask in 44 minutes of simply amazing television."
Breaking Bad,1,"This is a brilliant, incisive portrait of a familiar kind of stunted masculinity, albeit one made gothic and grotesque and frequently blackly comic."
Breaking Bad,1,"Fans were promised resolution for every character in the final eight episodes of Vince Gilligan's epic tale -- and that's exactly what they got. But along the way it proved to be a murderous, manic and mesmerizing ride."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad is a series that eschews didacticism but remembers, as so many of the finest films of the 1970s did, that moral arguments are the most exciting ones audiences can have."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad has been utterly electrifying television, weird, funny, emotionally rich and endlessly surprising. but in the end, the finale of this great American series turned out to be one of its lesser episodes."
Breaking Bad,1,Its creator Vince Gilligan's extraordinary storytelling that brings us to a dramatic zenith that is now completely character driven.
Breaking Bad,1,"Is the show a critique of the devastating potential of frontier masculinity or is it itself a masculine fantasy?... At this point, it seems that it wants to be both."
Breaking Bad,1,"It seemed like Vince Gilligan had set himself an impossible task delivering a satisfactory ending to this incredible series. But satisfy, it did."
Breaking Bad,1,"By season five, despite Breaking Bad's addictive qualities, the comedy's thinning out, and the ending of one particular episode is so shocking and distressing that it was weeks before I could bring myself to watch the next one."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad's genius is in bringing us to the realisation that at its best, dramedy is a serious contemporary art form, and no laughing matter."
Breaking Bad,1,Dostoevsky in the desert -- an epic tragedy.
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad is a parable about entrepreneurship, the very basis of American capitalism. Entrepreneur eventually becomes corporation, which is what the entrepreneur wants, and with that, loses all humanity."
Breaking Bad,1,"Hell is where this show has landed: into the ""darkness visible"" that Milton describes in Paradise Lost, reigned over by the best, most credible, Lucifer ever to have appeared in pop culture."
Breaking Bad,1,The genius of Breaking Bad is that it retained every single aspect that made it great while constantly innovating and subverting its own mythology.
Breaking Bad,1,"I realised just how long I had been gritting my jaw and holding my head in my hands whilst watching for the past month, and to have it all just calmly end was the perfect release."
Breaking Bad,1,The second and third to last episodes of the series might be the two best in Breaking Bad history.
Breaking Bad,1,This is the end that Breaking Bad deserved. [Full Review in Spanish]
Breaking Bad,1,We aren't so much suckers in our sympathy for Walt as paralyzed friends who can't quite believe a man we cared for could change so quickly or so thoroughly.
Breaking Bad,1,"It feels like classic Breaking Bad and there's a lot to explore going forward. All in all, we still hail to the king."
Breaking Bad,1,Gilligan and company have crafted one of TV's most compelling storylines in years.
Breaking Bad,1,"The show is an exercise in ethics and impossible choice, rooted in the heightened reality of our country's wracked and wretched West."
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad has always been full of whiplash twists and jaw-dropping cliffhangers, and this season doesn't ease back."
Breaking Bad,1,"There's something about this show that just transcends, and keeps on transcending, popular entertainment. It just keeps getting better and better, going higher and higher, until mere words, mere platitudes, can no longer do it justice."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad delivers a final season that is as gripping and rewarding as we've come to expect. It's the show that knocks.
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad is essential viewing: a Molotov cocktail of poverty, science and decline."
Breaking Bad,1,"We get the neatness and the uncertainty, which shows a Heisenberg level of mastery."
Breaking Bad,1,"Take a bow, Vince Gilligan."
Breaking Bad,1,"Because Breaking Bad is great art, the drama invites many different interpretations."
Breaking Bad,1,"If this last hour or so was a little too perfect for its own good, then that's because it left (almost) no loose end untied"
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad did what any show would hope to do: bring its narrative to a natural, organic conclusion while also leaving us wishing the story could just go on and on."
Breaking Bad,1,"One way or another, you've got to figure Walt is going down. And, thanks to Cranston, he's going down in TV history as one of the medium's most fascinating, memorable and grandly tragic characters."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad is more than science. It's intelligent design.
Breaking Bad,1,"I could not be happier to see Breaking Bad return at the top of its game, tackling the beginning of the end with the same inventive, emotional spirit that defined the show during its greatest, most legendary periods."
Breaking Bad,1,"We can only hope the remaining seven episodes live up to everything ""Blood Money"" delivered."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad is inarguably one of the greatest serial dramas of all-time.
Breaking Bad,1,"If there is a single unsatisfying element in Breaking Bad's continuing brilliance, it's the absence of any intimate sense of Walt, any feeling for what goes on in his head or heart."
Breaking Bad,1,"[Vince] Gilligan said that a crucial part of his job was to keep people watching. That's the tricky challenge of the best serial television, and it's one that Breaking Bad has fulfilled, up to this moment, with unusual daring."
Breaking Bad,1,"The episode is riveting, as is the quiet power of Dean Norris's performance as Hank."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad is the quintessential series of our binge-watching TV era.
Breaking Bad,1,Everything's in place in this one episode. We just have to bite our fingernails down to nothing while we ride it out.
Breaking Bad,1,"No matter what happens, the end of Bad should be very good."
Breaking Bad,1,"It is a tremendous series, terrifically written and acted, with a black sense of humor unmatched by any other."
Breaking Bad,1,"The episode is as marvelous, deranged and unsettling as anything series creator/executive producer Vince Gilligan and his team have done."
Breaking Bad,1,"Directed by Bryan Cranston and written by Peter Gould, the episode, titled ""Blood Money,"" is lean and highly stylized, wasting no time picking up where the jolting mid-season cliffhanger, ""Gliding Over All,"" left off."
Breaking Bad,1,"Such awfulness begs for punishment, and Breaking Bad has never carried itself as a show that would deny the audience such a thing."
Breaking Bad,1,"What I will say about the first new episode-besides that it jams the accelerator on the plot as it steers toward the brick wall of its end date-is that it continues that investigation, with a new twist suggested by last year's midseason finale."
Breaking Bad,1,Creative confidence has long been a hallmark of Breaking Bad but the program has rarely seemed more sure of where it's going than it does right now.
Breaking Bad,1,[Breaking Bad] certainly the most ambitious in chronicling the path of a good person falling from grace when presented with the right circumstances.
Breaking Bad,1,It's going to be just as mesmerizingly terrifying to plummet down from the heights of power with Walt as it was last season to sink into the depths of powerlessness.
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad is still a perfect model of filmed suspense.
Breaking Bad,1,"Simply put, there's no more unpredictable series, and its delicate handling of combustible ingredients will be admired and studied by writers for years to come."
Breaking Bad,1,"It's not a matter of wondering if Breaking Bad will be great, but where in the pantheon it will ultimately reside."
Breaking Bad,1,"Taut, efficient and directed with a scalpel, Breaking Bad remains a marvel."
Breaking Bad,1,Consistently great.
Breaking Bad,1,"Taut, chilling and measuredly paced for maximum impact. Gilligan and company keep on pushing Breaking Bad to new highs."
Breaking Bad,1,Mind-blowingly magnificent.
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad is one of the great shows of television's Golden Age, and the first two episodes of the show's fifth season will give viewers no reason to think otherwise."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad never makes viewers feel like they are watching scripted TV characters; the characters always feel real.
Breaking Bad,1,"There are so many reasons the show stands out from virtually any other series on TV: the performances, the writing, the direction and, most of all, the creative vision of Vince Gilligan."
Breaking Bad,1,Breaking Bad continues to demonstrate that it both is and is not different from the serious dramas to which it is often compared.
Breaking Bad,1,"Bad is too complex a series and too brilliantly distinctive a creation to be reduced to a simple ""Crime does not pay"" motto."
Breaking Bad,1,The creeping sense of dread has been part of what has made Breaking Bad so engrossing.
Breaking Bad,1,"It has plenty to say about the things humans are capable of and, like most great series, it rewards the careful viewer."
Breaking Bad,1,It might be 16 of the best upcoming hours on television.
Breaking Bad,1,We can't take our eyes away from the brilliant Cranston.
Breaking Bad,1,"Breaking Bad continues at the same disciplined, regimented pace, fussing over small details and picking at new threads, even with the end looming."
Breaking Bad,1,"The season five pre miere ""Live Free or Die"", more than maintains the series' record of excellence."
Outer Range,1,"A puzzle box of a program — and the weirder that Outer Range gets, and moodier as well, the more it intrigues and engrosses."
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range proves to be unique, alluring, and infinitely odd. I applaud its approach to the unknown with a distinctive, massive anomaly that still takes a personal approach. Expertly acted, and wonderfully strange, it's a hit."
Outer Range,1,"Themes of faith and redemption, penance and choice are strong but often become confused through the staccato pacing and unpredictable character actions. That intrigue will keep you going, however."
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range is enjoyable not just because it’s mysterious, well-written, and beautifully shot with stunning sound design. It’s enjoyable because it gives you permission to suffer the pain of insignificance."
Outer Range,1,"“Outer Range” is a bit touch-and-go in terms of its interest factor but, then again, you’ll want to know how it all turns out, thanks to the sci-fi twist that saves it from mediocrity."
Outer Range,1,"Everything's heavy and dark and serious, and it can be exhausting... The fantastical properties of this situation interests me... but they only give you a little bit per episode."
Outer Range,1,Outer Range should be one of the most discussed series in the coming weeks. [Full review in Spanish]
Outer Range,1,"Though visually stunning and populated by excellent actors, Outer Range can't figure out whether it's a Western or a sci-fi thriller."
Outer Range,0,"Brolin’s good and if the series eschewed the sci-fi conceit there’s enough good actors here to at least make it entertaining. But slathering a sci-fi element on top of it and not understanding what tone to strike doesn’t lead to oil, it leads to crap."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has expansive scenery (when it can be seen), and decent performances from Brolin, Taylor, and Poots. But neither its family drama and supernatural elements are compelling enough to make up for the show’s slow pace."
Outer Range,1,You must persevere and embrace the madness else this will become a difficult watch to endure. Two very distinct genres and two very different storylines are squeezed together to make a highly original if polarising series.
Outer Range,1,"In less capable hands this could have easily made for a frustrating, impatient experience, but there’s something hauntingly hypnotic about Outer Range that demands you stay with it, even when its hold over you slackens."
Outer Range,1,"The show isn't at prestige TV level, its pacing and tone blowing in the wind. But the sci-fi Western is unique, at times intense and unnerving and driven by the force that is Josh Brolin."
Outer Range,1,I really want to find out what's going on in that hole.
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range is one of the boldest, weirdest, and most affecting sci-fi shows of the 21st century. Despite the inevitable comparison to Stranger Things, the series forges its own path and succeeds because its so aggressively grounded in reality."
Outer Range,1,"As odd as this show is, it is beautiful to watch and engrossing as hell. You may not fully know what is going on as you watch this show, but it is worth sticking around to find out."
Outer Range,1,"Neither bodies nor secrets stay buried forever and on Outer Range theyve got nothing but timeholes, and rocks, and seeping pits of it-but we only get 8 hours of this mystical Western and its worth every minute."
Outer Range,1,"There’s a touch of Lost about proceedings, a hint of Westworld, a soupçon of Interstellar, but all grounded by the travails of domestic life amongst the vast open plains."
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range hovers around a dark hole, dark souls and plants this question in your head: is all-knowing, special?"
Outer Range,1,For a show to embrace the strange elements of the cosmos and intertwine them with everyday life as well as Outer Range does is worth praising for that alone.
Outer Range,1,"It’s hard to say, but based on the quality of writing, acting, and directing, I’m inclined to believe that Outer Range is a compelling and dark mystery box and more likely than not worth the time investment."
Outer Range,1,This show is the best use of Josh Brolin I think Ive ever seen.
Outer Range,1,"We’re getting something that’s unlike anything we’ve had on TV recently. And while it may not be everyone’s cup of clamato, it’s worth the ride to see where it’s going."
Outer Range,1,"Flashes of dark humor and just plain surrealness keep the show from stalling, but it's a slow burn with many burning questions."
Outer Range,1,"Though its slow to carve out the particulars of its world, iOuter Rangei is ultimately an alluring exploration of lives and lands lost."
Outer Range,0,Measuring most shows against the masterful Twin Peaks feels unfair. But Brian Watkins’ Outer Range baldly baits the comparison—sometimes with success but more often to his show’s detriment.
Outer Range,1,"Always weird, sometimes annoying, but frequently fascinating, Outer Range has Yellowstone's same sense of a cowboy family unaware that it has lived out its time."
Outer Range,1,"[The tone] can feel quite disjointed. But given that Outer Range is very much of the uncanny school of sci-fi, re-fashioning classic Western tropes to enigmatic ends, perhaps some off-putting qualities are appropriate."
Outer Range,1,"Despite intriguing performances from Josh Brolin, Imogen Poots, Lili Taylor, and Tamara Podemski, the overall story arc ends up frustratingly soapy, bloated, and ponderous."
Outer Range,1,"Its ambitions are subtle but powerful, and I cant wait to see how deep the rabbit hole goes in future seasons."
Outer Range,1,"Refreshingly, as somber as ‘Outer Range’ can be at times, it also has a great sense of humor and can be surprisingly funny and absurdist at times (Noah Reid is tremendous in this regard)."
Outer Range,1,What’s so great about Outer Range is that it’s something fresh while having the feel of a western in all the right ways.
Outer Range,1,"I sure hope there’s a second season because it’s a long and sometimes frustrating climb before we get to a handful of fantastically surprising twists, but a whole lot of other questions remain."
Outer Range,1,Brolin is a commanding presence and he has a natural gravitas that helps ground Outer Range’s more fantastical components.
Outer Range,1,"The cast, the premise, the score, the mysteryit all comes together to create something viewers may likely find very special"
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range offers a completely new take on the family story and the western, blending philosophy, religion, the sacred and profane, psychological horror, ancient and new tribalism, with an occasional nod to the Greek god Kronos."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has one of the worst momentum problems I've ever seen in a streaming show, squandering an evocative setting and some fun twists on portentous take-forever storytelling that prioritizes hints over character depth."
Outer Range,0,"By the end of eight frustrating and haphazardly paced episodes, exhaustion sets in."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range is a lumbering, self-serious hodgepodge of sci-fi and modern Western."
Outer Range,1,"Its a messy story well told, and is primed to polarize audiences with its time-twisting narrative as it tells a powerful story about trauma, faith, and family."
Outer Range,1,"At its best, then, the series only uses the void to imbue its more grounded themes -- grief, loneliness, faith, longing -- with a palpable eeriness"
Outer Range,1,"Outer Range has so many narrative trails to follow it seldom slows down, and sometimes the map gets a little scrambled. But the veterans among the cast are first-rate -- Mr. Brolin, Mr. Patton and Lili Taylor"
Outer Range,0,"While the family story and conflicts with the neighboring Tillersons feels overly familiar, credit series creator/writer Brian Watkins with building to shocks at the end of the first two episodes that leave viewers eager to learn what will happen next."
Outer Range,1,Outer Range is the rare kind of genre-bending work that leaves one wounded in its fresh take on our human existence while offering untold possibilities.
Outer Range,0,Brolin buffaloed by baffling black hole.
Outer Range,1,"Quirky, strange, dark — and engaging."
Outer Range,1,"No one will accuse Outer Range of being like anything else on television, despite the fact that you will spend most of your viewing time acknowledging its clear influences: Twin Peaks, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stranger Things, Yellowstone, Rectify, etc."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
Outer Range,1,This well-written quirky series from showrunner Brian Watkins will have you hooked from the start.
Outer Range,1,"The more Outer Range leans into its lunacy, the better it gets."
Outer Range,0,A lot of people do good work on “Open Range.” If only it provided a little more to hold onto.
Outer Range,1,"An economy of dialogue and a protraction of plot serve Outer Range well, as the mystery of the big spooky hole in the Abbotts’ west pasture isn’t the point of the series so much as its psychological fulcrum."
Night Sky,0,"The Night Sky is an undeniable misfire, but inside the slow first season is a gem of a story. I want to take the whole thing into Final Cut and chop it down to a short film."
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky’s rich, far-reaching imagination soars into sci-fi and mysticism without sacrificing the characters’ authenticity – Spacek and Simmons are phenomenal."
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky has the lugubrious pace of a show built for binging while multitasking. The upside of Night Sky's 8-episode length, though, is that it showcases two incredible performances by world-class actors Spacek and Simmons."
Night Sky,0,Watch the first episode of Night Sky and you’ll have found your new favourite show. Carry on for another seven and you’ll wish you stopped a lot earlier.
Night Sky,1,"An alien mystery made very much human, Night Sky unfolds a uniquely charming sci-fi with outstanding, sympathetic protagonists."
Night Sky,1,"Even when the show seems to be spinning its wheels, Simmons and Spacek find lovely grace notes in their performances."
Night Sky,1,"Every time that “Night Sky” threatens to drift off into something disposable, Simmons and Spacek shine, reminding everyone that they’re true stars."
Night Sky,1,Spacek and Simmons both... prove why they deserve awards for their acting skills.
Night Sky,0,"Despite strong performances by Simmons and Spacek, this series just plods along with only mildly entertaining bits of story."
Night Sky,1,"Were it not for Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons as said couple, it’s doubtful I’d still be sticking with it at the halfway point of its eight episodes. Everything that’s good about this first season so far is entirely down to them."
Night Sky,1,Night Sky doles out heartstring-tugging moments interspersed between intriguing character beats while curating a poignant story of humanity and finding meaning in the sadness.
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky has two worlds, and one of them is orbited by J.K. Simmons and Sissy Spacek. If you do choose to time-travel, you know which portal to hop on."
Night Sky,0,"It gets off to a touching start only to wind up tangled in its own narrative weeds, straying into multiple storylines that takes us away from what was working so well — the relationship between the two leads."
Night Sky,1,"Approaches with delicacy, thus facilitating the viewer's emotional connection... whoever is looking for an overdose of adrenaline, better put on another series. [Full review in Spanish]"
Night Sky,0,"Simmons and Spacek give great performances but it’s unfortunately not enough to keep Night Sky from being a dull, boring, and forgettable show."
Night Sky,1,A fun and assured riff on Spielbergian first-contact adventures.
Night Sky,1,Has a sweetness to it that we don’t get from most sci-fi.
Night Sky,1,"Effective sci-fi mystery or not, as a sharp-edged family drama, Night Sky is a compelling watch."
Night Sky,1,"The show is warm, sweet, and occasionally heartbreaking — but, unfortunately, much of that gets overshadowed as the story gets increasingly complicated."
Night Sky,0,"A low-heat, flat-toned, limited effects science fiction Big Secret movie whose “streaming series” stretchmarks show in every damned episode."
Night Sky,1,A slow unfolding mix of sci-fi conspiracy storylines balanced with often poignant meditations on mortality.
Night Sky,1,"Thanks to Spacek and Simmons, the show proves initially worthwhile despite being its meandering pace. For now, that tandem makes it worth watching the ""Sky."""
Night Sky,0,"Flat material that wants to mix the surreal nature of sci-fi with the humble humdrum of eating at a breakfast diner, but hardly feels more urgent or clever than that."
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky is a new angle to the stories of the never-ending cycles of life, the search for its meaning and something greater."
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky surrounds its leads with a mysterious SciFi premise, but the core relationship is the best aspect. It occasionally loses track but always finds its way back."
Night Sky,1,"For a sciencefiction series, Night Sky spends a lot of time dealing -- delightfully -- with issues grounded in terrestrial humanity; it’s mostly a gently paced love story."
Night Sky,1,"It’s hard not to sigh when you settle in for a new show and realize you’re in for something that the favorable critics will call “deliberate.” And yet, Night Sky is one that works."
Night Sky,0,"Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons are powerhouses here, delivering poignant performances, and even carrying the weight when the show spirals into numbing nonsense."
Night Sky,1,It’s just a shame that Night Sky squanders a great premise and some nifty world-building on the absurd or downright predictable instead.
Night Sky,1,"The two Oscar winners are never less than compelling, even if the same cannot be said of the mystery they’re involved in."
Night Sky,1,"Ultimately, this series addresses the restorative power of taking a leap of faith, and the enduring mystery of the unknown, and honors the capacity of two exceptional actors... to hold the story together with their emotional gravitational pull."
Night Sky,1,Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons twinkle in Amazon's new science fiction/mystery series about a pair of oldsters who travel to other galaxies in their backyard.
Night Sky,1,"I had hoped for more from that part of the tale, but many of you may feel more engaged. Coming so close on the heels of Outer Range, it is hard not to feel that Night Sky could have done so much more."
Night Sky,1,"You can’t go wrong with a project headlined by Oscar winners Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons — and they deliver the goods in “Night Sky""..."
Night Sky,1,“Night Sky” has a tendency to meander... but we remain involved mainly because of the opportunity to enjoy Spacek and Simmons at the top of their respective games.
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky is meticulously plotted, with each character and detail woven together intricately."
Night Sky,1,"Night Sky has a lot to offer for...science fiction, but it also has a lot to offer for fans of drama. A mysterious drama that uses science fiction concepts to explore relationships and the impact we leave on other people, this series is one to watch."
Night Sky,1,"Quietly assured performances by Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons generate a considerable amount of goodwill. ... On their own, they justify the expenditure of time to soak in their reflected glory for a few hours."
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
Night Sky,0,"The show trips over its length -- Night Sky is built around a decent idea for a 100-minute movie, which it then stretches to eight hours."
Night Sky,1,A chilling science fiction series that takes audiences on a captivating ride as they try to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Slow at times but the stunning visuals and incredible cast more than make up for it.
Night Sky,1,"Despite its sci-fi premise, the show’s storylines remain grounded in human experience."
Night Sky,1,Sissy Spacek And J.K. Simmons Shine In Stunning New Sci-Fi Series.
The Orville,1,The Orville: New Horizons marks a reset for the inconsistent first two seasons of this show and deserves to be on your watchlist more than ever.
The Orville,1,A level-up in terms of craft and story as Seth MacFarlane’s space series settles into its new home at Hulu.
The Orville,1,"This is a new, third season of a show that’s steadily found a following over its somewhat wayward journey, and to have these characters return with some seasoning in their lives is a welcome gift for fans who always stuck with The Orville."
The Orville,1,"While still pulling from the storytelling conventions of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and all the positives and negatives that comes with it, this season's premiere showcases that The Orville has taken a bold step forward in confidence and maturity."
The Orville,1,The Orville captures this attitude masterfully. It doesn’t shy away from the hurt or pain that the crew members are feeling. Each character deals with their traumatic experience in their own way
The Chosen,1,It's not merely higher-quality filming techniques or the relatability of actor Jonathan Roumie's portrayal of Jesus that accounts for The Chosen's power. It comes from its convincing portrayal of each disciple's transformation of desire.
The Chosen,1,"The Chosen represents the next phase of Christian television, that future might include crisp production and nuanced storytelling. But it also seems familiarly destined to remain lodged within one of popular media's oldest echo chambers."
The Chosen,1,"The first season of The Chosen offered one of the strongest filmed representations of the New Testament I'd ever seen. If anything, the first three episodes of Season Two surpass it."
The Last Kingdom,0,"Political intrigue and historical authenticity, not to mention decent acting, gave way to romantic slush, [and] unconvincing dialogue which could never make up its mind whether it wanted to be cod-Shakespearean or yoof-friendly."
The Last Kingdom,1,"It’s the dramatic oppositions which fuel The Last Kingdom's formidable grip – risk versus reward, or the heady allure of power balanced against what has to be sacrificed to attain it."
The Last Kingdom,1,The culmination of this epic journey will provide long-time fans more than enough to be satisfied with. Uhtred is a top-tier character.
Fleabag,1,"Season 2 is above the sex and the drama, it's above season 1 for that matter. This time it's about the comedy, the performances, the satire and one of the most intelligent uses of the fourth wall we've seen in recent years. Full review in Spanish"
Fleabag,1,"This season is messier, more complicated, and, yes, somehow, even better than the first."
Fleabag,1,Few writers could pull off turning such a deeply upsetting turn of events into a ridiculous dark comedy; the return of Fleabag marks Phoebe Waller-Bridge out as one of the most talented faces in British comedy.
Fleabag,1,"It's a perfect culmination to the character's journey, and a powerful comment on the way likability is currently framed as both the most essential and the least attainable trait a woman can have."
Fleabag,1,"That's the hat trick of Fleabag - it makes the audience champion a character they might not agree with, stand with, or completely understand."
Fleabag,1,"[Fleabag] deems the eternal debate about ""good feminism"" vs ""bad feminism"" as just another self-defeating litmus test against which women gauge their imperfections - which inevitably instills fears of falling short of the ""ideal feminist's"" expectations."
Fleabag,1,"In a sea of television content, was never a big fish, but in two short seasons, the tragi-com proved to be one of the medium's absolute best."
Fleabag,1,"In a television landscape drowning with new shows, Fleabag holds its own and stands proudly as a shining example that you can still surprise people."
Fleabag,1,"All the show's vulgar charm - and there is plenty of that, and at its best you're fully conspiring with it - somehow runs down before its time."
Fleabag,1,"We will always have this hilarious, tempestuous, raw work of genius at our fingertips. It's been a pleasure."
Fleabag,1,"The premiere is an early frontrunner for best episode of the season, if not the series, returning to Fleabag's theatrical roots for an evening of farce and concentrated viciousness"
Fleabag,1,"The show's humor remains raunchy, and the season's secular patron saint is a tough older woman who credits her comfort in her own skin to the bodily liberation of menopause."
Fleabag,1,"In just a handful of episodes (this only runs six), ""Fleabag"" blankets a world of emotions."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag distills the rawest human emotions down into the most economically precise dialogue, cutting directly to the quick, and all of it wrapped up in brightly glib packages. It's universal and also incredibly female."
Fleabag,1,"The comedy, which unfolds in six delightfully perfect installments, remains as sharp and as witty as ever."
Fleabag,1,The resulting second season is a meticulous triumph as gorgeous as it is wrenching.
Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge understands how to make Fleabag's defiance both galvanising and brittle. The emotional complexities of her trauma can be deliriously funny, while moments of self-destruction are sadly telling."
Fleabag,1,"This is well-trodden ground for observational comedies, but here the observations are precision-cut, unrelentingly dark and wildly funny."
Fleabag,1,Season 2 delivers a genius vision of unruly womanhood...
Fleabag,1,"If anything, the second and final season of the show may be even better than the first, especially in the way Waller-Bridge chose to turn her moments of direct address to the camera into a meta commentary on the very nature of the main character..."
Fleabag,1,Writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge's cleverness reaches new heights in the second and final season of her glorious bad-woman comedy.
Fleabag,1,"I was left speechless by the show's willingness to probe questions of religion, commitment, and moral growth -- all without losing the playfully filthy sense of humor marked by its name."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag is, undoubtedly, one of the most challenging TV products that have been made so far. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Fleabag,1,"Every single minute of it is pure gold. Wait, what's better than gold? Platinum. It's pure platinum."
Fleabag,1,'Fleabag' has hit me the way the best books do. [Full Review in Spanish]
Fleabag,1,"An impossible love story, but full - really full - of hilarious and warm moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
Fleabag,1,Creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a genius who has added sharp wit and dark humour in a style we've never seen before
Fleabag,1,The tension between actor and audience reaches a limit point in the final chapter. The show must end. The break closes the series in a moving way. [Full Review in Spanish]
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag is an urgently hilarious series drawing pathos from the minute details of sisterly dynamics, fiercely feminist driven dialogue that's painful and self-reflectively honest, and sight gags such a cafe filled to the brim with guinea pig decor."
Fleabag,1,"It's another to see it demonstrated artfully, holistically, and undeniably on-screen. By the end of the series, Waller-Bridge may as well be reaching through the camera to shake those of us who trust pain more than love back to life."
Fleabag,1,"If the first season was about honestly coming to terms with the damage sex can do, season two is about accepting what comes after confession, about the hard work of loving, even knowing the damage that love has brought and will bring again."
Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge delivers an outstanding performance, managing to raise the stakes in Season 2."
Fleabag,1,"After more than two years, Waller-Bridge delivers Fleabag's second coming and she allows her character to grow in such unexpected ways that I am tempted to say it's even better than the first season."
Fleabag,1,"In an entertainment landscape that rarely grants women characters the range to be challenging, Fleabag's commitment to exploring the sisters' anxieties about (and slow progress toward) one another is a breath of fresh air."
Fleabag,1,I haven't seen anything as rivetingly good on a small screen in as long as I can remember.
Fleabag,1,"Packaging them, turning them into a story, is also a way to control her feelings. Fleabag gives us Fleabag as a gift, so she doesn't have to deal with it herself."
Fleabag,1,Watching her slowly let down that guard and welcome people in finds Fleabag at its most heartwarming and inspiring-two adjectives I never thought I would use to describe this show.
Fleabag,1,Phoebe Waller-Bridge reclaims the idea of female coping in Fleabag. It remains a mordant exploration of what comes into play when women aren't made to obsess over terminating the umbilical cord of pain.
Fleabag,1,It's one of the best seasons of TV I've seen in ages.
Fleabag,1,"The writing here is bitter, sweet, truthful and empathetic. The performances are brilliantly judged from top-notch actors who know exactly when to play it straight and when to go for the funny."
Fleabag,1,What Waller-Bridge does with a familiar British comedy trope is explosive.
Fleabag,1,"The second season of Fleabag perfectly builds on the rich, heartbreaking character study that Waller-Bridge created."
Fleabag,1,"As in Killing Eve, Waller-Bridge always makes sure even her worst characters have moments of vulnerability and humanity, that they have the possibilities that life's pencils and its erasers provide in equal measures."
Fleabag,1,"The driving melancholic overtones of Season 1 are replaced with a reassuring sense of hope as the show's creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, focuses on the ups and downs of love."
Fleabag,1,Fleabag's parting shot manages to feel both definitive and strangely uplifting.
Fleabag,1,"Her writing remains as confident and her humor as cutting as ever - these episodes give us some of the funniest TV moments going right now, and may be the year's best."
Fleabag,1,"'Fleabag' comes to an end with an excellent second season that mixes humor, love, religion and bad milk. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Fleabag,1,One of the most picture-perfect seasons of television that's ever graced us on the small screen.
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag (both the character and the series) find the necessary ingredient that takes the story to a logical, emotionally satisfying conclusion and one that, in many ways, surpasses even that which came before."
Fleabag,1,[Fleabag season 2] paints a funny and quietly devastating portrait of women and the choices they face.
Fleabag,1,Phoebe Waller-Bridge's droll British comedy ascends to heavenly levels of humor thanks to sharp performances and heartfelt observation.
Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge is working with a much more vivid canvas, cutting even deeper by keeping it all so painfully real. Don't miss this show."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag is a hilarious series, and also one with a lot to say about grieving and trying and failing and trying and failing and trying again."
Fleabag,1,"While all six episodes are good, I want to single out the third as one of the greatest episodes of television I've ever seen."
Fleabag,1,"For a character utterly obsessed with the violence that crawls under the surface of politesse, it's a rare moment of harmony between her inner and outer selves."
Fleabag,1,"We all know someone like Fleabag. And we're all capable of empathy. The very existence of this show depends on it. Creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has absolute faith in us. Had she not, Fleabag wouldn't have worked."
Fleabag,1,"Too many modern TV shows are obsessed with depicting how we can fall apart... Give me a hundred TV shows like Fleabag: deeply fascinated with how we put ourselves back together, a much more impressive feat."
Fleabag,1,"Exquisitely crafted in every line and shot, it's unflinchingly mordant in its heightened depiction of everyday awfulness, but it retains at its core a vulnerable, longing sweetness you mightn't think capable of coexisting."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag Season 2, which I cannot recommend highly enough, is thrillingly deep, funny, and buoyant."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag is a raw and impactful series, and in its second season, Phoebe Waller-Bridge can bring her character's voice to a natural and beautiful conclusion."
Fleabag,1,"The first season was always meant to stand alone. That the second... is so successfully additive and so satisfyingly final in its conclusion, feels like a minor miracle."
Fleabag,1,"A portrait of grief, fear, and love that's startling, painful, achingly funny, unbearably sexy, pretty much perfect, and somehow better than the first season. It is a marvel. It should not exist."
Fleabag,1,"Season two is somehow better than the first, and Waller-Bridge's ability to blend comedy and tragedy -- often in the same scene -- makes this show unlike anything else on television right now."
Fleabag,1,"I's a spellbinding performance. But Waller-Bridge also writes generously for her gifted cast. Even Claire's skeevy, selfish husband, Martin (Brett Gelman, who has a Ph.D. in skeeve) has a moment of late clarity."
Fleabag,1,"Scott is immensely likable, and it's not hard to see how Fleabag would fall for him (as ridiculous as that may sound), but where the series ultimately takes this connection seems sketchily thought out rather than fully realized."
Fleabag,1,"Laughs, whimsy, English eccentricity and far too much fun. I was gasping."
Fleabag,1,"Not a single scene or line is wasted. As messy as its protagonist might be, Fleabag season two is tidy and compact and perfect."
Fleabag,1,"It is brilliant physical comedy, which she translates to television with a kind of gangly, Buster Keaton-esque energy."
Fleabag,1,Among Fleabag's great joys is its ability to be gut-bustingly funny while exploring its main character's very real and obvious suffering. That gift is on ample display from the season's first minute to its last.
Fleabag,1,"Throughout this magnificent second season, Fleabag buzzes with life."
Fleabag,1,"Clifford and Waller-Bridge are a transcendent sister act. And the spiritual plotline is transgressive, even Bergman-esque."
Fleabag,1,"Despite a more straightforward approach, the series still boasts Phoebe Waller-Bridge's unmistakable voice."
Fleabag,1,"Season 2 is a towering accomplishment, proving what many have suspected since her debut: Waller-Bridge is operating on a higher plane, and she's kind enough to take the audience along with her."
Fleabag,1,"Perhaps the best six consecutive episodes of a television show you'll watch all year. And without a doubt, the sexiest."
Fleabag,1,A work of genius.
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag has frequently been outrageously, filthily, laugh-out-loud hilarious. But the for the most part the tone of the finale was melancholy and bittersweet...It was a sublime sign-off."
Fleabag,1,"In Fleabag there are no 'strong female characters.' Instead Waller-Bridge creates a space in which women get to be as pathetic, crude, gross and hostile as they want."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag...once more showed its class, with a terrific cameo from Kristin Scott Thomas...and a final scene in which Andrew Scott's sublimely engaging priest explained to Fleabag why he wouldn't have sex with her."
Fleabag,1,"So The Thorn Birds got there first, but the devilishly good Waller-Bridge is sure to have the best jokes."
Fleabag,1,"As before, though, the most pitch-perfect relationship is the love-hate one with the spiky, perfectionist sister Claire."
Fleabag,1,You could tell it was going to be brilliant from the first three seconds.
Fleabag,1,It is warped yet affecting. It is filthy yet elegant. It is funny yet painful.
Fleabag,1,"While I felt the first series flagged slightly towards the end, this was a dark, stylish return - the telly staple of a tense family celebration, but with sudden twists and writing so sharp it could scratch your eyes out."
Fleabag,1,"It takes courage to throw mentions of paedophilia, alcoholism and miscarriage into a comedy mix, but Waller-Bridge is adept at pushing the button just hard enough, stopping short of gratuitous shock tactics."
Fleabag,1,"The vivid portraits of human frailty, weakness and - in Martin's case - near-evil... drawn with just a handful of lines each from an unflinching, excoriating, lethally funny writer whose performers knock every one out of the park."
Fleabag,1,"Fleabag's back, and it's better than ever."
Fleabag,1,"It is a show full of nihilism that runs on optimism. You believe, because the writer wants this too, that her creations will be happy again."
Fleabag,1,Waller-Bridge constructs the show so tightly that there is not a single extraneous scene.
Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge, the queen of penning excruciatingly intense, passive aggressive family dinner situations, is back - and with a delightful vengeance."
Fleabag,1,"My relationship with Fleabag continues to be intense. I adore its star, who looks like a portrait by Meredith Frampton come to life, and I can never get over its emotional precision."
Fleabag,1,"While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude."
Fleabag,1,"What I can say is that this is perfectly paced TV -- funny, moving, unpredictable."
Fleabag,1,Leaves you feeling as though a stranger has just pressed something very precious and very secret into the palm of your hand.
Fleabag,1,"There were enough jokes about pedophiles, miscarriages, alcoholics, lewd sex acts and Catholic priests in Fleabag's second series opener to keep the Points Of View postbag bulging for a year."
Fleabag,1,"Waller-Bridge hasn't rested on her laurels and, like all the best writers, is offering something familiar yet intriguingly different."
Fleabag,1,[A] second series of Fleabag that opened with an episode so gobsmackingly good that I wanted to give [Phoebe Waller-Bridge] a standing ovation in my living room when I watched it for the second time.
Fleabag,1,"Happily, Waller-Bridge has toned down on the to-camera gestures, nods, winks and soliloquies that often bordered on the irritating, letting the terror unfold without the same level of fourth-wall breaking interventions."
Fleabag,1,"If addiction is jeopardy, Waller-Bridge has created a show that mirrors that. She's a skilled actress, but the writing is as cruel as glass."
Rise,1,"Geniune and raw, this NBC drama features an eclectic group of great characters and a strong plot that keeps the proceedings moving along."
Rise,0,"Rise is well-written, hopeful, and considerably more mild than Spring Awakening (this is network TV, after all), but it's still overly sexualized."
Rise,0,"The messages of class disparity, a small town in an economic downturn and the power of a musical never coalesce."
Rise,1,[The show] does a nice job of showing the world just how important the arts are to children.
Rise,0,"... the stakes are so low on this show that any moment of drama, any monologue unrolled by Radnor or one of the other stars, feels more sanctimonious than emotionally impactful."
Rise,1,"There are no easy answers in Rise, but there's a lot of heart and a good deal of food for thought."
Rise,1,"This series is clearly Katims' turn to dream: of a world where the arts inspire the same kind of roaring passion as sports, with self-actualization replacing concussions."
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
Rise,1,"Like that of the New Directions on Glee, Stanton High School's drama department is made up of much diversity and various backgrounds. But watching their differences come together onscreen for one cause is truly magical."
Rise,1,"The story and its adult protagonist in particular are still finding their footing, but strong performances from its soon-to-be-stars make Rise worth the ride. When the younger members of the cast are allowed to take center stage, the show sings, too."
Rise,1,"Rise is up there as one of the best new shows, and that's down to the first class acting, relatable characters and an exciting subject matter. If you thought about overlooking this show, you should give it a shot. You will not be disappointed."
Rise,0,"The audience doesn't get the chance to discover the students' strengths along with the characters...The way Rise unfolds now, there's no tension and no release. Events just happen one after the other."
Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential."
Rise,0,"Mr. Mazzu is like Rise itself: sweet, earnest, cloying, and also obnoxious."
Rise,0,"Welcome to NBC's Rise, a new series that suffers from some very significant pilot-itis."
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
Rise,1,"Tender, lovely series is ""Friday Night Lights"" onstage."
Rise,1,"When Rise finds its stride and lets its kids hit their high notes, it can be breathtaking. But the show has one huge anchor of a problem that keeps it from truly taking off. Rise's supposedly inspirational teacher is a patronizing nightmare."
Rise,1,"I still feel like I bought tickets to a Broadway show I really, really wanted to see and I didn't get my money's worth. That being said, I couldn't stop watching. So there's definitely something here. I'm just waiting for [it] to rise to its potential."
Rise,1,"It's powerful stuff, a testament to what great theater can do. And, I suppose, what decent TV can sometimes do, too."
Rise,0,Imagine if Glee and Friday Night Lights had a baby and that child overdosed on Lifetime movies.
Rise,0,"... Rise feels like a rehash, a collection of stories we've already seen, presented with a slightly darker palette."
Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line."
Rise,1,"What concerns me, after watching the first half of this first season of Rise, is that so many characters are stock, and virtually every plot point is easily and disappointingly telegraphed and predictable."
Rise,1,"Despite its flaws, Rise does a commendable job of evoking that feeling and many of the other complications that accompany the transition from adolescence to adulthood."
Rise,1,"It is predictable, sometimes down to individual lines; the title itself gives the arc away. But predictability is part of what makes musical theater tick; it delivers the thrill the crowd comes for, dramatic tension leading to inspirational release."
Rise,0,"The writers rely too heavily on the cliches to develop characters, which leaves many of them underdeveloped or inconsistent."
Rise,1,"When Rise works best, it's invariably placing these kids at the center; when it stumbles, it's nearly always because the series chooses to tell us how inspired they should be, rather than showing us what happens when they're inspired."
Rise,0,"Yes, a talented, experienced, ""difficult"" woman was passed over for a job because an amateurish white guy woke up one day and decided he wanted to switch career paths."
Rise,1,"... it's heartfelt from start to finish while also offering an overall feel-good respite from television's ongoing obsessions with ""true crime""..."
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
Rise,1,"Rise deserves praise for reminding us how difficult it is to put on a show, unlike Glee's tuneful fantasias."
Rise,1,"In a sense, the show itself is a rumination on whether a song would be enough to bridge any number of American divides. Part of the appeal of Rise is that it sure would be nice to think so."
Rise,1,What Rise has going for it is an honesty that prevents it from falling into the traps in which Glee frequently became stuck.
Rise,1,"That timeliness gives the series added relevance, and it grounds the story in reality. The motivated, uplifting kids in ""Rise"" aren't too good to be true."
Rise,1,Rise is a soap opera as much as it is a prestige drama that will be a great follow-up to This is Us. So don't let the soap-opera fact deter you from giving it a shot.
Rise,1,Stick with it. It's worth it.
Rise,1,"By the end of its first season, Rise starts to provide the cathartic tears, downy blankets of warmth and stirring swells of inspiration the genre demands. There are just a lot of rough patches and a lot of wanting to strangle Mr. Mazzu to get through."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Shedding a harsh, and much-needed, light on the stress and mental health issues faced by many medical providers, this is a series that could not be more appropriate for the times."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,This Is Going to Hurt is likely more accurate and more wrenching than most medical dramas that have aired on TV. But that doesn't mean that it's seeing the fullness of what's wrong with women's health care.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Hopefully, This is Going to Hurt will get more people to talk about our utterly broken institutions so we can finally do something about it before it is too late."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Unflinchingly honest, disparagingly relatable, and undeniably funny, “This is Going to Hurt” is a much-needed examination of the NHS and the trials of working in medicine."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,The best new show of the summer.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,It's setting a sardonic tone of gallows humor that helps amuse the viewer amid the barrage of graphic medical crises and heartbreak that tests the doctors’ resolve.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"It’s a remarkable series not just for what it says but for how it says it, but most of all, for how it so effectively highlights the real human stakes involved in medicine."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,Whishaw's innate charm and wit keep the tone from becoming too depressing.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"This is Going to Hurt sometimes feels like a howl of despair beneath its quippy veneer. Luckily, the howler is played by Whishaw, who has practically has a PhD in playing fragile characters."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,A much-needed small masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Whishaw is wickedly funny, and anchors this traumatically sweet series."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Hurt is the best medical drama in years because, instead of celebrating idealized superhuman doctors, it observes how broken systems force real doctors to attempt superhuman feats."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The talent of Ben Whishaw shines on its highest beams in this medical series about Adam Kay, who left his career as a junior doctor in obstetrics at a London hospital to fictionalize his life into a comedy of shocking gravity. You’ll laugh till it hurts."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Reinvigorating the medical drama is a tall order, but Kay's flair for gallows humor, which comes through in his memoir, and the stellar performances from Whishaw and Mod especially, make it work."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"It is, in a word, spectacular; different from the book, as it needed to be, but every bit as effective in conveying the central theme while still being hugely funny and hugely watchable."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"It’s smart, funny, touching and above all human and compassionate."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,It’s been a while since TV has had a great hospital drama. This Is Going to Hurt definitely qualifies.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"What we have here is a show that resists any clinical appraisal. But it is engaging, witty and intelligently caustic."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,One of the best medical dramas to hit the small screen in years.
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"It’s akin to watching an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” or “Chicago Med” or “New Amsterdam” or “The Resident” et al., only spread out over seven episodes instead of a 44-minute storyline."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"A sometimes relentless, exhausting, but fascinating ride."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"A series well balanced in drama and great acting.
[Full review in Spanish]"
This Is Going to Hurt,1,This drama is electric to watch and is full to the brim of dark humour. It also explores issues that the NHS has been facing for a long time.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The humour is scalpel sharp, and the cast, Whishaw to the fore, perfect fits for their roles. Like the book, the drama can switch in a heartbeat from comedy to tragedy and back again without missing a beat."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Quite simply, one of the finest depictions of the NHS we have perhaps ever seen on screen."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,It just about manages to balance horrors with human warmth and springs a few shocks even on those who’ve read the book or seen Kay’s show.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Darkly funny (very), gory, despairing, riveting, tender and insightful."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"I simply adored this series — it is a dark and cynically funny whirlwind through forceps, “blowholes”, bodily fluids and prolapses."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,A British medical dramedy that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"At times, the first episode did stray into BBC piety... Happily, though, such moments were more than made up for by the crunching finale."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,One of the best of the year so far.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"These tonal shifts might have ended up a bit “Alton Towers"" in less assured hands, but Whishaw is such an engaging performer that the whole thing feels effortlessly authentic."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"The drama excels... showing us how overworked and under pressure these young doctors are, and how much they’re winging it with no experience and not much clue what they’re doing."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Very few dramas manage convincingly to pull off making you laugh out loud one moment and feel profoundly sad the next. Ricky Gervais is the master of this with After Life, and This Is Going to Hurt achieves a similar feat in being painfully funny."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,It invites us all to re-evaluate and understand just how much this must be hurting now.
This Is Going to Hurt,1,"Mixing tragedy and comedy to stunningly powerful effect, former doctor Adam Kay turns his own experiences into the stuff of TV gold while showing us the stark reality of a routinely under-funded, over-stretched NHS."
This Is Going to Hurt,1,The wryly funny Ben Whishaw captivates in this unflinching and exhausting snapshot of a doctor’s life...
This Is Going to Hurt,1,One of the show's greatest strengths is the way it delicately balances drama and comedy throughout.
The Walking Dead,1,"The Final Season is The Walking Dead like you've never seen it before. Even at the beginning of the end, The Walking Dead isn't dying  it's living again."
The Walking Dead,1,The Walking Dead really did go far enough to create compelling reasons to see how things get resolved.
The Walking Dead,1,"Both episodes end on satisfying cliffhangers - the first of which is resolved right away at the start of episode two - but they're still missing some of the wow factor that usually makes a ""TWD"" premiere feel special."
The Mist,1,"The Mist has provided solid entertainment, concisely defined characters and intriguing situations from which a second run is more or less guaranteed."
The Mist,0,"The Mist is one of the most disappointing series of the summer. I had great hopes for this adaptation of the classic King story, but unfortunately, it didn't meet any of my expectations."
The Mist,1,"Spike's new series based on ""The Mist"" (which was made into a Frank Darabont film in 2007, with a controversial altered ending) wasn't written by King, but it does the author proud."
The Mist,1,"It is a well-made, if somewhat dour, creep show that delivers the shocks and awfulness you would be watching for in the first place and manages some decent dialogue in between."
The Mist,0,"Not nearly enough horror, way too much exposition (in the opener). Even the fog seems a little bored hanging around for something to happen."
The Mist,0,"Like King's last TV series, ""Under the Dome,"" ""The Mist"" would seem to have a short shelf life. One hour with these people and you'll be rooting for the critters."
The Mist,1,"Overall, the first episode of the Spike series does a fine job setting up its central characters."
The Mist,0,"The Mist scatters a growing number of flat, unsympathetic characters across various locations and fails to manage the swath of social issues it attempts to tackle."
The Mist,1,"The meaningful part of The Mist comes from the ways people falsely perceive each other, and hurt themselves in the process."
The Mist,1,The Mist is a beautiful blend of drama and horror that delivers on its immediate promise.
The Mist,0,It's a shame the potential of King's classic story is squandered on an uninspired script and bland performances.
The Mist,1,"This Spike TV show takes just as much interest in the reactions of seemingly sane folk to imminent danger as the nature of that danger itself, pairing the chills of horror with a considered psychological component."
The Mist,0,"The show is certainly trying its damnedest to present the dark underbelly of a beautiful town a la Twin Peaks, but the predictable characters don't make it feel like anything new."
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
The Mist,1,"I'm intrigued. And there are only 10 episodes (unless there's a second season), so it might be worth the time investment."
The Mist,1,"So far, the good definitely outweighs the bad, in my book."
The Mist,0,"The series... plays around with elements familiar to members of King's devoted fan base, as well as those from Frank Darabont's intense and somber 2007 feature film of the same name, but with less successful results."
The Mist,1,"When the violence comes, it arrives from the blue without warning."
The Mist,1,"The Mist could be a satisfyingly complex chiller, scaring viewers not just with unexpected jumps and amped-up creepy crawlies, but with the more human monsters who are all trapped together inside, waiting out the weather."
The Mist,1,"Whether the series will surprise me with deeper meaning or retain its high-octane schlock value, I'm up for either."
The Mist,1,There's something in the mist. And we're off!
The Mist,0,"Episode one's more of a family drama than a thriller, and unfortunately the family at the center of the action is not at all compelling."
The Mist,1,"The original movie surprised viewers with low expectations, and the TV version just might do the same."
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
The Mist,1,The acting is no great shakes but the special effects and overall atmosphere are overriding plusses.
The Mist,1,It expands the sociological scope of King's original tale in a manner more assured than that of CBS's 2013-2015 King series Under the Dome.
The Mist,0,Making sense of this mess is probably impossible and not worth the effort.
The Mist,1,"This new Stephen King adaptation comes equipped with a fair share of formulaic storylines and underdeveloped characters. Still, there is enough mystery and gore to keep the horror fans coming back for more."
The Mist,0,"To basically every character in The Mist, allow me to paraphrase the hero of the movie version of a different Stephen King novella: Get busy being better written, or get busy dying."
The Mist,0,"The horror genre is jam-packed with spine-tingling tales, which makes The Mist nothing more than a light fog."
The Mist,1,"So far, The Mist hasn't given viewers much to care about. It's all pretty standard plot thickeners. On the other hand, it's not badly done - atmospheric, so to speak, if unseen horrors are your thing."
The Mist,1,"The Mist has proved that it can bring the frights when it comes to monsters; only time will tell if it can do the same with the people of Bridgeville. Given what we see of certain characters early on, I'm optimistic."
The Mist,1,The Mist might just be an opening act for a run at real relevance.
The Mist,1,"The first episode is an excellent example of the power of human nature as horror, but only time will tell if The Mist can avoid disappearing into the fog of failed TV."
The Mist,1,"A solid reimagining of the Stephen King novella of the same name, The Mist is an intriguing new example of scary TV."
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
The Mist,1,"Yes, there's blood, and creepy crawly things to make your skin crawl a little, but there's nothing to make you want to turn your head away yet."
The Mist,0,The pilot episode doesn't inspire hopes that Torpe can handle a nuanced mix of horror and metaphorical context.
The Mist,1,"What will determine whether ""The Mist"" is the summer hit it aspires to be isn't the gore: It's the effectiveness of the psychological terror. It is moderately successful in the first episode, at least."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
The Mist,1,"This grounded and realistic introduction to a relatable cast of characters goes a long way toward getting audiences invested in them, all the better to respond to the horror that's about to come."
The Mist,0,"The only times The Mist manages to escape the obvious is in the story of a possible teen sexual assault, which feels slightly more rooted in character and reality but takes a backseat to the show's title malevolent force."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
The Mist,0,"This version tries to have it both ways - goofy and serious - and leaves viewers on the outside looking in, rooting for the mist instead of those running from it."
The Mist,1,"Escapism at its finest, The Mist is a excellent reinvention of Stephen King's novella that looks set to deliver a character drama married to a gorgeous thriller. With production values of the highest order, television has come a long way indeed."
The Mist,1,"The cinematography here is excellent, creating a foreboding atmosphere, and the cast is, by turns, clueless, shrill, heroic, stunned and angry - King's usual recipe for horror."
The Expanse,1,"While it's clear there are many more stories that this universe wants to tell, The Expanse ends strong on a message that despite humanity's deeply ingrained flaws, we can still manage to be greater than the sum of our parts."
The Expanse,1,"""The Expanse is a once-in-a-lifetime series ... The curators of this show bless us with six consistently incredible seasons, rich with intricate sci-fi magic, tour de force performances, stunning visuals, and a gripping story."""
The Expanse,1,"For all the worthy comparisons to Game of Thrones, theres one thing The Expanse achieved that its HBO counterpart couldnt: This show stuck the landing."
The Expanse,1,"A strong send-off, with hope for the future."
The Expanse,1,"In only six episodes, the final season of The Expanse somehow manages to drive home a coherent thesis about social ethics while making use of all the plotlines they left dangling."
The Expanse,1,Expanse goes out in style with six episodes that tie up the ongoing plotline very well. It also heavily teases the next big plotline which is odd given it's the final season!
The Expanse,1,"In [numerous] respects, Season 6 of The Expanse is as consistent, thrilling, and entertaining as the five seasons that preceded it."
The Expanse,1,"Like HBO's The Wire, The Expanse is a series that deserves a much wider audience than it has ever had and now I hope people will go back and binge the entire epic journey."
The Expanse,1,The best science fiction series of the past decade is going out on (mostly) its own terms.
The Expanse,1,"Nailing a TV finale is no easy feat -- just look at Lost's oft-mocked ending and the disappointing disaster that was Game of Thrones' coda. But with its sixth and final season, The Expanse is the rare genre series that pulls it off."
The Expanse,1,"While it rushes at times, [the show] usually manages to deliver something that lives up to expectations, confirming the series as one of the best examples of television science fiction so far this century. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Expanse,1,"Now, as the story makes its last stand, showrunner Naren Shankar steers us back to the basic plea for all of us recognize our shared humanity."
The Expanse,1,"The Expanse Season 6 is an appropriate send-off to what is quietly one of the best TV series out there, and, even so, it still feels like the show is just getting started."
The Expanse,1,The Expanse ends well in part because it doesn't try to provide a true ending to the conflicts it's explored for six seasons.
The Expanse,1,"The Expanse begins its final chapter with thrills and ultimatums...it's finally returned-for just six episodes, but at this point any Expanse is better than no Expanse..."
The Expanse,0,"The season feels incomplete, an insufficient and far too economical kiss off for such an intricately constructed show. It's sad to see a world built with the breadth of the universe have no room to breathe."
The Expanse,1,"It's not exactly unfinished business, but this season is marked by the confidence of a show that's got six seasons under its belt and still doesn't particularly feel like stopping, no matter what any official announcement might say."
The Expanse,1,"This premiere is a stage-resetter, like late-season premieres often are. But because it's The Expanse, it's full of rich and vivid character work that turns the gears of space politics."
The Expanse,1,"It might be best to head into the sixth season with moderate expectations when it comes to the grand finale. Think less ""grand"" and more ""functional."""
The Expanse,1,"The Expanse's final season is short on episodes and on character development, which is a shame."
The Expanse,1,"An intense season with high stakes that will have everyone on the edge of their seats. Character arcs are completed well, but with just six episodes it feels rushed."
The Flash,1,"There is just enough excitement to get us to the next episode without making things too overly convoluted. Hopefully, it stays that way."
P-Valley,1,... It's already claimed its spot among my favorite shows of this year.
P-Valley,1,"Soapiness still drives P-Valley,  along with the dancers' aerial daring... These, combined with each scene's crisp, tart dialogue, keep it fresh and entertaining in ways that making it incomparable to much else on TV."
P-Valley,1,Real-world events figure prominently as the show deftly avoids a sophomore slump and rises to its occasion.
P-Valley,0,"P-Valley pivots almost exclusively toward anguish and the tension between crime and punishment, and that thematic swing... overwhelms and undermines already-established plots."
P-Valley,1,"Season two is funnier than the first, going further into its campiness, but it also feels as if it is now fully at ease with itself."
P-Valley,1,"One of the reasons I love 'P-Valley', particularly season two, is how the show portrays the dancers as human beings, and not as stereotypes. All of the episodes in season one were directed by women and it shows."
P-Valley,1,Cleverly tackles recent events with its own uniquely pungent voice.
P-Valley,1,P-Valley season two is full of emotional roller-coasters and character situations that the fans have come to expect and love.
P-Valley,1,"Incorporating the pandemic is a risk for any TV series, but P-Valley isn't the type of show that takes the easy way out."
Gaslit,1,... Finds a fair equilibrium in recreating those tragic and farcical times that defined the end of Nixon's government. [Full review in Spanish]
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit moves…with consistent satire, at times it can be disturbing and dark. [Full review in Spanish]"
Gaslit,1,"Addictive and intriguing, Julia Roberts and Sean Penn deliver Emmy-worthy performances in Robbie Pickering's timely indictment of Washington D.C.'s culture of complicity and cultural bitterness."
Gaslit,1,Roberts is magnetic as the gossipmonger turned voice of dissent.
Gaslit,1,"My new obsession is this vivid recreation of the 1970s Watergate era, when all eyes turned to Washington, D.C. for the biggest TV show of its day: the nationally televised Watergate hearings."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit may look at Watergate with a fresh lens, but the lessons are deeply relevant."
Gaslit,1,"What pleases me most, and what makes Gaslit a series that shines is its humor. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit does justice to Martha Mitchell’s robbed legacy but it also contextualises her fate within the larger social and cultural forces of the time, vividly recreating the paranoia, power plays and cynicism of the political process."
Gaslit,1,Sporadically amusing.
Gaslit,1,"The eight-episode Gaslit does seem a bit overstuffed, but is always engaging and comes at the right time to remind viewers that 50 years ago, when so many people lost their spine, others also grew one."
Gaslit,1,"The creative team has produced a series that, based on the first seven episodes, begins with almost satiric tones of dark humor and evolves into something darker and more intense."
Gaslit,1,"The actors traverse a wide variety of styles, from sardonic satire to raw sincerity. While that stylistic range can feel indecisive in some episodes, it’s an awfully good cast."
Gaslit,1,"The superb and sometimes slippery performance from the Downton Abbey alum [Dan Stevens] puts Dean in a whole new -- and, let's be honest, unflattering -- light."
Gaslit,1,How such a rip-roaring limited series ended up on Starz instead of a more prestigious platform is a real mystery.
Gaslit,1,"While dealing with such an episode from recent history that has likely been done to death, you do need a fresh perspective. And here, Gaslit and its creator Robbie Pickering excel."
Gaslit,1,"Stream it, but only for the performances of Roberts, Penn and the rest of the cast of Gaslit. The series leans too hard on the farcical to help viewers come away with any real information about the Republican side of the Watergate scandal."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit wants to be many things, which bogs it down, and it has marketed itself as whistleblower Martha's story, which it isn't, really. It's a lot of stories. It's a time capsule, a not completely historically accurate one, but one stuffed full."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
Gaslit,1,"An excellent cast holds together a strangely discordant mix of saccharine romantic scenes and over-the-top plots, digging into the weirder corners of American history with an absurdism that fits the current political climate."
Gaslit,1,"The political aspect of this story is like Succession by way of Spitting Image  Stevens is Cousin Gregging all over the place, and Penn looks like one of the puppets."
Gaslit,1,"Theres a poignant lesson in there about sycophancy, and how irrelevant it is in the long run."
Gaslit,1,"Once it begins to grip, it doesn’t let go. Gaslit has taken its ample ingredients and turned them into a very good, very watchable drama that steadily finds its feet."
Gaslit,1,"For those who like to get into the nitty-gritty of history, this is illuminating stuff."
Gaslit,1,"The script has bounce, revealing its panoramic ensemble with energy and assurance."
Gaslit,0,"If the series accomplishes nothing else, it’s guaranteed to teach a few audience members stories they didn’t know before. It’s just too bad that in its messiness, Gaslit stops somewhere short of doing them justice."
Gaslit,1,"A perennially timely tale, and great TV."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit is a valuable reminder that in the matter of Watergate, she was on the right side of history."
Gaslit,0,"The entire time I watched Gaslit, I ricocheted between thinking it was a thought-provoking series full of memorable performances and that it was a terrible series that too frequently felt like a Saturday Night Live skit."
Gaslit,1,"The acting in Gaslit never quits -- but let’s be honest, you’re coming for Julia Roberts and she doesn’t disappoint."
Gaslit,1,"Funny, fierce and even occasionally profound..."
Gaslit,1,"An Emmy worthy Julia Roberts comes out blazing in this riveting series about loud and proud Martha Mitchell, the wife of Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell (Sean Penn) who was  discredited as a delusional drunk for speaking the truth about Watergate"
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
Gaslit,1,Roberts and Penn’s sizzling chemistry contribute to the high entertainment value of Gaslit.
Gaslit,1,"As odd as it may sound, no filmshow has delved into a portrait of the perpetrators (beyond Nixon) behind the Watergate scandal. And thats where Gaslit captures the conversation in an effective way."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit works because it isn't only about the Watergate break-in - in the show, it occurs as early as in Episode 2 - but also about the people whose lives and careers were made or unmade by the scandal."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit is crafted with enough style to dimly distinguish itself, even if its substance is more familiar than I’d hoped it would be."
Gaslit,1,Gaslit is a wickedly entertaining and irreverent look at an infamous slice of American history that none of these characters are particularly proud to be a part of.
Gaslit,0,"The particularities of the way Nixonian paranoia played itself out over the national landscape defy easy comparison, and yet the show makes frequent, flat gestures towards the modern day."
Gaslit,1,It’s a stranger-than-fiction true story that tries to find the halfway point between historical drama and absurdist dark comedy. It’s not always successful but Roberts’ all-in performance and those of her co-stars... are a delight
Gaslit,1,Gaslit provides a surprisingly engrossing counter to the established narrative by mostly ignoring it.
Gaslit,1,"Losing a bit of momentum down the stretch thanks in part to its diffused storylines and semi-satirical tone, it's still an extremely well-cast look at the presidential scandal that made the suffix ""gate"" part of our lexicon."
Gaslit,1,"The rare show that has loads of fun bringing history into sharper focus. It takes the names you know, and may have read about, and shows why you should care."
Gaslit,1,"There are some scenes where you will have to avert your gaze from the screen, so palpable is her pain — both physical and psychic — but Roberts wanted and needed to humanize Martha. She has (and how)."
Gaslit,1,"Gaslit is a handsome limited series about a particularly ugly American sensibility. Its warning may be old news, but its means of communicating its point proves compelling."
Gaslit,1,One only wishes creator Robbie Pickering had found a better way to balance this trio of intertwined stories.
Gaslit,1,"Roberts should get her Emmy speech ready, she is that good. She's like Shelby in ""Steel Magnolias"" all grown up and waking up to the horrors of the world around her that men have created. Sean Penn is unrecognizable as her scumbag husband..."
Gaslit,1,[A] snazzy but pandering miniseries...
Gaslit,1,"Even in the construction of a show about the female heroine traversing this wicked narrative, that heroine is cast aside so that the boys get their time to shine."
Gaslit,1,"Julia Roberts is great in Gaslit, but it's Shea Whigham's G. Gordon Liddy who steals the show."
Mr. Robot,1,"Mr. Robot becomes a masterpiece because of this season. With time, the show started focusing inwards rather than outwards and gave us the truest version of character development there is, the one that grows in us. Unmissable. Full review in Spanish"
Mr. Robot,1,"A commentary on the power of connection, whether digital, face-to-face, or physical, Mr Robot entwines technology, alienation and power into an addictive series, showcasing the best work Rami Malek and Christian Slater have ever done."
Mr. Robot,1,...the new season leans into what attracted fans in the first place.
Mr. Robot,1,"Season four, thankfully, seems like it's finally rewarding my faith in the show's long game."
Mr. Robot,1,"Sam Esmail's creation doesn't have the same level of hype it captured during its first season, but it's still willing to take chances and occasionally makes for must-watch television."
Mr. Robot,1,Mr. Robot returned strong with a premiere that pulled no punches.
Mr. Robot,1,Mr. Robot returns vibrant and addictive with plenty of memorable moments. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mr. Robot,1,"Despite its regular references to classic paranoid thrillers, it's not nearly as pessimistic as we might've thought based on Malek's hard-boiled and spiritually exhausted narration."
Mr. Robot,1,"Whoever wins the David vs. Goliath battle, one thing is for certain about the final season of Mr. Robot: It's going to be a bloody Christmas."
Mr. Robot,1,"Rami Malek and Christian Slater are at the top of their game here and if the second half of this season is as good as the first five episodes, fans are going to be very pleased with how this show comes to a close."
Mr. Robot,1,"Mr. Robot is back and better than ever! With plenty of shocking moments and killer twists and turns, the signs are all pointing to the show's final season delivering the answers we've all been waiting for in an exciting and satisfying way."
Mr. Robot,1,"Though the final season announces itself with one successive bummer after another, it creates a level of anticipation that is incredibly hard to deny."
Mr. Robot,1,[Sam] Esmail is one of the few series creators to expertly utilize classic analog cinematic techniques to make the conceptual oppression of surveillance state palpable.
Mr. Robot,1,"Long story short, I couldn't look away."
Mr. Robot,1,The final season of Mr. Robot is starting with a bang and a promise that is going to leave audiences reeling. It's everything we want Mr. Robot to be. It's everything we always thought Mr. Robot could be. It's everything Mr. Robot should be.
Mr. Robot,1,"To be a successful final season, Mr. Robot not only needs to make us believe that Elliot is capable of pulling off the impossible, but that he cares with a deep burning sense of burden and responsibility. Mission accomplished so far."
Mr. Robot,0,"At this moment in time, however, Mr Robot seems just as likely to spend its final episodes chasing its tail."
Mr. Robot,1,"Returning now, after some uneven stretches in Seasons 2 and 3, the show feels as vibrant as ever, with the fifth of the episodes exhibiting the kind of deft, meticulously constructed cloak-and-dagger machinations that would work as a theatrical thriller."
Mr. Robot,1,"It's a strong start, but it's very clearly the end that will matter."
Mr. Robot,1,"Elliot and his alter ego never really kicked off another TV revolution. But for those who've stuck with the series this long, it still offers more conventional pleasures."
Mr. Robot,1,"An apocalyptic fourth, and final, season of the series that takes it to new emotional and visual heights."
Mr. Robot,1,"It cuts its way to success, finding a leaner and more propulsive drama underneath indulgences. Told with typical confidence and flair but with a new note of humility too, the season, at least in its early stages, represents a high note."
Reacher,1,You can’t turn around without running into a new drama starring movie stars that desperately want you to grapple with weighty problems. Thank god for Amazon’s “Reacher.”
Reacher,1,It’s clear that the people who made this love the source books as much as the cameraman likes cooing over Reacher’s naked torso.
Reacher,1,Amazon's streaming reboot of the Tom Cruise film franchise about a wandering ex-military badass is energetic and entertaining -- and fans will be pleased at not having a pipsqueak Reacher.
Reacher,1,"An outstanding Alan Ritchson lives, breathes, and embodies Reacher."
Reacher,1,"The hard-boiled TV episodic is a departure from the Jack Reacher films starring Tom Cruise, and Alan Ritchson's interpretation of the lead role feels more authentic."
Reacher,1,One can imagine this one going on forever.
Reacher,1,"Reacher is great fun, one of those series you look forward to and could happily binge-watch, even though you know it’s not going to add much to your quotient of brain cells."
Reacher,1,"Ritchson’s Hulk-like stature is peak Reacher, and the series excels in resetting the franchise and allowing viewers to see the character in a different light."
Reacher,1,"From the writing to the acting and direction - Reacher is the perfect adaptation of this beloved character that will keep you enthralled from start to finish, sticks the landing and will leave you wanting more."
Reacher,1,"Despite the carnage and brutality, Reacher is grounded in palpable humanity."
Reacher,1,Lee Child knows the character is preposterous. So does this TV show.
Reacher,1,"Reacher is an act of course correction, a chance to get everything right that the Cruise version got wrong – and it succeeds marvellously."
Reacher,1,"Reacher isn’t a game-changer by any means, but if watching a clever, brash, often-shirtless hulk of a man hammer his way through a mystery is your bag, then you’re definitely in for a treat."
Reacher,1,"Harsh but riveting. Reacher deals in death, my friends, and I enjoyed the mystery, the cast, and the head-busting action."
Reacher,1,"The ensemble cast is connected right off the bat, and Alan Ritchsons take on Jack Reacher is deeper than his  Schwarzenegger type body would indicate, but it also means at some point he will be shirtless. Really good action/mystery story, & a great cast."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
Reacher,1,"Reacher is a breezy eight episodes with some great fight scenes, a clear vision of who it wants its protagonist to be, and some solid one-liners along the way."
Reacher,1,"""Reacher"" is a fun show provided you know what you're getting yourself into: the brutal fight scenes; the very specific, very violent, kinds of murder; the stereotypically heinous bad guys."
Reacher,1,"Its a light and breezy crime thriller that doesnt get too serious. And when the action hits, its very exciting. The story is simple enough to follow along, and the characters are interesting and have enough chemistry to keep watching."
Reacher,1,The must see television event of 2022. Ritchson and Fitzgerald make for one of this years most dynamic and interesting TV twosomes.
Reacher,1,"A big, bold, brilliant new series..."
Reacher,1,"What's for sure is that if you like the Reacher books, you'll like the Reacher TV show. The blend that marks the books is present and accounted for."
Reacher,1,Theres undoubtedly more to come from Alan Ritchsons impressive take on the beloved investigator  signalling a bright start to his small-screen adventures.
Reacher,1,"""Authentic, action-packed crime drama with Alan Ritchson instantly recognizable as the imposing, inscrutable powder-keg known as Jack Reacher."""
Reacher,1,"None of this is unpredictable or that original, what works is how “Reacher” delivers what it promises as a TV entertainment in the style of old-school muscled adventures."
Reacher,1,It is safe to say that ‘Reacher’—both the character and this series— is your quintessential modern-day hero.
Reacher,1,Prime Video's original crime series Reacher faithfully brings the hard-hitting literary hero to the small screen in all his hyper-masculine glory.
Reacher,1,Reacher undoes a lot of the things that the films got wrong. It casts a man who looks like the Reacher Lee Child probably envisioned.
Reacher,1,This version of Reacher actually works.
Reacher,1,"Reacher is a worthwhile stream, especially for fans of the genre and the series, and if you aren't someone who has read the books by now, it will inspire you to do so."
Reacher,1,Reacher is a rousing success.
Reacher,1,"Reacher doesn't suffer from any illusions about its objectives, serving up an unpretentious action series that's as much a course correction from the movies as an extension of them."
Reacher,1,"If you're so inclined, allow yourself to be smothered by Reacher's beefy embrace."
Reacher,1,"Like Reacher, Ritchson also feels strikingly new to the area, but you cant stop noticing him. It doesn't get old to watch his brain compute, and see his fists respond."
Reacher,1,"Call me retrograde, but I found Reacher entertaining. It clips right along, is reasonably suspenseful and has a vivid cast."
Reacher,1,Ritchson is the epitome of Reacher.
Reacher,1,"Pour yourself a black coffee, sit back and enjoy."
Reacher,1,"Alan Ritchson is perfectly cast as ""Reacher"" and this series is going to make him a major star. Meanwhile the series itself is pretty near perfect."
Reacher,1,"The show stays within its limits, and the result is an enjoyable weekend hang. If you’re in the mood for a fun, glossy action series that’ll keep you entertained, you’ll enjoy Prime Video’s Reacher."
Reacher,1,The show’s real secret sauce though is in its character interactions and light touch.
Reacher,0,"""Reacher” will never be more interesting than Reacher, and he may have finally found the medium that fits too loosely over his big-and-tall frame."
Reacher,1,"Broken into eight, one-hour-long episodes, Reacher is a series of crests and troughs culminating, much like a ship on the ocean, at a destination far from its original launch point."
Reacher,1,"Among his many specialties, Jack Reacher prides himself on restoring sanctity to profaned places. After spending six years in a potters field of onscreen IP, its nice to see ""Reacher"" restore that glory for the character."
Reacher,1,"Its wonderfully cathartic stuff. In one diner-set altercation, he wraps some poor guys head in a tablecloth and then knocks him into a coma with a rapid succession of elbow strikes. I cheered. Hell, I nearly cried."
Reacher,0,"No nuance, no depth, no originality. In other words: nothing to set it apart."
Reacher,1,"Reacher will have its fans, especially the more patient ones, and to be fair, plot development may just not be my favorite style, so I can leave it with a simple ""let's see."""
Reacher,1,"I enjoyed the fight scenes a lot more than anything in the Cruise movies, but other than that, Reacher is just a serviceable mystery that isn't mysterious enough."
Reacher,1,"Though this first series doesn't end as strongly as it begins, Alan Ritchson showcases the right mix of acting chops and physical presence to successfully bring Lee Child's hero to life."
Reacher,1,"The television equivalent of an airport novel. It's not going to challenge your expectations, but it will fulfill them in a mostly satisfying way."
Reacher,1,"Reacher is dumb, breezy, pulpy, and it knows it. That's the real secret to Santora's sauce."
Reacher,0,"It spends eight episodes paving the way not to hell with its good intentions, but to mediocre television."
Reacher,0,"Ritchson's 12-pack is a physical manifestation of a tonal problem: His Reacher is smarmy and pleased with himself, rather than casually secure in his own vast abilities. He's a generic vigilante who just happens to look like a mountain."
Reacher,1,"By providing a deeper look into a complex character, Reacher could do for Jack Reacher what Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan did for its titular character in another Amazon series: take an existing franchise beloved by many in a fun new direction."
Reacher,1,"Alan Ritchson does not merely have the body type to play Reacher, he understands the character and makes the viewers like him."
Reacher,1,Reacher doesn't commit to that fun side of the character as much as it could.
Reacher,1,This new Jack Reacher steps into a small-town throwdown that's a bit too familiar even if you haven't read the books.
Reacher,1,Reacher's brand of sexy police procedural may be deemed too commercial. It may keep you hooked to your smart TV/tablet/laptop/phone for an evening or two though.
Reacher,1,"I prefer the Amazon version, and I wouldn't mind another season, but I'd probably still rather read another book."
Reacher,1,"Reacher isn't going to light the television world on fire, but it doesn't have to, so it never tries. It delivers its story with precision and allows you to spend real time with some enjoyable characters."
Reacher,1,"Alan Ritchson proves himself one of TV's toughest leading men in Reacher, an exciting, action-packed conspiracy thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat even amidst a few familiar genre trappings."
Reacher,1,"Ritchson feels a little out of place at first but settles in nicely -- and yes, he's better than Tom Cruise. Those who know the story might find it a bit slow at times."
Reacher,0,"Ritchson has the swagger to be an intimidating action hero. His introductory scenes are most effective when he stares down cops and random bullies silently. Unfortunately, once he starts speaking, the show feeds him nothing but cheesy lines."
Reacher,1,"Reacher is a gritty, action packed series that captures the heart of the Jack Reacher series. Alan Ritchson is a great fit for the role, and I have to say that I do look forward to seeing more of him in future seasons."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"The Boys Presents: Diabolical delivers a highly entertaining and visually distinct anthology with a variety of tones, stories, and animation styles."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"It doesnt always hit, and when it does hit it doesnt even pack a particularly hard punch, but its a fun ride and gives in to an unhinged, artist-driven creativity that makes it feel novel."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Without the budgetary constraints that plague live-action, an animated show like Diabolical can push not just taste levels, but also the realms of storytelling itself, expanding The Boys universe in bold, new (and sometimes poopy) ways."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,I appreciate the concept. I appreciate the different artists coming in and doing their own thing.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,The rampant charm and creativity thats on display in every single frame makes The Boys: Diabolical one of the most entertaining series of 2022 and a dream come true for hardcore animation fans.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Aside from a few misfires, the series delivers a solid glance at the larger world Vought's manufactured heroes exist in, offer a few insights into key characters, and delivers something that even the most casual of The Boys viewer can enjoy."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,The series is filled with eccentric characters who can do anything and the common thread that runs through all is that they are highly unpredictable.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Man, this is one twisted franchise, and Diabolical respectably stacks up to its live-action counterpart."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Anthology series are inconsistent by nature, and making that anthology series a spin-off only ups the level of difficulty. Yet nearly every one of the episodes of The Boys Presents: Diabolical is more fully realized than most regular TV shows."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Ultimately, Diabolical is great if you like animation, but you won’t feel lost during The Boys if you skip it. You should still watch “John and Sun-Hee” just because it’s well told and beautifully animated."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"While I wish it was overall more consistent, there is a nice mix of funny, scary, touching, dramatic, and silly. I hope we get additional volumes of this series that give even more unique animators and writers the chance to play in this universe."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"The Boys Presents: Diabolical! is every bit as whacky, violent, and imaginative as fans would expect, yet audiences won’t see it coming."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"With such a limited running time, these stories pack a lot in. They hit the spot more often than not and will satiate your bloodlust while waiting for the main event."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,0,"As with most ventures like this, the total assembly is a very mixed bag of quality, dipping on the negative side of the ledger here overall."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,Diabolical reaches far further heights of crazy than the parent series could even dream of.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"For a good time, skip to “An Animated Short…,” “Boyd in 3D,” “BFFs,” and “John and Sun-Hee.” But really, at a total runtime of two hours, Diabolical will hardly waste your time."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Whether you’re a fan of The Boys or not, you’ll enjoy the animated shorts in The Boys Presents: Diabolical, mainly because they tell good stories with funny character-driven gags."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"With run times less than a quarter of an hour each, it’s perfect for an entertaining evening binge. (Just put the kids to bed first — and don’t eat while watching.)"
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Diabolical offers up something for every variation of The Boys fan, whether theyre looking for a deep dive into the shows mythology, a dramatic tale with emotional heft, or a silly story about a girl with the power to control, well, poop."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Not quite as consistent as I hoped, but a lot better than I feared. Given its frankly mediocre origins, The Boys continues to be much better as a franchise than it has any right to be."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"It's dark and it's jarring, but it's also upsettingly, rivetingly familiar."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"The Boys Presents: Diabolical captures the diversity of storytelling that adult animation has to offer. Its hilariously vulgar, bombastically graphic, and a hell of a good time."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"You may be tempted to watch this ambitious package of shorts in a single sitting, though these animated appetizers are worth savoring for how rich with creativity they are."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"There’s a lot to enjoy in this anthology, which serves as an amuse bouche of sorts while we wait for The Boys to return."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Diabolical is a fantastic group of stories that thrive because of the impressive voice cast, the way they push boundaries, and the varied animation styles."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"This animated series offers bite-sized stories (with episodes clocking in around 10-15 minutes in length) with all the gore, violence, and surprisingly nuanced storytelling weve come to expect from the main series."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,The Boys Presents: Diabolical is a reminder of just how gross and fun a world of superpowered sociopaths can be.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Just as bloody, gore-filled, and vulgar as the live action show, it allows for a new way to see the world of our favorite Supes."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"None of it is required viewing for the main series and non-fans won’t be converted into full-on devotees with this short spinoff. Nevertheless, it’s exciting to see Amazon expand the world of The Boys."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,The Boys Presents: Diabolical is just a bunch of hilariously gory and vulgar short stories set in the explicit and adult world of Eric Kripke's original show.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"There's a little bit of something for every ""The Boys"" fan, whether they're looking for biting social commentary, harsh violence, or just some silly superhero vulgarity."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"These entertaining animated shorts are an amusing diversion but wont bring anything additional to fans of The Boys. Like most anthology shows, not every episode will cater to your tastes or your humour."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Diabolical is meant for fans of the universe, by clear fans of the universe, an ambitious and lighter antidote to the more cynical and dark parent series. The diverse animation styles only enhance the unpredictable storytelling, gags, gore, and fun."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Not every episode hits the mark in The Boys Presents: Diabolical, but there are enough gloriously twisted ideas in this brutal, bloody, and surprisingly thought-provoking anthology series to make it essential viewing for fans of The Boys."
The Wilds,1,"Who watched Season 1 and was like, “This is great, what if we had less of it and more of something completely brand new.”"
The Wilds,1,"Overall, the second season, while not as incredible as the first, is still great, albeit quick, watch. The ending of the season, which provides answers but poses many more questions, is incredible and turns up the heat on the entire series."
The Wilds,1,"The series does an admirable job of juggling all the different balls it has in the air, but it is slightly less focused, and thus less impactful."
The Wilds,1,The story is fruitful ground for the writers to explore many popular assumptions about gender—and destroy them.
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
The Wilds,1,"In Season 2, every aspect I loved about Season 1 is amplified. The teen drama feels real, the survival is gripping, and the plot both pays off the previous cliffhanger and sets up an equally intriguing one."
The Wilds,1,The new addition of male characters adds new names to follow and maybe care for. But it’s the girls who still hold our attention best simply because their characters were already developed and established in the first season.
The Wilds,1,"While The Wilds might be ""kids survive a plane crash"" lite, it's actually more zany than ""Yellowjackets."" If that's your cup of herbal tea, you've struck gold."
The Wilds,1,"While adding boys into the mix takes away some of the singular magic of the first season, The Wilds remains an extremely entertaining and beautifully performed series."
The Wilds,1,"In episode four, “Day 42/15,” the gilt finally comes off the lily, and it does so in a profoundly dark and disturbing fashion."
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
The Wilds,1,"While there are some beautiful, vulnerable dialogues on what it is to connect with someone without appearances and filters, amidst the women’s storylines, Season 2’s male cast is focused on intensely in terms of riveting storylines."
The Wilds,1,"There’s still enough to like here, but the parallels to Lost are strangely more prominent than ever."
The Wilds,1,"The Wilds is making its Season 2 viewing experience dead easy to follow, even as the mystery surrounding the teens’ collective fate only grows more complex."
The Wilds,0,"The introduction of the boys is a failed experiment, and unfortunately, apart from a few good moments and an interesting finale, season 2 is a wasted continuation that offers very little."
The Wilds,1,"...The Wilds Season 2 isn't better than the first, mainly because I don't think they can be directly compared. However, it is strong on its own, and the new group of young actors bring heroism, vulnerability, and compassion..."
The Wilds,1,"The good news is that the women of The Wilds are still intriguing, dynamic, frustrating, and accessible. The bad news is we get way less time with them."
The Wilds,1,"Dropping eight new characters into an already sprawling ensemble is a bold move, but just as it did in season 1, 'The Wilds' draws multiple narrative threads into a taut and twisty rope that pulls viewers along."
The Wilds,1,"Ultimately, “The Wilds” Season 2 is an intense but enjoyable watch that feels crowded at times with 8 new characters."
The Wilds,0,"By starting from scratch with a whole new group of characters, The Wilds bifurcates its focus and renders everything more shallow as a result."
The Wilds,1,"Cathartically overthrowing the bad guys can be fun. But Prime Videos trashy YA adventure series The Wilds takes a surprisingly more subtle, and in many ways more painful approach...the patriarchy is everywhere; theres no one person you can punch."
The Wilds,1,"The girls are as engaging as before, their stories still as interesting, and their development more earned than ever. But we cannot truly say the same of the boys."
The Wilds,1,"As the experiment expands and the main ensemble grows, The Wilds continues to prove it features one of the most talented, must-know cast of up-and-comers out there."
What We Do in the Shadows,1,"Get ready for more drama, an avalanche of raunchy jokes, the creation of a nightclub, and a baby (!) Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch)."
What We Do in the Shadows,1,"What We Do in the Shadows' Season 4 brings the vampires back to Staten Island, highlighting what makes the cast so hilarious and endearing."
What We Do in the Shadows,1,What a gift it is to live in an age when an undead sitcom can flourish.
What We Do in the Shadows,1,"Even in a season that immediately abandons its characters’ ambitions to plop them back in the same old house, there are fresh angles to play."
What We Do in the Shadows,1,"What We Do in the Shadows has always excelled in leveraging its unique blend of absurdist comedy and emotional payoff, and Season 4 is no different."
What We Do in the Shadows,1,A fangtastic return to form.
Shameless,1,"Just like the sprawling, self-sabotaging Gallagher family, Shameless is by turns generous and murderous; tender and wild; often exasperating and occasionally brilliant."
Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.
Shameless,1,The swan song of the Emmy winner still has some surprises up its stain-tattered and still glorious sleeve.
Shameless,1,"The finale is actually a pretty apt metaphor for communities in transition periods. It raises the question of who actually benefits from amenities and development, even if it doesn't answer those questions completely, and there's poignance in that."
Shameless,1,"I love this show, messy flaws, brazen outrageousness, frenetic pacing, offensive story lines, hyper-farcical turns and all. It's not a Breaking Bad or a Mad Men, a pair of near-perfect specimens, but it has the kind of humanity that inspires my devotion."
Shameless,1,Its crudeness and empathy give it a realism that makes the humor both genuinely funny but also challenging.
Shameless,0,"After months of delays, Shameless is back and more uneven than ever... Narratively speaking, there was no direction. A show in its final season should have set up conflicts that need to be resolved by the time the series finale arrives."
Shameless,1,"Is social distancing happening? No freaking way, but I don't think Shameless would work if all of the characters hung out at home. Nor would it seem believable that they could afford to do so."
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
Shameless,1,"These struggles are perfect for the show to cover because the Gallaghers have always managed to find a way with or without money and during the current climate, that struggle is even more extreme."
The Office,1,"As the show moves into its final seasons, the parody eases up and even Jim comes to realize that the office where he spends the majority of his waking hours is where the most significant relationships of his life will be formed."
The Office,1,"There will never be anything else to come along with the exact right balance of deadpan comedy, corporate cynicism and full-blooded heart to fill the hole that The Office left behind."
The Office,0,"The Office has seemed lost, particularly by devoting substantial time to world-building Dwight's beet farm, a remnant of a failed spin-off effort."
The Office,1,"It was just right. For as much as we complained about the latter half of the series and yearned for the Michael Scott years, the ending was more about the fact that you took a journey with these characters."
The Office,1,"You get to the point where you can't stand the sight of the thing that you used to love, and there's a huge relief when you finally decide to end it. But it's then... that the things that you used to love so much decide to reappear."
The Office,0,"It succumbed to the bane of American TV -- the endless more-more-more of anything good or popular, the twisting of characters into pretzels to simply keep them in motion, the cheap substitutes after lead actors depart."
The Office,1,"For nine years now, The Office has provided us with more laughs than we can count, and anyone who doesn't have it on their list of the Top 10 TV comedies of all time needs to redo their list."
The Office,1,"The Office may have lost almost all of its subtly in season eight, but it regained just enough of it to send it off right in season nine."
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
The Office,0,I concluded that I was watching a show that wasn't just winding down. It was being taken off life support.
The Office,1,"I thought it was a fitting finale to the show overall, and if there weren't a lot of [laugh out loud]-worthy jokes, the more emotional elements made up for it."
The Office,1,"Even though its later seasons never lived up to its groundbreaking early explorations of contemporary work culture, what The Office leaves us with are memories of television comedy at its best."
The Office,0,"And so NBC's The Office takes its leave, after overstaying its welcome and most often erring on the side of over-worked sentiment rather than pure comedy."
The Office,1,"When the focus shifts from primary characters to the entire cast, we're reminded that a strong, comedic ensemble still exists."
The Office,1,"It was always the damaged characters who made the show worth watching, and it was the ingenious performances of Mr. Carell as the aggressively clueless boss and Mr. Wilson as his raging acolyte that made it distinctive."
The Office,1,"It is not quite the same show as the one that debuted in March 2005, but it has continued to be a show I watch, grumbling occasionally, with great and in many respects increasing pleasure."
The Office,1,"This was no ordinary television series, and no ordinary season."
The Office,1,"As the series comes to an end, I almost feel like I'm losing some of my best ""friends""."
The Office,1,"As finales go, The Office's conclusion hit the mark."
The Office,1,...acceptable but not exceptional.
The Office,1,"I laughed, I cried, I kvelled, I nodded along, I ignored doubts, I admired zingers, I marvelled at the restrained use of flashbacks."
The Office,1,"There's a confident snap to the proceedings here that's been missed, and I appreciate his willingness to go dark."
The Office,1,"So this is it, the end. The Office is finally over, and while it still stings, I'm left satisfied and happy with no lingering questions or doubts"
The Office,1,"All in all, it was a satisfying end to a series that had been unsatisfying for a good long while."
The Office,1,"The Office should be commended for being based on a foreign series and becoming so distinctly its own entity, even despite its later shortcomings."
The Office,1,"In the end, it worked."
The Office,1,"At its best The Office was far from ordinary and, even if its most-rewarding days were in the rear-view mirror, deserved to finish on top."
The Office,1,Good comedies make you laugh. Great ones also make you cry. The Office proved why it belongs in the latter camp with a series finale full of the poignancy you'd expect from a comedy that was never afraid to show its heart.
The Office,1,"It's the sort of American Dream job - and job security - many people stopped believing in eons ago. That's why we loved The Office and hated the office. It was meant to look real, but it was pure escapism all along."
The Office,1,Few things on TV are as heartening as signs of life in a show that seemed creatively dead. The Office is this year's surprise resurrectee.
The Office,1,"The long arc of this, its final season, has been the slow but sure destabilization of its sweetest and surest thing, the loving relationship between Jim and Pam Halpert."
The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week."
The Office,1,"The Office opened back up for business Thursday, and it looks like business is, once again, good."
The Office,1,"The writers of The Office know this is their chance to hit the reset button and deliver one last quality season before riding off into the sunset, and ""New Guys"" made it clear that that's exactly what they aim to do."
The Office,1,The Office will go down as one of the best comedies ever to grace our television screens.
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
The Office,1,"I have certain strong opinions about how the show should've ended sooner, but I'm excited to see where it goes with Daniels back at the helm."
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
The Office,0,"The Season 9 premiere, ""New Guys,"" is as uneven as most episodes have been for the last few years."
The Office,1,"Despite some nagging flaws and off-notes, ""New Guys"" delivered an enjoyable and confident season opener that helped define the path for the episodes to come."
The Office,1,"With the end of the series in sight, it now has a renewed sense of purpose - to go out strongly, and perhaps paying off on a number of long-running subplots."
The Office,1,"The arrival of the new guys forces Jim to realize he's trapped in the job he despised back when he was that young. I've been waiting for this character arc for years now, and the scenes were promising (if not incredibly funny)."
The Office,1,The results so far are very (very) funny.
Supernatural,1,"'Route 66' meets 'The X-Files' series which they pretty well stick the landing. 20 episode and final season with epic number of featurettes,"
Supernatural,1,Fans of Supernatural have practically grown up with the Winchester Brothers and have watched the actors age and mature over the last fifteen years.
Supernatural,1,The ultimate series comes to a close with an epic final season.
Supernatural,1,"If there is some small silver lining to be found in this soft and ambiguous landing, it allows the perfect opportunity for the fandom to do what it's always done: create a version of the story they prefer."
Supernatural,1,"Sam and Dean have matured and evolved along with the people watching them, and their separate journeys speak to the darkness hunkered down within each of us and our wider culture."
Supernatural,1,"The Supernatural series finale took its time, gracefully balancing reference and nostalgia with a hunt and endgame worthy of its legacy."
Supernatural,1,"In classic Supernatural form, it was funny, filled with love, and downright devastating."
Supernatural,1,"Supernatural's season fifteen premiere is an enjoyable, action-packed affair which doesn't exactly make it clear where things are going from here but still points to it being a fun, final ride for the Winchesters."
Supernatural,1,"This premiere episode feels like a mix of the old Supernatural and the new. These urban legends fit the aesthetic of the early seasons a lot better, but they're not entirely out of place."
Supernatural,1,"It's a great start to the final season. There are lots of questions and lots of work to do, but Sam and Dean can handle it -- like they always do."
Supernatural,1,"Supernatural starts out the final season in the best way it possibly can. Dean and Castiel one liners, an appreciation for its history, and new stakes to carry them through the final season."
Supernatural,1,I was already excited for this season and the big fight facing the Winchesters. It's not fair to throw amazing fan service and heart-warming quotes at me. My feelings just don't stand a chance this season.
Invincible,1,"Falling in love with this violent, funny and emotional superhero story is... inevitable!"
Invincible,1,Game of Thrones for the superhero genre.
Invincible,1,"I am sure they want to find The Boys-style success here with a somewhat similar concept, given that the series is their most prominent original by far, and they're certainly off to a good start."
Invincible,1,"This is a great opening, birthing a new superhero series primed for Amazon."
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is the current, leading guilty pleasure for any self-respecting comic book fan."
Invincible,1,"If you are from the The Boys, or The Umbrella Academy school of anti-hero shows, you will find yourself exponentially rewarded with the time invested."
Invincible,1,"Rather than relying solely on shock value, Invincible feels ""adult"" in the more minor considerations of its characters."
Invincible,1,"Rest assured, this is so much more than just another superhero cartoon. No, this is humor, mystery, drama, romance and science fiction, all rolled up into one absolutely addictive treat."
Invincible,1,This lurid animated series combines the levity of a classic coming-of-age comedy with the trend of increasingly gritty superhero dramas.
Invincible,1,"It may not have the spectacle of a grand, VFX-embellished live-action entertainer to show off, but this little show does manage to hold its own nonetheless."
Invincible,1,"With its fun '80s-inspired animation style and stellar voice cast, Invincible is worth checking out for superhero genre fans. That said, it offers very little that we haven't seen before."
Invincible,1,"It's a very smart show, even if it's a bit too soon to tell if its many characters and elements will come together satisfactorily. With incredible talent behind it, Invincible is off to a very strong start."
Invincible,1,"It's hard to see exactly what ""Invincible"" wants to say with its expectation-shattering ethos, but it's certainly earns your attention."
Invincible,1,"The old-school animation, married with deep character work and a thoughtful plot that sticks with you, make the series stand out proudly among the comic book crowd."
Invincible,1,Not even Smallville could combine YA drama and superhero DNA this well.
Invincible,1,If all of Kirkman's upcoming shows are like this - we can't wait.
Invincible,1,"Invincible captures all the heart, humor, and brutality fans expect from the comics while still being open to new audiences."
Invincible,1,Anyone who loves superheroes in any shape or form will want to add this series to their viewing list.
Invincible,1,"Invincible is not for sensitive stomachs and, happily, it doesn't want to be. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Invincible,1,The human dimension is the great difference between this series and any other product emanating from the world of superheroes. [Full Review in Spanish]
Invincible,1,"Invincible's first season was great fun, full of both drama and humour, and an impressive voice cast only adds to the show's quality. Recommended."
Invincible,1,One of the best superhero series out there. [Full Review in Spanish]
Invincible,1,"Invincible may not be the most original superhero story, but it's a damn good one - fun, compelling, and with a hell of a voice cast, it's worth your time."
Invincible,1,"Invincible takes all the superhero tropes out there and turns them on its head, with a Mystery drama that combines the anxiety of the teenage world with ultra-violence and a dark sense of humor."
Invincible,1,"The fights are exciting, the animation's top-notch, but that's just the icing on the cake. Deep down, it is great, grade-A, solid, relatable, interesting character storytelling."
Invincible,1,"Replete with a solid score and many sequences of character development, Invincible relishes action sequences and character interactions as much as it does explicit gore, all with a wicked sense of humor."
Invincible,1,I'm definitely inclined to keep watching. But the producers will have to work hard to ensure that the 40- to 45-minute episodes (the same length as an hourlong TV show with commercials) don't start to feel bloated.
Invincible,1,A dark superhero series with similar beats you've seen before if you love the genre. The main drawback is that some of the main characters are not interesting enough to hold your attention like they should.
Invincible,1,"With a great voice cast led by Oscar nominee Steven Yeun, this animated series does justice to Robert Kirkman's superhero comics."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is at turns exhilarating, fun, unsettling, creepy, and disturbing -- everything you want from an action-adventure story. Take a flyer on it."
Invincible,1,"From its slick animation to its excellent voice cast, it's a winner from top to bottom."
Invincible,1,"Superhero fans will probably enjoy the many hat tips to classic superheroes, and although the subversion of tropes may feel less surprising than they did back in the day, it'll still pack a punch for comic and superhero fans alike."
Invincible,1,"Much like Amazon's massive superhero hit The Boys, it incorporates the iconography and character archetypes of more popular properties to give viewers something that still feels familiar and inviting."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is not only bold, brash and broad in scope, but has the ability to draw pathos from its smallest moments."
Invincible,1,"What if Spider-Man came out today, and it was very violent? The result is a fun yet dark show about the cost of being a teenage superhero."
Invincible,1,"Despite the frequent spattering of blood, Invincible doesn't otherwise aim to be lurid for the sake of it. Instead, it's got a story with nuance and heart."
Invincible,1,"'Invincible' is ridiculously violent, but at the center of its superhero satire is a coming of age story surprisingly full of heart."
Invincible,1,Some of the series' devices now seem less fresh than they did in 2003... but the show combats this by devoting serious screen time to building out the dynamics between its characters in ways big and small.
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
Invincible,1,A big part of Invincible's charm is in the way it has little use for most of the traditional sources of drama in superhero storytelling.
Invincible,1,There's likely going to be at least some of part of Invincible that piques your interest. But it's too early to say whether the whole season will pull together into something greater than its many parts.
Invincible,1,It's well written and the animation style is retro-cool.
Invincible,1,"Three episodes in, Invincible's a competent (and very close) adaptation conveyed by competent animation. However, the strength of the voicework suggests the show can offer increasingly more interesting stories as the season goes on."
Invincible,0,"Once the initial face-punch of that first episode wears off, there's not enough powering (or superpowering) ""Invincible."""
Invincible,1,"Amazon's new animated series goes through familiar superhero motions, but its well-crafted and jaw-dropping twist will keep you engaged."
Invincible,1,"Assuming there's no major deviation, Invincible might be the most faithful from comic to TV adaptation ever."
Invincible,1,"This series has so much heart, but it balances that with brutal moments that fans will never forget."
Invincible,1,"Indeed, streaming is awash in such fare... That sense of familiarity doesn't necessarily undermine Invincible on its merits, but it does make the exercise unavoidably feel a bit been there, seen that."
Invincible,1,...it's nice to see at least one superhero property at least trying to capture the full spectrum of what makes us so annoyingly obsessed with them.
Invincible,1,"Invincible is okay. As a piece of early 2000s nostalgia, it's fun enough, but it's just too dated, too cliche, and almost a bit too earnest to stand out in an entertainment landscape already packed with superhero entertainment."
Invincible,1,"I was impressed with how well it represents the classic spirit of the genre while simultaneously exceeding expectations, accommodating modern sensibilities without sacrificing personality. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Invincible,1,"Edgy, fresh & thrilling, Invincible actually manages to stand out in the very crowded superhero space. Voice cast is particularly strong, great to see Steven Yeun as lead."
Invincible,1,"As an animated entry presented as seriously as necessary while maintaining a grand sense of humor, Invincible has plenty to offer and is just getting started."
Invincible,1,"What both anchors and keeps Invincible compelling is its cast, packed to the brim with talent. As Mark, Yeun conveys a perfect combination of teenage insecurity, determination and occasional arrogance."
Invincible,1,"This is everything I wanted The Boys series to be. An incisive, unblinking, shocking, and bloody look at the downside of superheroes and it has jokes too. I cannot wait to inhale the rest of the series"
Invincible,1,"The end result is bewildering, but also exhilarating, injecting energy into a simple power fantasy premise even as it carries the potential to alienate viewers looking for lighter fare."
Invincible,1,"Like a good superhero comic, Invincible understands the value of unexpected twists and cliffhangers. And, like any comic hoping to keep its audience, it knows the value of getting off to a strong start."
Invincible,1,"For now, we'll simply say that Invincible is one of the best new shows for genre fans and a worthy addition to the oversaturated superhero market."
Invincible,1,"One of the best things about Invincible, though, is its stellar voice performances. While a lot of major characters get a chance to shine in the first three episodes, Steven Yeun's turn as Mark Grayson is particularly noteworthy."
Invincible,1,"While the first three episodes made available for review don't quite sell the idea that Invincible has much new to bring to the genre, they will certainly speak to longstanding fans who've been waiting for this adaptation for years."
Invincible,1,I think Amazon has something great on their hands. [Full review in Spanish]
Invincible,1,"Quite a credible family dynamic is created for a cartoon, not to mention one with demon detectives and bickering blue bad guys."
Invincible,1,Invincible boasts one of the most impressive voice casts of any series in recent memory.
Invincible,1,"It's not an entirely new approach for this genre, but the familiarity of Invincible is forgivable in light of the confidence that both Kirkman and Yeun bring to the material. They're the reason to watch."
Invincible,1,"The more extreme content can feel like Invincible is trying too hard to seem older, just in a different way from its title character. Still, it's fun, and Yeun, Simmons, and Oh make for a strong central ensemble."
Invincible,1,"A faithful, epic, violent and wildly fun adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is brutally violent, darkly comedic, and is one of the greatest animated superhero shows to be released. From beginning to its final moments Episode 1 sets the bar."
Invincible,1,"There are still some good bones to its premise, and just enough subversiveness to let you ignore the fact this is a story you've seen a hundred times before."
Invincible,1,"These first episodes are a great primer for the series with good animation, good characters, and solid twists and turns."
Invincible,1,"This superhero show may play it a bit safer than The Boys, which won't help it stand out in the current landscape of superhero content, but for now, it works and should satisfy fans of the comic, even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel."
Invincible,1,"Invincible is a truly gigantic story encompassing a ton of characters and subplots, and with hope the show will be able to achieve that same sense of scope."
Invincible,1,Invincible has so much heart and meaning behind those punches that the show leaves an impact even when it isn't throwing blood and severed limbs in your face.
Invincible,1,Every single frame of this beautifully animated series is just down right stupendous...
Invincible,1,Totally worth checking out... especially if you want a different look at what it means to be a superhero and what can come of it.
Invincible,1,"Its characters aren't developed enough to fill the enormous gap between approach and appearance. However, its central mystery offers enough questions, and enough promise, to keep viewers watching."
Invincible,1,"While it might seem like the dark superhero trend is overdone, 'Invincible' is exciting, beautifully animated, and buoyed by a killer voice cast led by Steven Yeun."
Invincible,1,"Balls to the wall action combined with a stellar voice cast make Invincible a must-watch new animated series, even if comic book fans will find much of what plays out on screen to be somewhat familiar."
Invincible,1,"Five minutes into its first episode, you'd be forgiven for thinking Invincible is just another superhero story, but in fact, it might be the best one you see all year."
Invincible,1,Fans of the comics will be instantly hooked -- and those that know nothing about them? They will be hooked too!
Invincible,1,The animated series delights in the pleasure that superheroes must feel when wielding their powers.
Vikings,1,These episodes land with the fury of Thor's hammer.
Vikings,1,"The thrills take their time, but when they come, they come with a mighty rush."
Vikings,1,"Season 6 had an entire fanbase on its shoulders, and it delivers the final episodes with care, thought and precision."
Vikings,1,"Vikings has been nominated for a string of Emmy awards, in categories ranging from editing to special visual effects, but has yet to receive any. An absolute travesty."
Vikings,1,Alexander does an incredible job of portraying Bjorn's torment over his choices and his struggle in trying to make the right decision.
Vikings,1,"All told, a strong return for Vikings, blessedly absent of all the preposterous nonsense that made last season so unbearable. On the other hand, it was largely setup for a conflict that I think has already worn out its welcome."
Vikings,1,Vikings' first two Season 6 episodes introduced some wicked new wild cards while teasing future conflicts.
Vikings,1,"It remains to be seen whether Vikings can sustain a level of interest fans of the show have come to expect, but hopefully, this final season won't follow Lagertha's lead and disappear into obscurity."
Vikings,1,"We can never be certain about how well a series will nail the ending, but at least with ""Vikings,"" the fandom's faith can lean on a firmer foundation based in history and demonstrated skill as opposed to spectacle and whim"
Vikings,1,"What seems evident after the first two episodes of Vikings Season 6 is that the series is starting to wrap up organically, unlike that show with dragons that fizzled out in its final season."
Vikings,1,"Vikings' subplot game has been hit or miss throughout its run... Still, the prospect of Ubbe on a Floki quest, while Bjorn faces his first real adversity as king could have the makings of character-defining arcs."
Vikings,1,"Which, again, fun. But for a show struggling to recapture the sense of sweep and character it initially promised, Ivar's new pal is leading him, and us, down a well-trod path to the same bloodied ground."
Suits,0,It was about as middle of the road and predictable as to be expected from Suits.
Suits,1,"The writing remains quick and direct, which is essential in a show so dependent on lawyer talk."
Suits,1,"It's a smart way to end, bringing it all full circle and tugging on our heartstrings along the way, reminding us that this story was always about their friendship and their mentorship."
Suits,1,"Suits is running on fumes and should have really called it quits with Season 8. If anything, this final season already feels like it's around purely to get people to tune in to the Gina Torres-fronted spinoff, Pearson."
Suits,1,It's royally entertaining.
You,1,"Despite a few dull moments, the show remains pretty sharp."
You,1,"Nobody lives happily ever after, even with couples therapy, and the bad guy will get to play Prince Charming in another fucked up fairy tale next season."
You,1,"As trashy TV goes, You still reigns supreme as one of the more bingeable pieces of entertainment out there right now."
You,1,"[Joe is] an often despicable character, an unrepentant self-serving creep, and yet sharp writing and a great performance from Badgley make him one of the more entertaining characters on television."
You,1,"It delivers. If you're in for thrills, chills and kills, you're getting that this season."
You,1,"I would love to have [Joe] narrate my own life, if I didn't know what that level of attention from him would mean for me."
You,0,"The stakes with ""You"" always lie in Joe being a protagonist you root against. But by season three's end, we stopped enjoying the ride - all we want is for Joe to receive his comeuppance."
You,1,"You is one of those series that one would expect would have lost its momentum by the third season. However, instead of hitting its plateau this show only keeps getting better."
You,1,"I love the sardonic tone and bluntness of the storytelling. Love's recklessness does become a point of contention, though."
You,1,"Joe and Love, seemingly perfect for each other before, have become something so disgusting and revulsive that you can't look away from the disaster."
You,1,"The stakes are higher and so is the tension. Joe may be a family man now, but he's still the guy who builds cages. And the rest of the excitement of this season is watching to find out if he ends up in one."
You,1,Season 3 Is the best installment yet-and a brilliant send-up of suburbia...
You,1,"In Season 3, You has room to unpack the full potential of that twist. The show is no longer about a single predator who fixates on women; it's about a couple of predators who have to balance their own impulses..."
You,1,"You remains a twisted guilty pleasure that will entertain its most fervent fans, but my own obsession with it is waning unless it shows me something more."
You,1,"The show's latest round of episodes may comprise its best outing yet. After a second season that lulled in the middle, You's third outing doesn't let up."
You,1,"You is a sly guilty pleasure as such things go. Joe's prolific and wry inner dialogue narrates and critiques the action, ensuring that we see him as weird, funny, appealing, carnal, sexy and menacing."
You,1,This was a really solid season... [Victoria Pedretti and Penn Badgley] playing opposite each other is really strong.
You,1,"Still a totally twisted delight, You somehow manages to take the stakes and performances to a whole new level in Season 3."
You,1,"What began as one-note thriller about a dangerous stalker became a savage spoof of internet-era relationships and, this season, a savage mockery of marriage and domestic bliss. It's crazy but so, so smart. Love it."
You,1,"YOU Season 3 elevates the series out of its pulpy beginnings and into more grounded drama. ... Fans of the show will enjoy the same potent blend of sensual heat and spine-tingling chills, but with a new and more anchored approach"
You,1,"As it does the impossible and wiggles out of its initial premise, You is becoming more self-aware - and it's all the better for it."
You,1,"Regardless of the conclusions it draws, ""You"" remains a fascinating look at just how hard it is to outwit and outrun your own nature."
You,1,The best thing about this season that makes it really work is that they actually expand the perspective outside of Joe's head.
You,1,"Honestly, I could watch these two attempt to out-gaslight, gatekeep, and girlboss each other to a pulpy soundtrack of Baby Queen and Taylor Swift for another 10 episodes."
You,1,"YOU Season 3 is the strongest season yet, and somehow, the premise is not derivative of itself."
You,1,"changing locations and adding Victoria Pedretti as co-star refreshed the series into a sexy, dynamic, fun season, full of twists and bloody surprises. [Full review in Spanish]"
You,1,It stays true to the expectations it has set in the previous seasons and moves at a delightfully breathless pace.
You,1,"If there is something You does correctly, it's the exploration of loss. To examine what it feels like as a person who previously experienced abuse, to witness abuse, again from a place without power."
You,1,You's third season is like watching a collision from the sidelines; you're unable to look away because you want to see who walks away.
You,1,"It promises the same two-faced neighborhood drama, hilarious delusions, literary references, and misplaced self-righteousness that got us hooked before but leaves plenty of room for uncertainty on how the plot unfurls."
You,1,"The season, ultimately, is a raging success, yet my goodness, there's a lot here."
You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms."
You,1,"You is gonna You, and it Yous spectacularly. Come for the glass box, stay to find out who goes in it, and watch it all go down in flames because you don't dare to look away."
You,1,"The season belongs to Badgley and Pedretti, who share formidable (and foreboding) chemistry."
You,1,"Season 3 does a fine job at showcasing the vapidness of a Silicon Valley-like suburb, where neighbors are mostly concerned with intermittent fasting, drugs and updating their Instagram stories on the hour every hour."
You,1,"A stalker drama can be fun, but it's got nothing on the murder-romp possibilities of a serial killer Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where no one trusts anyone else but also someone needs to finish up the murdering in time to take over child-care duties."
You,1,"Though it can be overstuffed at times, You balances brazen humor with emotional intelligence, all while keeping the mystery intact."
You,1,"Pedretti's performance is a delicious mix of rage and bougie suburban white lady privilege, a chaotic tour de force that's every bit as messy and reactionary as Badgley's Joe is removed and calculating."
You,1,"While it is always good fun to see Badgely deliver Joe's narcissism and delusional but witty outlook on romance, it has to be said that Pedretti really is the most valuable and interesting figure in the third run."
You,1,"You would be better served by not stopping to make excuses for Joe's behavior at this juncture, because it's actually at its best when it doesn't apologize for being a juicy, twisted thriller."
You,1,The change is scenery has stopped You from feeling stale. The pacing is quick and the twists rarely expected. The third season of this Netflix show continues to be a bingeable delight
You,1,"Stick with it, and you will be rewarded beyond your wildest, blood-soaked dreams."
You,1,"The result is schlocky, subversive fun, a series that, while certainly not for everyone, even if you're not already a fan, could become your new obsession, at least until the return of the real Dexter next month."
You,1,"This season Love actually out-crazies Joe, but grounds herself in their mutual common ground: self-pity. #diandrareviews"
You,1,Netflix's twisted romantic thriller is as intoxicating as ever with even more so-good-it's-scary work from Penn Badgley and Victoria Pedretti.
You,1,Spins familiar guilty pleasure yarn.
You,1,"As outlandish as the story gets this time around, the third season of You may be the most self-aware and entertaining yet. Viewers will be constantly breathing a sigh of relief, followed by the inevitable decision that keeps the series moving."
You,1,"Philosophical musings aside, You re-establishes itself as pure binge-able television, playing up the twists and cliffhangers that we've all come to expect."
You,1,"While Season 3 certainly doesn't disappoint, the disclaimer would be that this is one of those shows -- like spiritual daddy Dexter, which makes its own return next month -- where less might ultimately be more in contemplating the length of its run."
You,1,"This latest season of You does not disappoint. It brings back all the aspects of the show that fans love, adding new characters in a new setting, giving our toxic protagonists a new array of lives to infect."
You,1,"The writers have a great time skewering them all, and while some subjects they include may be easy targets (anti-vaxxers and dull married suburban life, for example), they are featured in often surprising - and deliciously dark - ways."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
You,1,"You season three still remains television worth the watch thanks to Penn Badgley's consistently pitch-perfect performance, and the show's signature mystery-driven twists and turns."
You,1,"You might be the most self-aware show on television, perpetually nimble in addressing its own narrative shortcomings."
You,1,"As secrets and bodies are buried this season, Joe and Love seem to be in love one minute and arch enemies the next. The most chilling season yet."
You,1,"You is, if nothing else, a cautionary tale about the perils of not keeping your social media channels set to private."
Bosch,1,"Bosch takes its place among the most understated, best tv series."
Bosch,1,"What remains the driving force is Harry Bosch's search for justice in behalf of himself and in behalf of those who cannot seek true justice for themselves, either because of their lack of power ... or because they are dead."
Bosch,1,"Season 7 of Bosch does fittingly close a chapter for the character, in both emotional terms and in thrillingly crossing some lines that cannot be uncrossed."
Bosch,1,"The impressive, understated acting by all the principals drives events with Titus Welliver as Bosch, the solid anchor with sophisticated taste, as impressive in still, silent moments as he is in action."
Bosch,1,This final season was blessedly void of that sense of headlong rush to the finish so many fan-favorites get when given the same chance to plan their swan song in advance.
Bosch,1,Fine farewell to a streaming jewel.
Bosch,1,An almost perfect season to cap off the run of an almost perfect series.
Bosch,1,"Come for the action and intrigue, but you'll want to stay for Bosch's cool vibe, from the classic jazz he spins on vinyl (naturally) to the iconic joints the characters frequent."
Better Things,1,"Over five seasons, it never failed to make me feel something, anything, during the course of an episode: mirth, empathy, embarrassment, sadness, introspection, catharsis, hope, a glass cage of emotion."
Better Things,1,"As befits the show’s general vibe, there is a deeply engrained sense of hope and happiness in the finale, which has a loose, casually profound plot."
Better Things,1,It will remind you why the world is worth saving and why life is worth living. It will chip away at your cynicism and help you move forward.
Better Things,1,"No show has better embodied the past few years of television, its indulgences and its innovations, the doors it opened and closed, its forgetting as well as its unearthly memory. And there may never be another show like it."
Better Things,1,"In its fifth and final season, the show bows out with grace, but not before using every trick in its impressive book to remind us to stop and let ourselves be spellbound once in a while."
Better Things,1,"The instinct right now is to either lean into the world’s horrors or distract with guilty pleasures. But Better Things is the catharsis we need, because we need to feel."
Better Things,1,An ideal culmination of everything that came before it...
Better Things,1,"If you haven’t watched before, now is the time."
Better Things,1,"In these years of unexpected and sorrowful goodbyes, the ability to delay ones that are within our control is a powerful impulse. Adlon pokes at that concept vigorously in her last 10 episodes."
Better Things,1,Better Things was a breath of fresh air when it premiered back in 2016 and has gone from strength to strength over four seasons... This much-awaited final season continues to deliver the goods.
Better Things,1,"For a series often cited as a tear factory, Better Things Season 5 is the straight-up funniest season to date, filled with boisterous montages, endearing quips, and the now-standard array of amiable character actors putting their best foot forward."
Better Things,1,I want to protect this woman I do not know who may not even need my protection. And I want to believe that the stories she puts on screen are both relatable and uniquely her own voice.
Better Things,1,"Better Things at its best, with Adlon offering one final refinement on how to see her world and ours — complete with laughter and almost guaranteed tears — before going off to the next step in her storytelling journey."
Better Things,1,"Its finally time to say goodbye, and what a sendoff it is."
Better Things,1,"In the main, I respected this show significantly more than I liked it for the first time. And yet respect it I did."
Better Things,1,"For six years and 52 episodes, Adlon's series has centered on the stories of everyday womenmoms, sisters, daughters, friendsand elevated the ephemera of their day-to-day lives into art."
Outlander,1,"... Dynamic, fresh, and always leaves us wanting more. [Full review in Spanish]"
Outlander,1,"As ""Outlander"" has progressed, its gradually expanded its universe and cast of characters, sometimes to the detriment of the story. Theres just so much going on at any given time. That doesnt change in Season 6, with mixed results."
Outlander,1,The season's beginning does struggle with pacing and flow as it sets up all the action and moving parts for the episodes ahead... but there should still be plenty left for Outlander fans to sink their teeth into this season.
Outlander,1,"... it's a welcome change of pace, even if this restful period for the Frasers and their loved ones will likely not last forever."
Outlander,1,"A few moments of thinking, ""okay, lets move this along"" seem like a fair trade when the result is otherwise so strong."
Outlander,1,"While I don't think we needed a supersized version showing how pain and suffering have permeated the ridge again, it was so wonderful to reconnect with the Fraser family again."
Outlander,1,"More Outlander is never a bad thing, especially with a shortened season. However, it does feel like this premiere’s generous run time hinders this episode’s final act."
Outlander,1,"Outlander gives us a gentle, suspenseful ""calm before the storm"" opener for Season 6, though to know the show is to know there's always a storm coming."
Outlander,0,When we return to Fraser’s Ridge things start out a little slow -- and not in the good “let’s just hang out with the family” kind of way.
The Wheel of Time,1,"While the Wheel of Time has much room for improvement, and sometimes devolves into CW level character drama, there's enough meat on this show's bones to be a promising start to this fantasy adventure."
The Wheel of Time,0,What frustrates me is from the outset of The Wheel of Time is that it does that thing where it spends five minutes quickly explaining a world you dont know with terminology you have never heard or really understand.
The Wheel of Time,0,"Wheel of Time is a frustrating series that is intermittently compelling, but much of the time is dead boring, with one of the most memorably unmemorable group of characters Ive seen in a long time."
The Wheel of Time,1,A great start to the long awaited adaptation. The scenery is beautiful while the characters are engaging and their quest memorable.
The Wheel of Time,0,"With a deficit of whimsy and wonder, ""Wheel"" introduces such thinly developed characters that it makes it hard to care (or see) who survives a chaotically filmed attack by monstrous orcs (sorry, trollocs)."
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
The Wheel of Time,0,You know what? I think the screen version might be even worse than the book.
The Wheel of Time,1,"Admittedly, The Wheel Of Time got off to a flawed, exposition-heavy start... But with a little more patience and investment, you will be rewarded with a much-needed escape."
The Wheel of Time,0,"From what I understand, longtime fans of the books have felt underwhelmed and badly served by some changes in characterizations, and the aging up of the main players."
The Wheel of Time,1,It's going to be exciting watching these characters grow.
The Wheel of Time,0,It all feels somewhat conventional. Is it the show's fault or because many fantasy film and television adaptations have already been made? [Full review in Spanish]
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
The Wheel of Time,1,This was a solid opener.
The Wheel of Time,1,This pilot needs to cover a lot... That the showrunners managed to do all this cohesively in 54 minutes is impressive.
The Wheel of Time,1,"While the adaptation isn't a carbon copy of the books, it works well as a complement."
The Wheel of Time,1,"In the world of fantasy literature, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time novels were once the biggest thing since The Lord of the Rings... This handsome and expensive-looking new television adaptation looks like doing them justice."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Open-minded viewers will find a great deal to dig here: romance, sword fights, monsters, magic."
The Wheel of Time,0,"You are... left with the uneasy, then sinking, feeling that ""Wheel"" - as sumptuous a production as this is - has been done before and better. A couple of times, at least."
The Wheel of Time,0,It's genuinely baffling how perfunctory the storytelling feels in The Wheel of Time.
The Wheel of Time,0,"The visuals have some magic here, but the overall journey fails to cast any sort of spell."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
The Wheel of Time,1,"For those who hang in there, rewards abound."
The Wheel of Time,1,Despite the flaws there's enough here that will keep viewers engrossed in the series with its expansive visuals and inherent intrigue over the mystery of the Dragon Reborn.
The Wheel of Time,0,"Shows like The Wheel of Time feel reverse-engineered from an ideal outcome. And, unlike in fantasies, prophecies in the real world aren't guaranteed to come true..."
The Wheel of Time,0,"There are worse fantasy series and films out there, to be sure, but none of them were dumb enough to give their monsters a name that rhymes with ""bollocks""."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Its fantastical elements, surprisingly hard-hitting violence, and committed performances keep this Wheel turning enough to earn satisfaction from genre-appreciative audiences."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Like any good fantasy epic, The Wheel of Time is one that promises very impressive returns, provided audiences are willing to settle in for the long haul."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The Wheel of Time is pretty and very watchable, but you need some patience to invest in the series once it hits the gas pedal midway in. It's worth the wait, though."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Does it do enough to distinguish itself in an already crowded genre? As yet, I'm not entirely convinced - however, the ambitious narrative is certainly intriguing."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The Wheel Of Time is off to a flawed beginning, but it's still fun and exciting and I care about the characters and hope they succeed against The Dark One."
The Wheel of Time,1,One thing The Wheel of Time excels at is world-building. It is magnificent.
The Wheel of Time,1,"The show has a lot going for it: rich source material, a cast who seem game for anything, well-choreographed fights, some of the most beautiful visuals in a television show this year, and a very promising start, if a little clumsy with the exposition."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Spectacular CGI, spectacular battles, spectacular towns shattering in their entirety, but spectacle is not storytelling. I've awarded three stars because, if this is what you like, I'm confident you will like this."
The Wheel of Time,1,"While the streaming service's adaptation of Robert Jordan's bestselling fantasy series isn't mind-blowing, its diverse cast, thoughtful script and often nuanced female portrayals make it yet another step in the right direction for the fantasy genre."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
The Wheel of Time,1,"It does manage to tell its story in a way that's compelling, unique and, frequently, surprising, full of narrative twists and character turns that even the most jaded fantasy reader might not see coming."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The result is a crisp, entertaining fantasy delight, one that -- if there is any justice -- may actually hand Amazon a genuine streaming hit."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Stick around for the marvellous cast of characters, both the sad and funny ones. As Moiraine, Pike is very stately and you get the feeling there is more to this woman than the speeches and her grave gaze on the world."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven."
The Wheel of Time,1,A perfect lockdown watch for those wishing to escape to another world.
The Wheel of Time,1,"There are a fair share of lingering questions that will frustrate fans but keep them engaged in the episodes to come. The world is vast, and this series is on its way to become one that everyone is talking about."
The Wheel of Time,1,It is a beautiful fantasy show and should not be compared to other fantasy shows like Game of Thrones because it's already its own entity.
The Wheel of Time,1,The overall result is an exciting adventure that gets better as it goes along.
The Wheel of Time,1,"This is not Game of Thrones, it's a warm hug of fantasy tropes, running gags and special effects. It will likely do very well, because those who adore it will watch it again and again."
The Wheel of Time,1,"It's absolutely fine. It's got brio, it's got style and it's got enough portentous voiceover book-ending events to make everything feel high stakes."
The Wheel of Time,1,"When it comes to adapting for the modern audience, sometimes changes need to be made, and that's a good thing."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The Wheel of Time is an enjoyable watch and a solid adaptation that should make fans of the books happy. For some, the show might struggle to stand out among other high-profile fantasy series."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Although there are many recognizable characteristics of fantasy storytelling weaved into 'The Wheel of Time', one of this show's more interesting features is the amount of diversity among its cast of characters"
The Wheel of Time,1,"However basic its beginnings, The Wheel of Time quickly reveals itself as an expansive world that demands return visits."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Wheel of Time is very self-serious, which makes it easy to mock, particularly if you're apt to make comparisons to other fantasy franchises: One screechy villain has Voldemort's nose; an Army of horned beasts are this show's version of Orcs."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It fulfills Jeff Bezos's alleged demand that Amazon develop its own ""Game of Thrones"" - in the most unspecial manner possible."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Early on, the wanderers take refuge in a cursed city, its deserted streets lined with baroque architecture and statuary. ""Wheel,"" as a production, feels like that. It's a breathtakingly detailed edifice with no people in it."
The Wheel of Time,1,It's a crowning achievement in every way.
The Wheel of Time,0,"While there is enough violence and faux-mysticism to keep genre fans happy, convincing human interactions are harder to find."
The Wheel of Time,1,"While the premise is completely intriguing, the delivery doesn't always work for those new to this world. Still, there is much potential for the rest of the season."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The Wheel of Time conjures up the sorcery, emotional twists, and trials by fire to satisfy your epic fantasy cravings"
The Wheel of Time,0,"As much as The Wheel of Time left me indifferent, I very much warmed to the universe of the Aes Sedais. Your introduction to them is Moiraine, and it's difficult not to be intrigued by her order. She's the type of woman who doesn't hear ""no"" often."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It's hard to get lost in this world when it feels so emotionally distant, so scattered, and so packed with thin plotlines."
The Wheel of Time,0,"I never felt like I was watching an unfolding story, but I absolutely felt like I was watching the whiteboard in a writers room, more the pushing of note cards toward a destination than an adventure."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Despite the weak characterization, I still found The Wheel of Time rather watchable."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The material is there, and the execution so far seems up to the task."
The Wheel of Time,1,"A slow start paves the way for a satisfyingly ambitious fantasy that fans of the genre can really get stuck into. For the uninitiated, though, it might all sound like a load of trollocs."
The Wheel of Time,1,"It's both better and worse than the books. And yet, for some reason, I'm ready for more."
The Wheel of Time,1,"As far as fantasy series go, The Wheel of Time delivers and then some."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Based on the six episodes available for review, The Wheel of Time doesn't seem inherently unfilmable. It simply could have been filmed better."
The Wheel of Time,0,Will The Wheel of Time be a hit? Don't ask me. All I know is that I went into a kind of death spiral after watching the first episode.
The Wheel of Time,1,"There's more to explore if you want it, but for casual viewers, much of the ancillary information is either doled out when it's important to know, or is glossed over because it would otherwise bog things down."
The Wheel of Time,1,"The Wheel of Time is gorgeous, well acted, and strongly written, a show that understands the characters and plot of Robert Jordan's books without being slavishly loyal to the source material."
The Wheel of Time,0,"This premise would, on its face, seem to lend itself well to episodic drama. And yet the series, created by Rafe Judkins, finds itself stranded on various morasses."
The Wheel of Time,0,"[It] may bring in some fantasy fans starved for any morsel of magic and wonder. But the whole thing is empty, if expensive, calories."
The Wheel of Time,1,"All told, The Wheel of Time has way more to woo book readers than repel them."
The Wheel of Time,1,The Wheel of Time is a very strong start to a much-awaited series and created by someone who has a clear understanding of how adaptations can soar when complementing their source material rather than just copying it.
The Wheel of Time,1,"When The Wheel of Time does fire on all cylinders, it's proof that it might actually be possible to fit the book into a coherent TV show."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Drawbacks aside, I must say, ""The Wheel of Time"" isn't bad."
The Wheel of Time,0,The Wheel of Time ends up as a disservice to Robert Jordan's books. What could have been a Dune-level masterpiece ends up a middle-of-the-road offering that fails to live up to its potential.
The Wheel of Time,1,It's simply a thrill to see these cherished characters finally get an adaptation worthy of such a grand adventure.
The Wheel of Time,1,"In its early episodes this big Wheel has enough sweep, mystique and momentum to suggest that it can keep on turning and give Amazon the global hit it dearly craves."
The Wheel of Time,1,"Wheel seems able to satisfy new viewers and superfans alike, creating an inviting and rich world that isn't too confusing to understand."
This Is Us,1,"A conclusion to This Is Us was a big responsibility, but writer Dan Fogelman delivered something that was perfect in its simplicity."
This Is Us,1,"After six seasons, multiple timelines, and countless gray wigs, NBC’s sobfest comes to end with an episode that absolutely sticks the landing."
This Is Us,1,"There are no perfect games in series finales either. But in terms of reflecting what the show had been all about over the course of its tear-filled run, ""This is Us"" came pretty close to touching all the bases."
This Is Us,1,"The Pearson family deals with inevitable divorce and death, but the show’s final episodes bring the big picture of their lives fully into view, with some truly meaningful long-form storytelling."
This Is Us,1,"There’s nothing wrong with This Is Us as a respite from all of this mayhem. This week’s Thanksgiving episode is one of the best. And no fires to put out, except for the emotional ones."
This Is Us,1,"Think of it as the family dynamic you loved in Parenthood, meets the emotionally crippling storylines of Grey’s Anatomy. Soppy drama at it’s very best."
This Is Us,1,This Is Us has always had lowercase-c conservative values... This is what is both endearing and limiting about This Is Us.
This Is Us,1,"Toeing the line between sincerity and saccharine, it was an episode of This Is Us that delivered what the show does best-setting the stage for its final string of twists and meeting its one-tissue-per-episode minimum."
This Is Us,1,"In the Peak TV era, This Is Us effectively carried a torch for a more traditional kind of television that still retains its allure."
This Is Us,1,"The series, at its heart, is about how people and families change over time, including how beloved characters grow old and die."
Lucifer,1,"A show that started as a procedural with a little bit of the supernatural thrown in turned into a wonderful story about the importance of personal growth, the way love can change and shape a person, and the power of our own decisions."
Lucifer,1,"If you bear with that lackluster beginning, however, you'll find that Lucifer still has a few solid twists up its fine silk sleeves."
Lucifer,1,Many shows out there entertain. Not very many shows actually stick the landing of the wrap-up.
Lucifer,1,"Lucifer's final sendoff is at best satisfactory, elevated by the performances of its cast and the finesse of its production..."
Lucifer,1,"If the first two episodes are any indication, this looks set to be a marked improvement on the truly woeful season 5B, but alas, Netflix's fantasy drama remains a long way from heavenly."
Lucifer,1,"""Partners 'Til the End"" provides a marvelous ending to a series of stories that will continue. Unfortunately, we won't be there to witness these sublime delights. All good things must come to an end."
Lucifer,1,"Though it was touch-and-go there for a couple seasons as we wondered how Lucifer would end, the show managed to give us exactly the kind of sendoff we-and these characters-deserved."
Lucifer,1,"For five seasons, we watched Lucifer work on himself in therapy. Season 6 finally lets him use everything he's learned to reach his destiny."
Lucifer,1,"Lucifer turned out to be a much better show than it ever needed to be, and the final season is a downright pleasure to witness."
Lucifer,1,Tom Ellis and co give a sweet and sentimental goodbye to the Devil-done-good in Lucifer's final season. It's sure to leave fans more than happy.
Lucifer,1,"All in all, this is a bit of a mess of a final season, and it's hard to decide if it is a mess that works to the series' benefit or if it's a detriment to the absolute highs that Season 6 hits. Because when Season 6 is good, it is absolutely fantastic."
Lucifer,1,"We love these characters for various reasons, and those reasons are on full display here. This final season will leave longtime fans satisfied."
Lucifer,1,"Over the years, it's gotten looser, funnier, more sure of itself and more emotionally engaging, all while showing admirable fealty to the building blocks of quality mainstream television."
Lucifer,1,"Sure to ruffle some angel wings. Ultimately, however, it gives closure to its characters in a way that should be mostly heartwarming to its fanbase."
Counterpart,1,A strong start. [Full Review in Spanish]
Counterpart,1,"I'd argue that 'Counterpart' is one of the best shows of all time, moving up there with Bryan Fuller's Hannibal and David Simon's The Wire."
Counterpart,1,The acting - especially that of JK Simmons' two versions of Howard Silk - is once again outstanding.
Counterpart,1,[Nazanin] Boniadi's acting capabilities have been put on display in a way that should have heads turning and people talking in a big way... Counterpart is creating some of the most interesting and intriguing roles for women.
Counterpart,1,"The story that ""Twin Cities"" tells is one that someone who's never seen a single episode of Counterpart could appreciate."
Counterpart,1,"God, I love this show."
Counterpart,1,"Beyond its artfully chilly atmosphere and its surprisingly plausible and suspenseful narrative, the main attraction in Season 2 remains J.K. Simmons's crafty, quiet portrayal of the two spies."
Counterpart,1,"Continues to be like a cocktail made up of equal parts John le Carré and Philip K Dick, then shaken not stirred by JJ Abrams."
Counterpart,1,Counterpart Season 2 gives Williams the same opportunity to explore the Emilys in great detail.
Counterpart,1,"""Counterpart"" is finely woven to the point where missing key beats can throw the whole thing off for you. It's a riveting mind game, expertly pulled off."
Counterpart,1,"Fans of this byzantine sci-fi/spy thriller who muddled through its elaborate, twisty first season won't be disappointed."
Counterpart,1,"Overall, the most remarkable thing about Counterpart season 2 is that it has the confidence to make storytelling decisions and direct its narrative like a series entering its fourth or fifth season."
Counterpart,1,"Counterpart has grown beyond its premise and is still one of the best shows on television, even if we don't get the Howards in the same room together."
Counterpart,1,The table is set for a faster-paced but significantly deeper conspiracy tale in this season of Counterpart.
Counterpart,1,"Counterpart is a deftly orchestrated spy thriller and that hasn't changed a bit so far. But the question of why we're watching it does need to be answered, and that's where ""Inside Out"" falls short."
Counterpart,1,"Every now and then, Simmons will be back onscreen... and Counterpart will spark back to life again. But far too often, it feels like a star vehicle determined to prove it's anything but -- and squandering its most valuable resource as a result."
Counterpart,1,"Starz's excellent, mind-boggling spy series again explores how our choices shape us, and is a tour de force for its fantastic cast -- almost all of whom now play duel roles."
Counterpart,1,"An exacting performance by Simmons, again, goes a long way toward illustrating just how crucial clarity can be in the growing, changing realm of science fiction."
Counterpart,1,"I wish I could watch a Prime-world version of Counterpart. But we do not have two worlds, so instead I will keep watching the version of Counterpart we do have, and enjoy it for the good things it offers, like Simmons's performance."
Counterpart,1,"While they ably continue the story and Simmons, Williams and company continue to do excellent work, those early episodes don't leap off the small screen like they did last year... That said, all episodes are strong."
Counterpart,1,"This time around, Counterpart is playing hard and fast. It works tirelessly to make every episode move at a breakneck pace while still feeling like the same slow burn show it was in the previous season."
Counterpart,1,Watching Simmons move seamlessly between two versions of a character with diametrically different personality types is a wonder.
Undone,1,"Deeply rich and resonant, as intelligent and affecting as sci-fi and animation alike get, and dedicated to thinking and feeling big while confronting everyday truths, Undone is like nothing else that's streaming."
Undone,1,"This moving, beautifully animated drama explores grief, regret, acceptance and abandonment with haunting intensity."
Undone,1,"With BoJack Horseman and now Undone, Bob-Waksberg and Purdy have really mastered the art of cathartic TV."
Undone,1,"In the end, Undone is still good TV, even if it’s no longer mind-blowing."
Undone,1,"Undone brings nuance and humor to modern characters with Anglo and Latin roots without ever questioning their authenticity in either space. It’s a powerful break from the narrative of difference and less-than we normally see, and I’m grateful for it."
Undone,1,Undone is definitely its own strange concoction. Season two felt a lot more like an emotional drama (with some soap opera elements) than season one's trippy sci-fi mystery. But it still has all of that weirdness...
Undone,1,"Brian Swanson and Hisko Hulsing execute one of the consistent and deliberately paced episodic Seasons in recent memory. Achieving deep wells of emotion, without steeping itself in halfhearted cliff hangers. Everything points toward the finale."
Undone,1,Undone‘s second season is a masterstroke of sci-fi brilliance...
Undone,1,Big ideas here. Profound at times. But they’re encased in an oddly buoyant and funny context that also manages to be substantial and emotionally resonant.
Undone,1,"The rotoscoped animation is breathtaking, and every performance is phenomenal. Not only that, Undone Season 2 tells a complex story of latinidad, mental health, disability, trauma, and how our lives affect and are affected by those around us."
Undone,1,"Unlike the first season of Undone, the second is a family affair -- and for the better."
Undone,0,Nuanced dilemmas quickly fade into the background as the series adopts a more straightforward format in its second season.
Undone,1,"Still an emotionally affecting and visually stunning series, unlike anything else on TV."
Undone,1,"All said, similar to Undone season one, this eight-part series -- which is more like an extension of the unfinished story -- is a trippy adventurous ride that you won't mind jumping on."
Undone,1,"There’s no sense trying to explain Undone. It’s a hallucinogenic family dramedy that’s made to be seen and experienced, an ouroboros devouring its own tail—and enjoying every bite."
Undone,1,"Just when it felt like Undone could not top its first season, its second has it firing on all cylinders."
Undone,1,"Undone is like no other show on television; broadcast, cable, or streaming. Its funny, touching, and brimming with vitality."
Undone,1,"The episodes, all less than 30 minutes, fly by, becoming more compelling as they proceed, sprouting new roots and encompassing even more family history that expands further and deeper."
Undone,1,It’s a masterful way to reexamine all the most potent ideas without the show feeling like it’s repeating itself.
Undone,1,"'Undone' uses the infinite nature of the multiverse to get to the bottom of character deficiencies and compounded generational trauma, just like light refracted through a raindrop, to produce a special season of television."
The 100,1,"This season has a lot to live up to, and saying farewell is notoriously difficult. But if this episode (and the three others critics could view) are any indication, we're in excellent hands."
The 100,1,"Listen, I am here for this futuristic alien vibe that's going on with the anomaly. It's weird, and I think we deserve a break from the us vs. them / ""are we good? are we bad?"" themes that this show has overdone a bit by now."
The 100,1,"While we've only seen four of the final season's extended sixteen-episode run, it's evident that challenge is more relevant than ever to the themes of the story The 100 wants to tell"
The 100,1,"Season seven seems to additionally have the capacity to recycle a considerable amount of the same threads and concepts from past seasons, while seemingly not proving that they can tie them together to make a cathartic ending."
The 100,1,"The 100's new season hits the ground running -- literally -- barely giving its characters and, by extension, its audience, the chance to breathe as the stakes are raised once again."
The 100,1,This is a pleasant start to the final season and there's a lot of emotional resonance to be explored.
The 100,1,"Eliza Taylor's acting is a highlight of ""From the Ashes,"" with her putting anger and emotion into Clarke's speech to the people of Sanctum."
The 100,1,"There's a new set of mysteries and stakes this season that will keep fans on the edge of their seats, and which will end, fittingly, on a full one hundred episodes."
Atlanta,1,"This is a full-bodied, savage attack on white pretensions: the mealy mouthed, insincere ""allies"" who use black pain simply to further themselves."
Atlanta,1,"There’s something unabashedly insidious about Atlanta... beloved by the exact breed of hipster white liberal that it often seems to hold in the highest contempt. I suppose that’s just because it’s brilliant, though, and like absolutely nothing else."
Atlanta,1,"It’s nice to see that even in the pursuit of television immortality, Glover hasn’t lost sight of the value of a solid gag."
Atlanta,1,"Just when you think you’re watching a whimsical stoner-comedy, it grabs you like a dead hand reaching up from a haunted lake, and reminds you of the absurdist horror lurking beneath."
Atlanta,1,"It’s a bold move to start the new season of your Emmy award-winning drama without any of the main characters, but Donald and Stephen Glover are into making art not chasing ratings."
Atlanta,1,"Atlanta still boasts the best core quartet currently on television. It's still the best among at almost everything it does, in fact, including sliding onto Glover's always busy resume."
Atlanta,1,The latest season of Donald Glover’s series is a sardonic exploration of Black commercial success as oppression.
Atlanta,1,"Season 3 has found the show’s core cast enjoying more success than ever. As the installment’s unorthodox storytelling exemplifies, fame makes the Black experience that much more confounding."
Atlanta,1,Never explicit or obvious... [Full review in Spanish]
Atlanta,1,"Atlanta’s glorious weirdness, its dive into the surreal, is what makes the show nimble and wonderfully written. It covers a wide spectrum of Blackness, all while being relatable."
Atlanta,1,"Although it isn't set in Atlanta (Amsterdam gets the honors), this season is very Atlanta. Keenly insightful, brutally honest and often painfully accurate."
Atlanta,1,"It would take a potent, sinister spell for Atlanta not to return as itself. In this season, even when the series aims for discomfort, a blatant disregard to be defined except on its own terms makes for a knowing calm."
Atlanta,1,"This oddball series never lets up in excitement or eccentricities. Even as Atlanta expands its range to Europe, its good to be back in the Hollywood of the South."
Atlanta,1,"Despite the tonal shifts and wild swings, Atlanta is still confident that viewers will come along for the ride, even after so many years away. Perhaps it’s a good bet..."
Atlanta,1,"It’s sinister, it’s absurd, and it’s funny, and the reality of Atlanta contorts to underline that"
Atlanta,1,"For the third and penultimate season of Atlanta, everyone returns to characters they know well for a brilliant season that upends expectations beyond what we already have come to associate with this series."
Atlanta,1,"“Atlanta” proves you can take a break, see most of your cast break out into wider stardom, and still return strong as ever."
Atlanta,1,Put your phone down for a second and look out the window. You’re going to get there soon enough. It’s just that there’s some stuff the show would like you to notice on the way first.
Atlanta,1,"Good TV shows are consistent, but the great ones know how to change and grow with their characters and with the times. Atlanta has always been one of the greats."
Atlanta,1,"Many shows try to break rules, but few do so as gracefully as Atlanta."
Atlanta,1,"It may have taken four years for Atlanta to come back, but it’s lost none of its daring in the interim."
Atlanta,1,What Atlanta captures is being Black in America is to be cast in an ongoing horror comedy — the only genre that can make sense of the experience.
Atlanta,1,It feels like we’ve lived seven lifetimes since this show last aired. It’s finally back.
Atlanta,1,TV's greatest surrealist comedy.
Atlanta,1,"In many ways, Atlanta is creating its own folklore. Like the city after which it was named, it has a curious allure that’s hard to define, but captivating nevertheless."
Atlanta,1,"Far from a whimsical travelogue, this season of Atlanta promises to sustain an off-kilter vibe that rattles your nerves."
Atlanta,1,"Hip-hop is a passion, but on ‘Atlanta’ and in Atlanta, it’s also a job. Donald Glover’s series makes sure to never forget that."
Atlanta,1,The opening episodes of the FX hit’s third season quite literally take the show to new places. Yet they also show how ‘Atlanta’ is now mature enough to start revisiting familiar themes.
Atlanta,1,"The Donald Glover-created series, returning for Season 3, remains as ethereal and shocking and fascinating as ever; having screened the first two installments, its a thrill to know that eight more are coming to engage and confound us."
Atlanta,1,"Atlanta has always been great, but with these first two episodes of Season 3, it continues its path of becoming one of the all-time greats."
Atlanta,1,Atlanta is undeniably great television that delivers what fans have come to love about the series while still pushing the boundaries of what the show can be.
Atlanta,1,"Atlanta remains one of TV's most distinctive shows, if not the most distinctive, artistically ambitious show of its era. It's hilarious, disturbing, sad, and silly all at once, and is unafraid to challenge its audience."
Black Mirror,0,"With its move to Netflix, Black Mirror transformed from observing and satirising digital culture to becoming an active tool in some of its worst contemporary excesses."
Black Mirror,1,There was little novelty that we have come to expect from this show. Let's hope Charlie Brooker's devilish mind has something more impressive for the show's future.
Black Mirror,1,The present day-with-a-twist anthology series works best when it avoids easy moralising and keeps us in a spin.
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
Black Mirror,1,"Season 5 of Black Mirror is a more calm, focused look at the human stories of technological advancement and a thoughtful examination of our own complex relationships with each other."
Black Mirror,1,"The concepts are simple, and yet showrunners Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones find evermore potent ways to drive down into humanity's darker instincts."
Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror's fifth season rang in a new era of confidence and dedication to exploring the world of genre when it comes to creating impactful pieces.
Black Mirror,1,An anthology of this calibre can be forgiven its weaker moments and this season does enough to leave you wanting more.
Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.
Black Mirror,1,"Overall, this season offers relatively lighter fare for what can typically be an extremely heady, dark watch. And outside of a few pieces of tech, these stories could very much play out in the real world today."
Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror still feels right - precisely because it feels so wrong.
Black Mirror,1,It may not be on the level of classic Black Mirror... but it's still a fine place to look for digital-era self-reflection. Just don't expect this run of episodes to break your brain.
Black Mirror,1,"Even with only three new episodes to watch, season 5 of Black Mirror delivers. All three episodes are worth watching - some more than once!"
Black Mirror,1,The kind of anthology show that proved the possibilities of television 60 years ago... No one does the year 2025 like Black Mirror.
Black Mirror,1,"This season of Black Mirror is softer than previous entries, but this change of pace isn't wholly unwelcome. It's nice to see that Brooker isn't obsessed with making his content 'edgy for edges' sake."
Black Mirror,1,"Taken together, an utter treat, although real life is surely moving faster than even Black Mirror's vaulting imagination can keep pace with."
Black Mirror,1,"Anything that's tech and dystopian is now ""a bit Black Mirror"", but the latest three episodes remind you how it's the human moments that set the series apart from mere tech horrors."
Black Mirror,1,"For a show that's built its brand on nihilistic spirals, there's something heartening in watching Black Mirror embrace the audacity of hope."
Black Mirror,0,"The three episodes combine, however, to make for a slight and overly long viewing experience."
Black Mirror,1,"A shorter season of ""Black Mirror"" brings this show back to its roots in how it feels more immediate and plausible... these more contained fables have the eerie effect working like a true mirror to how we live and feel today."
Black Mirror,0,'Black Mirror' has lost its spark as season five leans on findings of the past. [Full Review in Spanish]
Black Mirror,1,"Cyrus' casting packs ""Ashley Too"" with heaps of spoken and unspoken observations about the kind of environment that would create someone like her."
Black Mirror,0,"Season five is a mess, and nothing about it suggests that Black Mirror retains its original, unnerving insight into the ever-blurring borders between the digital and the human."
Black Mirror,1,"Black Mirror's fifth season is one of the series' best, with a condensed batch of new stories that deliver great storytelling, interesting characters, and fascinating technologies that don't overshadow Charlie Brooker's deeply personal stories."
Black Mirror,1,"The new trio of stories still pack a punch, with Brooker putting social media giants and the music industry in his satirical crosshairs."
Black Mirror,0,"Brooker still has the teeth - and the imagination to craft tales that link into our techno-paranoia, showing us a world gone wrong where we are not too careful - but the bite is somewhat lacking."
Black Mirror,1,"If Black Mirror has moved from telling future stories to telling right-now stories, it might need to readjust."
Black Mirror,0,Compared to the deep imaginative voyages of previous series... the new season feels woefully underpowered.
Black Mirror,1,Black Mirror's 'be careful what you wish for' take on technology is as wired as ever.
Black Mirror,1,"Watching Black Mirror's three brand-new installments on Netflix makes it clear that the series, in our current TV universe, claims and holds the fantasy anthology series crown."
Black Mirror,0,"Such dissonance underscores the impression, supported by the occasional but conspicuous Britishisms that issue from the mouths of American characters in the Netflix seasons, that Brooker isn't getting enough feedback on his scripts."
Black Mirror,1,"These episodes are lighter than you might expect from Black Mirror. There's no pitch-black Crocodile in amongst this batch, and one of them is positively a romp, but that's not to say that the themes aren't heavy."
Black Mirror,1,"Series five, newly out on Netflix, consists of only three episodes but each is richly suggestive, cunningly plotted and captivatingly played."
Black Mirror,0,"It's weird to feel so poorly about three arguably good episodes of television, but the short length of Season 5 only serves to highlight the deficiencies of the season as a whole."
Black Mirror,1,"Any anthology is going to yield somewhat uneven results, but Brooker's hitting percentage has been pretty envious. By that measure, a homerun, a single and a pop up isn't bad, but ""Striking Vipers"" is the one that really draws blood."
Black Mirror,1,"The three instalments vary in mood, genre and just about everything else (as anthologies are designed to do) but they share a new air of calm authority."
Black Mirror,1,"As the world around us becomes more and more unstable, Black Mirror now finds itself in a precarious position. How can your dystopian sci-fi show compete with the actual impending actual dystopia?"
Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him."
Black Mirror,1,"It's slower, more methodical, and not at all what you're expecting. But there's a reason for just about every tonal choice, and it helps to deliver a brilliantly written and emotion-driven journey."
Black Mirror,1,"Season 5 can't help but feel like a placeholder, something created only to fulfil certain contractual obligations, or perhaps to buy Charlie Brooker more time to create the next Bandersnatch."
Black Mirror,1,The new season recalls the most human elements of past episodes while levying urgent indictments of the present.
Fargo,1,"More of the (very good) same, then."
Fargo,1,"The first half of this opening episode was just tremendous, although I did feel the second drifted a bit."
Fargo,1,"Given that Fargo has always stood out, it is strange that it seems to be settling for blending in."
Fargo,1,"Fargo has returned still smarter and slicker than the majority of crime dramas out there. But for those who've seen the series reinvent itself to great success twice already, this may feel like one do-over too many."
Fargo,1,Where does Ethelrida figure in to a gang war between adults? This reporter is eager to find out.
Fargo,1,Fargo Season 4 is good and sometimes it is really good and comes close to the lofty goals that the series obviously has.
Fargo,1,"By the end of this leisurely-paced opener, they had yet to cohere into something of substance."
Fargo,1,"Generally, the show's greatest successes occur whenever any given pairing is allowed to simply interact, especially its foes, such as Odis with Deafy or Oraetta and Ethelrida."
Fargo,1,"Playing the game only gets Black people so far, and others near society's bottom rung enjoy feeling superior to them. The season isn't a failure, but the swing Fargo took would have connected if it utilized a better way of communicating this."
Fargo,1,Fargo's fourth saga [is] both timely and a satisfying view of the American dream as a flawed fable.
Fargo,1,"There's no show like it on TV, and no better time than now to catch up."
Fargo,1,"Fargo wouldn't be Fargo without snow, a lot of blood dripping on the snow, and very bad baddies beaten... But, on top of that, this season has become almost Lorca. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Fargo,1,"With beautiful transitions and some of the best camerawork the series has ever shown, Fargo continues to be a series that redefines not only itself but what makes television great."
Fargo,0,"While Hawley's effort is admirable, and the performances from the cast keep the show at least watchable, most of what happens throughout the season, unfortunately, feels monotone."
Fargo,1,"Thanks to solid writing and a fantastic cast, all of the major characters are well defined and have a presence that helps the audience feel invested right away."
Fargo,1,"It is ambitious, slick, and ponderous, carefully lining up dominoes for a spectacular collapse, but never illuminating anything a student of the gangster epics doesn't already know."
Fargo,1,"Fargo is Fargo; you'll get excellent and unexpected performances, a lot of quirk, a lot of violence, and a lot of fascinating side stories."
Fargo,1,"As this show continues to deliver strong anthology seasons, it is refreshing to see it tackle new approaches to familiar topics."
Fargo,1,Chris Rock has finally found a dramatic role worthy of his considerable talents.
Fargo,1,"Buckley's daft performance is the star turn of a very talented cast. Evaluating the rest of the show, however, is more difficult, particularly its attempt to establish a moral footing for itself."
Fargo,1,"Back for its fourth season, the important good news is this iteration of Fargo is significantly better than the disappointing third season, though probably not as good as the near-perfect second season."
Fargo,1,"It may not be the show's most exciting season, but in the longer term, it may be the most important."
Fargo,1,"Series creator Noah Hawley has come up with yet another ambitious, dazzling, and entertaining season of his Coen brothers-based anthology series, this time with a story that brings in themes of racism, assimilation, and the fraught promise of America."
Fargo,1,"Incredibly ambitious, at times outrageously inventive and breathtaking, Noah Hawley's Coen Brothers-inspired anthology series is back with a bang."
Fargo,1,"It's the most epic-scaled season of Fargo yet, and while it has sprawling-story problems, it's always riveting."
Fargo,1,"Buckley has marked herself out as one of the leading lights of her generation. On the evidence so far, this is her finest performance yet."
Fargo,1,"Is it bad? Not exactly. But it is kind of dull, and what's striking is how tentatively the new season seems to be willing to engage in those few elements of its setting that are unique."
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
Fargo,1,"Season 4 is a sharp enough break to restore faith in Fargo as a concept. Whatever else it may be, this new story isn't inert. And after such a moribund Season 3, it's strong evidence the well hasn't run dry just yet."
Fargo,0,"The characters tend to be as thin as the story they inhabit, though, and vivid performers like Buckley and Esposito (of the Italian gangster series ""Gomorrah"") can't do much with the cartoons they've been given to play."
Fargo,1,"Like this nation, the new season is a beautiful and ugly, inspiring and infuriating, a tragic and sometimes darkly hilarious mess. As frustrating as it often was to watch, I couldn't look away."
Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness."
Fargo,1,"Hawley has more than proved that he's a worthy foe of tropes and cliches, but here, his vision can at times feel detrimentally self-indulgent... What does work here, at times terrifically, is the complete shift in setting."
Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated."
Fargo,1,"Fargo, as in past seasons, manages to be both more dramatic, and more comic, than almost any other show on TV right now."
Fargo,1,"The series' fourth season is both a welcome return to form and a compelling, cinematic vision of the so-called American dream gone to rot."
Fargo,1,"Chris Rock brings the pain - and the menace - in an ambitious, mobbed-up period piece..."
Fargo,0,"Too often, though, the narrative moves at a crawl, filled with long conversations that carry the impending threat of violence."
Fargo,1,"This series retains its wonky history, often philosophical humour, outstanding characters and exploration into the wonders of human behaviour."
Fargo,1,"Rock dives into the material and adds emotional gravitas. His charisma as a performer creates comedic elements with ease, but he never loses sight of the stakes."
Fargo,1,"If you've stuck with ""Fargo"" this long and over the years haven't been turned away by the freewheeling nature of its story or the quirky characters which inhabit the narrative, than season 4 will prove just as rewarding."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven."
Fargo,1,"You practically need a map, the series is so all over the place. But frustrations and all, it's a journey worth taking."
Fargo,1,. It feels like Hawley is going less for the quirky black humor of the first three seasons and more for the tone of what was seen in the Coen's early serious films.
Fargo,1,"Clearly Hawley needed to get out of Minnesota to recharge his batteries, but maybe it's time to leave the Coen sandbox for good."
Fargo,1,"The Coen Brothers make movies about quirky characters, but it would be nice if Noah Hawley and the team behind the Fargo TV series would remember that there's more to those movies than the quirk."
Fargo,1,"The sprawling set of characters gives the story an appropriate epic scope, which is a new approach for the series, and makes this season feel fresh, even if it's operating in a well-established genre."
Fargo,1,"Even when it isn't peak Fargo and despite being weighted down by ambitions that aren't fully realized thus far, there are sweeping swathes of greatness here."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has lost its footing in Season 4, succumbing to stylization and caricature and gratuitous over-plotting, and effectively wasting a tremendous cast. We're left with a weak story and a few banal monologues about race, money, and Life In America."
Fargo,1,"Like America itself, Fargo is a dizzying, delightful swirl of influences. And this move away from the series' familiar Minnesota home turf is mostly a rollicking success."
Fargo,1,A season of television that struggles to feel cohesive but does deliver some stand-out moments and fantastic characters.
Fargo,1,"Fargo has always been good, from the very beginning, against odds so long you could wrap them around the earth like a lasso. None of that changes here. I can't wait to see how the rest of this rumpus hashes itself out."
Fargo,1,Season 4 is feeling a bit like diminishing returns. Which is not to say the show is at all bad; it's still fun to watch and exceptionally well-made. It just doesn't feel as vital as it once did.
Fargo,1,"With a strong point of view, impeccable scenery and sharp acting (as usual), it's easy to forgive a rather slow start."
Fargo,1,"Another exemplary cast elevates wordless gestures and already witty lines into exciting entertainment, with Jessie Buckley and Glynn Turman being the overall breakouts, but this version of Fargo feels bleaker than any that preceded it."
Fargo,0,"All the details are wrong in every direction, either over the top or unbelievably absent."
Attack on Titan,1,"The premiere of Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 hits the ground running with brutal and absolutely savage action, some devastating reveals, emotional moments, and further blurring of lines."
Attack on Titan,1,"Shishido's direction did not manage to communicate so eloquently the increasingly complex narrative, although the fault lies at least as much on the original material. The one thing he does pretty well, however, is bring all the storylines together"
Attack on Titan,1,"Te final season's premiere continues Attack on Titan's deft focus on the no-win hell that is war, and while fans may miss those familiar faces, the new additions to the cast and their side of the story are sure to impress."
American Horror Story,1,"Despite the flaws, Red Tide manages to evoke a wide range of emotions over the course of six episodes. Its undeniably one of the most inventive, refined, and blood-curdling spectacles."
Riverdale,1,"Riverdale itself just embracing the utter insanity of the source material, especially when it’s done such a grand job of being so insane itself previously, is more of a lateral move than some huge leap."
Riverdale,0,"If the minds behind the show don't seem to care enough about the season 5 cliffhangers to start with them, why should the audience?"
Riverdale,1,"They've exaggerated their plots before and played with outlandish stories, but this 5-episode event series seems to be their way of embracing the full supernatural horror."
Riverdale,1,"For now, Rivervale is a deliciously fun place to be. Deep in the horror genre, it's a new twist on old structures, filled with high stakes, age-old curses, major character deaths, and a top-notch 4th wall-breaking narrator."
Riverdale,0,"special events are not canon, which means that it's all a meaningless stunt designed to incorporate The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into Riverdale and give K.J. Apa fans a brief heart attack."
All American,1,"All American continues its stride in acknowledging that college is not the only path, and Layla’s talent is strong enough that she can enhance her knowledge without needing to attend school."
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Killing Eve,1,"Season 4 ignores some of the emotional progress made in its predecessor and theres no indication in the first few episodes as to why Eve and Villanelle are once again at odds with each other, or what happened to the tenderness displayed on the bridge."
Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
Killing Eve,1,"Killing Eve may not be as good as it used to be when Phoebe Waller-Bridge was at the helm, but it’s still great fun."
Killing Eve,0,"We’re back in the same well-worn old saddle again, trotting around in the same tired old circles."
Killing Eve,1,"From the moment I heard the dulcet tones of Jodie Comer’s ­assassin Villanelle singing like an angel, in complete choir girl garb, I fell in love with Killing Eve all over again."
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
Killing Eve,0,This one’s over. It’s done.
Killing Eve,0,"Groundbreaking when it began, the caper starring Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh as cat and mouse, should probably have ended a couple of seasons back. What started as Tom and Jerry now resembles the complicated romance in Krazy Kat."
Killing Eve,1,There is something lovely about episodes that don’t include so much upheaval. But there’s also a restlessness to the writing and editing that feels uncomfortable with just letting its characters be.
Killing Eve,1,"With an attachment as twisted and complex at its center, Killing Eve can only aim its sights on a finale that ends with a bang rather than merely a whimper."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
Killing Eve,0,"Like many Peak TV plots, this one could have been resolved fifteen episodes ago. One senses the fatigue in the narrative with the very tone of the first episodes."
Killing Eve,1,"Comer is still on good form and Oh remains as mesmerising as ever. But, in spite of some good jokes, you do struggle to see the point of it all."
Killing Eve,1,"The programme is entertaining, and no viewer will regret spending an hour or two with it. But it’s hard not to expect and want something more from a project with this calibre of performers; it shouldn’t just be “fine”."
Killing Eve,1,"Now, in season 4, Eve, played by Sandra Oh, is once again the focus of the show, and it’s so much better for it."
Killing Eve,1,"Flawed though the show may be at this point, Oh and Comer remain one of the better double acts on TV, with each just as solid and enjoyable to watch on their own."
Killing Eve,0,"Fourth time around, the sense is of having spent too long on a carnival ride. Nausea is kicking in."
Killing Eve,0,"It’s still recognisably Killing Eve and it’s still kinda cool, but it’s out of new ideas."
Killing Eve,1,"It’s Comer and Oh’s performances that have kept us watching this far, and they remain the biggest reason to tune in, making Villanelle and Eve’s will they, won’t they dance captivating even when we’ve seen the steps before."
Killing Eve,1,"Familiar pleasures are still pleasures, and Killing Eve is nothing if not indulgent."
Killing Eve,1,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge is no longer involved but this is still bonkers-good TV, a rock ‘n’ roll, almost all-female take on the spy thriller."
Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.
Killing Eve,1,"When they do come into contact, the chemistry that Oh and Comer show off is, as always, palpable. Purposefully banal scenes and simple discussions become infused with an intensity that few other acting couples can produce on screen."
Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger."
Killing Eve,0,"Ever since the series’ first season, Killing Eve has been stuck in a weird holding pattern when it comes to these characters... And in the final season, don’t we -- and these characters -- deserve more?"
Killing Eve,0,"However it plays out for Eve and Villanelle, the end can’t come soon enough."
Killing Eve,1,"In its fourth season, the series remains keyed into the complicated symmetry between its two protagonists as they converge toward a final showdown."
Killing Eve,1,"Villanelle and Eve’s relationship is the heart, soul, and backbone of Killing Eve, a fact reinforced in Season 4. You better believe I am rooting for Villaneve to end up with a nice life, cool flat, fun job, and to watch movies together."
Killing Eve,1,"The problem with ""Killing Eve"" as a whole is that the show has to essentially reset itself every season."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"This season really put the idea of redemption into focus, and it served the narrative to perfection."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Episodes which have featured the return of deceased characters have been pretty dull, but there was just something about this particular episode that got everything so right."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"The Vampire Diaries premiered for the eighth and final time. Written by the show's creators, Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, the episode delivered nostalgia, horror, romance, friendship, brotherly love, and new mysteries."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"With series finales, TV shows are asked to do something they have never done before: properly end the story. The results are often, -forgive the pun - middling. The Vampire Diaries managed to beat the odds by following a few simple rules."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Either way, it's the happy ending they've always wanted. Excuse us, we'll be over in the corner, sobbing."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Julie Plec promised an ""emotional experience"" in ""The Vampire Diaries"" series finale, and that's exactly what we got."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"This wasn't a finale that took huge risks; rather, it was one that tried to sincerely give something back to its fans. Thanks, TVD. It's been epic."
The Vampire Diaries,1,The way people talk about Buffy today is how they're going to talk about TVD in years to come. It's not over. It's eternal.
The Vampire Diaries,1,The Vampire Diaries is and always was far better than it needed to be.
The Vampire Diaries,1,"For all the fanfare surrounding the return of Nina Dobrev for this finale, it always had to be them seeing the show off."
The Vampire Diaries,1,No I didn't cry as I wrote that. (Yes I did.)
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Through ups and downs, deaths and undeaths, The Vampire Diaries kept it wild, interesting and mostly fun."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"All told, it should make for an interesting run of final episodes."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"Knowing how fast The Vampire Diaries blows through plot this might not be the final evil, but at least it's being set up to be a good one. It's just what they need."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"The Season 8 premiere was a pretty wonderful episode, particularly if you enjoy when TVD goes full horror."
The Vampire Diaries,1,"[It] reminded me of the first season with it's scares, drama and mystery surrounding our new villain leaving us with a ton of questions like what does the siren want?"
The Sinner,1,"(...) At this point it is already clear that the entire series is Ambrose, and in that sense there is still a lot of fabric to cut. Deaths, intrigues, resolutions are no longer necessary: it would be enough just to see him."
The Sinner,1,"The eight-episode seasons would probably be better as six episodes and about two fewer hours of Ambrose's introspection... Still, the series satisfies an itch."
The Sinner,1,"As played with brooding subtlety and an inscrutable squint by Pullman, Harry's psyche is often as disturbing as the mysteries he solves in this unsettling series."
The Sinner,1,"It would be nice if this trip allowed Harry to heal from the Jamie-induced trauma. He needs a win, but something tells me that he will not be Percy's savior, no matter how badly everyone wishes it could be true."
The Sinner,1,"As always, Pullman is more than up to the task."
The Sinner,1,"The new cast is immediately striking, but the star of the series is clearly Kremelberg who gives an intensely tragic performance of Percy Muldoon."
The Sinner,0,The Sinner feels more like a familiar mystery series than it did at the best points in the first three years.
Catastrophe,0,"It's often snobby and more than occasionally mean. It has a thin, subtle story, and lacks memorable set pieces."
Catastrophe,1,"For a show that came on so strong, it's a curious but also brilliantly quiet way to go."
Catastrophe,1,"And yet their pain, manifested in family tragedy and fractious arguments about career and sex, brings us vicarious pleasure as Rob and Sharon wound, then cling to each other out of shared need and a desire to make the other happy."
Catastrophe,1,"And as much as these two may look like they're in trouble, the heart of this show has always been the tenderness that's clearly brimming under the surface of the acerbic wit of their unfiltered relationship."
Catastrophe,1,Few other shows have honoured the fullness of romantic love in all its complications with the same level of radical honesty.
Catastrophe,1,"As its characters have grown so has the show, becoming more meditative and complex, though it never loses the raw honesty that made it so excellent in the first place."
Catastrophe,1,See it and weep. Whether it's with laughter or with sadness will probably come down to which way you're tilting your head at the time.
Catastrophe,1,Season 4 feels like the rom-com we need during the Trump years.
Catastrophe,1,It's as gorgeous and transcendent a finale as the series deserves.
Catastrophe,1,"""Catastrophe"" will be remembered for its courage - not only by saying what others were only thinking, but for defending those thoughts and actions as a representation of real love."
Catastrophe,1,"While I enjoy Catastrophe, I'm not sure the show has ever done something that hit me as hard as its final scene."
Catastrophe,1,The final season of Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney's foul-mouthed romance is so lovely you don't want it to end. That's an increasingly rare feeling in television.
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe does, in its final moments, decide to say goodbye. And it does it in the way that it did everything: with a commitment to showing how ugly it can be to be honest, and how beautiful it is to have someone to be honest with."
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe's secret weapon was always its understanding of brevity, and in its final moments it leaves the audience wanting more."
Catastrophe,1,"An arresting final season closes one of TV's best series, though its breakneck narrative pace and curious final scene only leave us wanting more."
Catastrophe,1,"The fourth and final season of Catastrophe may not be its best... but it's the most affecting, thanks to the cumulative weight the series has built up."
Catastrophe,1,"""Catastrophe,"" it is clear, refers not to a single occurrence but to a state of being - the chaos of life, which this comedy depicts with deadly honest charm."
Catastrophe,1,"By the series finale -- which is aptly strange, beautiful, and ambiguous -- it just feels unfair that we have to let go of something so special."
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe will leave on as one of the greatest TV shows to ever exist, and one that never, ever jumped the shark."
Catastrophe,1,"It's not a spoiler to say the show ends quite appropriately, as it begins: with dangerous, devil-may-care action that may or may not result in a disaster better known as love."
Catastrophe,1,I can already tell it's going to be harder to get over the loss of this relationship comedy than it has been to move on from most of my own (often catastrophic) romances.
Catastrophe,1,"It is also always perfectly paced at every level; from the movement of a whole six-episode series, to every half-hour within it, down to the exquisite escalation - and, often even more perfectly, de-escalation - of their many marital rows."
Catastrophe,1,"While Catastrophe has always been good at the big stuff - death, dementia, addiction, infidelity, all dusted off with bracing frankness - it is a pleasure to see it being more straightforwardly silly."
Catastrophe,1,Season four feels like the right time for the show to end.
Catastrophe,1,"As Catastrophe season four unfolds, fans will find themselves dying at the exquisitely timed jokes, but this time with a little more appreciation for the craft at hand."
Catastrophe,1,"Each episode of the fourth season is building toward conclusions, but it's done subtly, hidden behind satisfying, self-contained conflicts. It's impressive how the series works toward and earns its climactic moments over the six episodes."
Catastrophe,1,This last season is a fantastic goodbye. Catastrophe never needed to evolve because it was always fantastic. [Full Review in Spanish]
Catastrophe,1,Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney seem to have decided that four series of their sublimely delusion-free comedy about modern marriage are enough. They're so wrong.
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe captured the daily texture of a marriage built on love, mean-spirited humour, clear-eyed cynicism, a deep and precise knowledge of each other's flaws, and constant, low-level fear."
Catastrophe,1,"A lot of comedies would have a neat way to tie this up and there's a revelation that... sorta does. But the show's heart isn't it in and, as always for Catastrophe, that's for the best."
Catastrophe,1,"So, the formula may be a reliable one, but no one could call Catastrophe predictable."
Catastrophe,1,"Humour is the best refuge from the multiplying setbacks that start in middle age, something Catastrophe knows all too well."
Catastrophe,1,"If you ever need a faintly filthy and bang on-the-money joke about Radiohead to perk up a self-help session the terrific Julie Hesmondhalgh is just yer lass for it: a welcome, dippy, addition to this achingly human, filthily human, comedy."
Catastrophe,0,Co-creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney still inhabit their roles with almost frightening conviction. But I do feel that enough will be enough in a few weeks' time.
Catastrophe,1,"It might have moved away from its initial shotgun premise, but Catastrophe, brilliantly, still knows something about living on the edge."
Catastrophe,1,"Catastrophe...is more than a sitcom. It is the reinvention of the narrative of parenthood. No, I don't think that is grandiose."
Catastrophe,1,Another deft mix of funny and serious from Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney.
Catastrophe,1,"There are so many things to love about Catastrophe, not least the way it pays attention to the smallest details in the matter of relationships."
Catastrophe,1,"This intimate, honest series is unafraid to tackle tough topics - addiction, depression, loneliness, financial insecurity, the stresses and struggles of parenthood."
Catastrophe,1,"Horgan and Delaney write Catastrophe together, and it distills their comic impulses quite beautifully... A loving report from the frontlines of routine tribulation."
Taboo,1,"Freshly unique, gloriously offensive, and delightfully vicious with superb costume design, an unbelievably talented cast, and a riveting story that thrives on reeling its audience in."
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Taboo,1,"The Hardys have created a period piece with a grim, noir feel, and ballsy execution. There are plenty of betrayals, murders, conspiracies and a clash of primitive and modern western values."
Taboo,1,"The actor, also the creator of the series, has a hypnotic presence halfway between a rhinoceros and a peacock. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Taboo,1,... an amazing Tom Hardy in one of his usual genius performances... [Full review in Spanish]
Taboo,1,Tom Hardy continues his uncontested reign as the most enthralling young actor currently alive.
Taboo,0,"As a showcase for Hardy's considerable acting chops, Taboo is passable, but once you peel away [Tom] Hardy's detailed performance you begin to realize that there's almost nothing to the character he's playing."
Taboo,1,"The formula of the show is well set: uncanny impressions, relentless passive aggression and a surprising amount of pathos, this time all soused in vino tinto."
Taboo,1,"If you could fathom what Hardy was growling, Delaney's closing run-in with Jonathan Pryce's East India Company boss suddenly put things on a knife-edge, promising just the sort of conflict you'd return for."
Taboo,1,"I want to be kind about the series because it looked fantastic. It had, as I say, great lines. There has not been such a blissful collective display of character acting for a while: the best supporting actor gong goes to the lot of them."
Taboo,1,"For not giving up on historical dramas, even if not perfecting the genre, Tom Hardy's Taboo deserves your attention. Give it some."
Taboo,1,"At the very least, with all the period detailing and potential for Back-Stabbing and Lies, it's filling the Game of Thrones void. And, seriously. Tom Hardy. Watch it for him alone. He's spectacular."
Taboo,1,"...call it Peaky Blinders: The Early Years, or Boardwalk Empire 1814 if you need a quick shorthand..."
Taboo,1,Tom Hardy delivers brooding silences and colorful dialogue with relish.
Taboo,0,"... if you have ever wished to know what you get when too many alpha males gather in a room, perhaps this is it."
Taboo,0,"This is the trouble with the show overall: It's just not clear, even after three episodes, what the fascinating James Keziah Delaney wants."
Taboo,0,[Taboo] silently bullies you into a reverence it probably doesn't deserve.
Taboo,1,"From the incest and exorcism scenes to the gunpowder plots, Tom Hardy's grubby, grimy, Georgian period drama is bonkers to the last."
Taboo,1,"The three episodes of the show broadcast thus far have given viewers enough reason to keep returning, if for no other reason than simply to take in Hardy's smouldering screen persona."
Taboo,1,The glimpses of London low life in the opening episode are tougher and more squalid than Dickens -- and not a wholesome family watch: Poldark it ain't.
Taboo,1,"Even at its most borderline-comically intense, Taboo remains watchable because Hardy (and supporting standouts Oona Chaplin, David Hayman and Jonathan Pryce) simply bewitches us into believing it's watchable."
Taboo,1,"What's most satisfying about this fine-tissued narrative is the way it keeps shifting, the way it takes on the excitements of, say, an Alexandre Dumas novel without quite ever going pell-mell for breathless derring do."
Taboo,1,"Tom Hardy's got a knack for playing enraged, muscled antiheroes, and his next small screen role looks to be capitalising on that same skill set."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is a grubby, swollen TV gothic that has its moments but, aside from Hardy and some atmosphere, not much else."
Taboo,0,"As Taboo goes forward, Delaney's mystical powers will inevitably play a more central role, but as of now, the promise that the show has some payoffs hidden up its sleeve isn't enough to slog through the dampness with these characters."
Taboo,1,"Dark, violent period drama explores a mysterious history."
Taboo,1,"The BBC's new historical drama is seductive and atmospheric, if completely baffling."
Taboo,1,"It all adds up to a dark, slow-moving but nonetheless intriguing drama with secrets to dispense in due time."
Taboo,1,"How you feel about Taboo probably depends on how gothic you like your historical dramas to be. Personally I'm a fan of period pieces stuffed full of doom, gloom and melodrama and served with side dishes of long-stewing revenge and simmering violence."
Taboo,1,"If Taboo can eschew its leanings into the outré in favor of the concrete, it will have more going for it than Tom Hardy's powerful presence."
Taboo,1,"The show is well made, well-written, and well acted. I am wrapped up in the deranged family drama and can't wait for their secrets to unravel."
Taboo,1,"The first episode's muted colors, dialogue-scarce scenes and preliminary plot set-up are worth plodding through for its penultimate showdown."
Taboo,0,"With listless pacing and no characters to care about... Taboo, you win. You're the best at being the worst."
Taboo,1,"Hardy is sensational, and the greater mysteries proposed by the writing are compelling enough to keep us on the show's hooks."
Taboo,1,The metaphorical gloom and doom of Taboo is likewise dense and relentless but so enveloping you can't help but be sucked in.
Taboo,1,"The first dip into this brutal world is slow-going, but the tempo and story pick up as the episodes go on."
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
Taboo,1,"I was heartily sick of gloomy, gritty TV shows, but engaging ones can't help but pull me in... I think I'm officially in."
Taboo,1,It's worth the effort.
Taboo,1,"Taboo's gruff and tough and silly, and I'm hooked."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
Taboo,1,"Hardy may want to mix in a romantic comedy sometime soon, if only for his own sanity. But for now, he's got demons to work out and it's an exorcism worth watching."
Taboo,1,Some of my tolerance is thanks to Hardy and his capable co-stars. Some of it thanks to Taboo's sumptuous period detail... There's enough intriguing stuff here to keep me watching.
Taboo,1,"This is clearly an obsessive, personal work, and it's intriguing on that level - more so if you're a fan of Tom Hardy, who has become the most exciting example of the Miserablist school of acting."
Taboo,1,Hardy's great - as always - but the story at times can be as turgid as the Thames in winter.
Taboo,1,"Hardy, always an admirably committed actor, has the magnetism to elevate even the silliest moments, making this an intriguing, if sometimes oppressively moody trip into a sinister underworld."
Taboo,0,"What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive - or any drive at all."
Taboo,1,"Three episodes deep, there's an appetite for more, but not a ravenous one."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Taboo,1,"Despite my rule about avoiding any TV show that could share its name with a provincial nightclub or a bottle of perfume won in a church tombola, Taboo proved too irresistible a prospect."
Taboo,1,"Taboo's strength is that, despite borrowing from westerns, gangster flicks and even Dickens, it still manages to feel utterly original."
Taboo,1,"It's definitely a Tom Hardy vehicle, but it's got a hell of an ensemble supporting him."
Taboo,1,"Hardy rocks the period clothing, strutting around in an open overcoat practically down to his ankles and a commanding stovepipe hat. With anyone else, this show would not be half as engrossing."
Taboo,0,"The focus on grim portentousness and rank atmosphere keeps bogging down the story, which needed more attention to achieve the balance it seeks among gothic bodice-ripper, Heart of Darkness social tract and corporate thriller."
Taboo,1,"FX dramas are invariably gritty, but the mood here seems organic to the story, in the way it did, say, on Deadwood. Whether Taboo can rise to that level remains to be seen, but based on first impressions, Hardy's TV return is pretty hardy indeed."
Taboo,1,"Brimming with all the sex and violence you'd expect from this aptly titled historical costume drama, Steven Knight and Tom Hardy's Taboo appears poised to deliver the promised goods well beyond its suppressed introductory episodes."
Taboo,1,"Taboo is perched somewhere between the utterly baroque, the intensely theatrical, and the routinely expositional."
Taboo,0,"As Hardy has demonstrated in several other projects, he is eminently watchable... But Taboo seems to have no idea what to do with his presence, short of giving him a scar and wrapping him in black broadcloth."
Taboo,0,"It's an utter slog, and the biggest creative misstep FX has made in a while."
Taboo,1,"It's an aggressive, fearless, and periodically nasty story filled with men who Delaney wants to kill, and told in a fashion that makes waiting all the more entertaining."
Taboo,1,"It's a rich mix of intrigues with the occasional bout of brutal violence as Delaney tries to build his own empire and assumedly reclaim his one true illicit love. Hopefully, along the way, he'll discover the joy of serial bathing."
Taboo,0,"All of the show's brooding and scheming goes nowhere, and the macho posturing of the various characters wears out its welcome pretty quickly."
Taboo,1,"It is filled with darkness, danger and mystery, and has a level of quality and import not often seen in television miniseries."
Taboo,1,"If you like your historical fiction grim and your cobblestones dirt-caked, if you don't mind looking into some of humanity's bleaker facets, this one's for you."
Taboo,1,"Despite 'Taboo's desire to show the dark and gritty aspects of Georgian London, it also has a style to it that is all its own."
Taboo,1,"It's a family drama, albeit dark and gritty, and it's a shame we only get eight episodes."
Taboo,1,"Despite coming out of the gates slower than is ideal in a crowded landscape, the series shows signs in the early going of blossoming into something much bigger and better."
Lost,0,"Watching ""Lost"" has been a bit like being pregnant. The thrill of discovery... Until it came down to a few final weeks, fueled by fevered anticipation and the wretched, bloated desire to just get the dang thing over with."
Lost,1,"Lost rewarded the devoted, providing a sense of relief for only those who really stuck by and with it."
Lost,0,"So I've given it another day to sink in, and I'm still profoundly irritated by that ending. It rendered this whole season of Lost pretty silly. And it barely made sense on its own terms."
Lost,0,"Lost crashed, and crashed hard... This season wasn't a long con. It was a weak trick."
Lost,0,The richest fantasy series I've seen. But its wrap-up sixth season is a drag: This spidery metaphysical puzzle seems to be dwindling down to a hokey primordial myth of good and evil.
Lost,1,"Satisfying in a sentimental way, the eagerly anticipated finale was neither as challenging as the series at its best, nor as convoluted as the series at its most frustrating. And it left enough questions to keep the watercooler humming for weeks."
Lost,0,"The series, which started with so much promise, stalled some time in its third season and will now be remembered as a monstrosity that fused kitsch to camp."
Lost,1,"In many ways, Lost did turn out to be a bit of a con... But the character stories were more consistent and the finale rewarded viewers who watched for the relationships."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.
Lost,1,"I've always thought it was one of the smartest-written shows on TV; certainly the most ambitious. I also knew that ABC kept this show around for prestige and Emmy consideration, but this was pretty good television -- like one long movie."
Lost,1,"There are finales that betray their lead-ups, but LOST isn't one of them. Instead, it dove right into the heart of the show to get to what made LOST stand out with every other television show that tried to capture the buzzy mystery element."
Lost,1,"The finale of 'Lost' is not bad. It is not the best that they could have offered, but it is not so horrible that it automatically invalidates all the rest of the series. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Lost,0,"The producer's foolishness in deciding to mix sprinklings of false faiths in with the true not only undercut the spiritual value of the show, it undercut the entertainment value of it as well."
Lost,0,"It became a show about placating, even sedating, fans, convincing them that, in the absence of anything coherent or challenging, love was enough."
Lost,1,"I can actually live with where they ultimately took this flash sideways business, for the most part, because I'm willing to accept the show for what it is."
Lost,1,"Remember Lost, because its type is not returning to TV anytime soon, if at all."
Lost,1,Lost has still got it.
Lost,1,"Trust me when I say we have questions and comments to be made during the hiatus. For now though, we're going to let the episode sit and marinate in our minds."
Lost,1,"For die-hard Lost fans, it was awesome to see so many references and appearances from classic characters, including a big one of Claire towards the end."
Lost,1,"Certainly it was more rewarding than The Sopranos and Seinfeld, both of which didn't end so much as stop, and we're grateful the writers didn't go the the route of Newhart or St. Elsewhere."
Lost,1,"To tell the truth, it seems as though there are more questions than ever that need answering, but at the same time, we're tantalisingly close to finding out the secrets of Ol' Smokey."
Lost,1,"Ultimately, Lost: Season 6 delivers closure on a story that has captivated us for so long."
Lost,1,"The finale, as good TV finales do, captured what the show's essence."
Lost,1,It was a sweet ending...it made some kind of sense.
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
Lost,1,At first it might seem difficult to embrace a parallel universe with the same emotional commitment demanded by the series thus far.
Lost,1,"I look at the state of TV now and I worry that it'll be a long time before we get another network drama that's both this ambitious and, far more often than not, this well-executed."
Lost,1,The joy of watching the Lost gang get back together certainly adds weight to the idea the producers have been pushing recently: that it's always been about the journey of the characters.
Lost,1,"Some of those actors are giving superlative, career-high performances - no one on TV today is showing greater range and emotion than O'Quinn, for example."
Lost,0,The feel-good moments at the end don't make up for six seasons of stringing viewers along without ever providing any real answers or any real closure.
Lost,1,"There are different ways to experience the show, and that's part of what makes it such fun."
Lost,1,"The themes persist, the characters persist, the mood persists, and the many, many great episodes persist."
Lost,1,It's that kind of human moment that will stick with me.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Henry Thomas leads a stellar cast dealing with a malevolent house that apparently loves the color turquoise.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Flanagan's appreciation for the classics in his Haunting projects proves compelling and unsettling.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Mike Flanagan does an excellent job of adapting the famous ghost story into an American gothic drama for a modern audience. A ten-part drama for Netflix, this review covers the first episode only."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"One of the best horror series ever made is, without a doubt, The Haunting of Hill House. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"...while the scares have been limited, the work done on building up the characters, their relationships, and what's at stake for them all has been phenomenal."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Most of the best moments from the book make it into the series.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Mike Flanagan really knows how to play with the audience and deliver scares with a great story.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Absolutely gripping from start to finish. Give it a few episodes to build, as it's a slow burn."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"A cinematic masterpiece of the small screen. One of the best Netflix original shows out there, and my favorite horror experience in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's atmospheric, with a nearly consistent undertone of dread, peppered with just the right amount of jump scares to spice things. Yet, at its heart, The Haunting of Hill House is much more than a ghost story."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Another achievement of Flanagan's vision is that the series never really feels overbearing or long - each episode is crafted to keep the audience engaged and on their toes with existential dream looming around every corner.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House brilliantly showcased relatable characters trying their best to conquer demonstrable villainy inside the house and inside themselves.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is both an absolutely terrifying ghost story, but it's also an emotionally devastating familial drama. And it's one of the best shows Netflix has released thus far."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House rewards those who aren't afraid to confront their own ghosts, those bumps in the past that still linger, and head back to where it all began. It's absolutely worth booking a room."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House redefines hauntings by centralizing the family and its relationship to the house, over the shock that the house produces. This is a human story and it's their interactions with the ghosts that build the story not just scare."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Trauma builds walls around us, but The Haunting of Hill House shines a light on the exit."

The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Horror is about dark delight, yes-but it's also about intensity, a quality in extremely short supply in Hill House."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Most frustratingly, the adaptation abandons the raw feminine perversity that made Jackson's story so indelible."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a new high watermark for episodic horror, not just standing up to past adaptations... but demonstrating that a show can be both dramatically complex and relentlessly scary."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"This is an original and fascinating look at family drama, one that refuses neat and tidy endings and begs us to consider what we ultimately do with a home we can never truly leave."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Even though it's not always easy, I'm willing to let my adrenaline spike if it means I can experience a story that captures my attention and doesn't let go for even one second. And that's exactly what Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House did."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's the pain, the loneliness, the desperation that grips their strained faces, pools in their eyes, and reaches across the screen to make you turn back on the lights. Now that, that feels real."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The horrors only grow, the jump scares keeping pace with an ever accelerating plot. And in its crescendo we are made to confront those things we would prefer to remain only objective observers to."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"With its exceptional melding of family drama and expertly-executed genre thrills, The Haunting of Hill House shouldn't be missed whether you're a card-carrying genre fan or not."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Every performance contributes to the family dynamic and helps to build anxiety throughout the series.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,What is perhaps most beautiful about The Haunting of Hill House is the way it both subverts the haunted house genre and then wholly genuflects to its cliches.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"As a tale of what happens when the ties that bind are the same ones that gag you, and scar you, and occasionally strangle you to death, it's absolutely terrifying."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Over 10 episodes, it's stylish, moving, and sinister, riddled with ghosts both literal and metaphorical."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Although the series starts slowly, it eventually develops into a riveting story, revealing a few horrifying secrets along the way and finishing on a surprisingly emotional note."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"A perfectly matched narrative, emotional and technical puzzle. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The show wisely does not decide to try and answer all the mysteries it presents to the audience. Sometimes there are no easy answers, in life and in television."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,It isn't the words that stick with you... It's the sight of the Bent-Neck Lady...
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Like this year's best horror film Hereditary, the chilling new Netflix series does an excellent job of wringing as much handwringing spooky boo-boo out of everyday events as it possibly can."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,What before ended on a note of sinister unease now leaves us with hope. And I guess we can be fine with that. There is no such thing as too much hope.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Fantastic, all around. The scares were there, subtle, and this show freaked me out. So good, and so well acted."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Stream it for sure. Like with any horror movie, there's a lot of build up in the first couple of episodes, but when The Haunting of Hill House gets rolling it doesn't stop."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It' ll reward your attention and patience with moments that will leave you breathless, on the edge of the seat, and turning on the lights throughout the house to sleep."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"What I'm most curious to discover is how Flanagan, who also wrote the show, plans to update the themes of the original to mirror contemporary American anxieties."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Between effective jump-scares, a cast led by the great TV actors Michiel Huisman and Elizabeth Reaser breathes life into an allegory for collective mourning."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"A limited series based on Shirley Jackson's influential ghost story, and it's worth the binge."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"If you're in the mood for slow burn horror and strong performances, The Haunting of Hill House is a powerful entry in the televison horror genre."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House comes ready to make itself right at home.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The horror is expertly paced - there's a slow ominous creep, then a sharp shock and that same adrenalin rush of relief that kicks in after going on a roller coaster."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Some stories work better as discrete two-hour movies, but the sad tale of the Crain family of Massachusetts benefits from a long, novelistic gaze."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Hill House is not just an affecting character-focused drama, but one that takes advantage of your investment in its intricately drawn-out story to produce scares that are twice as effective."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"While the structural issues could definitely use some tweaking, the fact that it's essentially a sprawling family drama punctuated with jump scares and a pervasive creepiness is pretty interesting."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Get ready to fall in love with the most beautiful doomed family on TV since the Fishers on Six Feet Under. This is what the spooky version of This Is Us looks like.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"[It] works as both a great horror story and a compelling family drama, effectively exploring how the ghosts of our pasts are just as scary as what goes bump in the night."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Well-acted and ponderously paced, The Haunting of Hill House would have benefited from less straining for the artistic and more of a desire to jolt its viewers."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,Flanagan retains the thematic core of the novel in some effective ways that we've highlighted below.

The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Hill House falls victim to a sagging middle section and could have benefitted from a smaller episode count. Nevertheless, the end result still adds up to a spooky series that hits the streaming service at just the right time."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Hill House's production design is stunning, creepy, and clever-the house has a kind of Overlook Hotel thing going on, where it's enormous but also confining."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"At once veering away any prior adaptation of Jackson's novel and paying tribute to staples of the horror genre, Hill House is an addictive slow burn of a binge that will have you biting your blanket in fear and tiptoeing in the dark."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The aesthetic of The Haunting of Hill House makes it work not only as horror TV, but also as a deft adaptation of Jackson."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,A literary classic is adapted into a modern masterpiece of trauma and terror.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Unlike Gerald's Game, Flanagan's greatest strength here is when he's playing with the story as opposed to being slavishly devoted to it. It's a reimagining for an era that doesn't know what that word means anymore."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,I found it perplexing and eventually irritating.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"What's remarkable is that Flanagan, thanks largely to stellar performances from the ensemble, manages to make all this sibling drama feel suspenseful rather than wearying."

The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting Of Hill House is not only a worthwhile update but one of the best horror TV series we've seen in years.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The best haunted-house stories aren't scary because they're filled with a long lineup of ghosties and ghoulies. They're scary because they want something from the haunted.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Its real potential lies in breaking the mold more than reapplying it. It's the people who haunt viewers more than the ghosts, and emphasizing the stories of the living is what makes Netflix's horror show come alive."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House is a surprisingly emotional family drama that mixes in jump scares to keep the blood pumping in between tears falling.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"For much of its titanic length, The Haunting of Hill House, which premieres Friday on Netflix, does interesting things with character and atmosphere and maintains an air of melancholic suspense."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Hill House is fiercely slow-burning, but can also unleash a deluge of frights at a moment's notice. Audiences won't want it to stop, and it won't...for ten episodes, anyway."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Things were going so well. Now here I am, out back in the cold of night, burying it."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Flanagan has made an intelligent, engaging supernatural story in which the tension doesn't mount so much as stop and start, and occasionally sputter."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's not just the family premise that makes this series so brilliant, but the characters as individuals themselves. Flanagan spends entire episodes giving the audience deft yet scathing vignettes of his characters' lives - and as always, it's a winner."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The real marvel of The Haunting Of Hill House is in its execution. Plot threads that initially may seem to go nowhere, or seem obvious, actually have welcome, complicated layers that reveal the relatable family dynamics..."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"[It] unfolds at too plodding a pace... But once the series establishes its storytelling approach, it hooks you in, compelling you to keep watching until certain mysteries are resolved."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House contains some of the most unforgettable horror imagery in film or television in years.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a special treat for horror fans, one of the greatest - and most satisfying - uses of the genre is this new, bingeable medium."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House is often scary as hell and possessed of enough character-centric nuance to carry viewers through to the end - even if some of the visceral frights peter out well before the conclusion.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's morgue-porn, but at least hints at a philosophical mystery."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The childhood/adulthood flashbacks are as good as This Is Us, the horror better than Hereditary, the whole thing better than the similar Castle Rock and Sharp Objects."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,What makes this rendition of Jackson's story so fascinating is the role femininity and domesticity plays in possessing the lives of a couple and shattering their family so completely that only a tragedy can bring them together as adults.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Some may find the story's slow-burning nature frustrating, but like Castle Rock, it's refreshing to see a psychological horror evolve a little more naturally than the usual rapid escalation."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Written and directed by Mike Flanagan, ""The Haunting of Hill House"" practically oozes with gothic horror. Dread, foreboding and general creepiness lurk around every corner in ways seldom seen on television."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"But it's a series that will stick in people's minds - not because of the familiar things it does, but for all the things it dares to do differently."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"There's something in the air ahead of a Flanagan scare. You know it's coming, but not from where. And that tension gnaws at you, curdling your stomach, pulling your fingertips to your agape mouth and maybe up over your wide eyes. It's a divine thrill."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a kind of riff on madness in its many forms, a sojourn of loss and regret."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,The Haunting of Hill House is decent and very much strives for a more classical horror vibe relying less on gore and more on supernatural scares.
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"The Haunting of Hill House is a frequently scary, surprisingly emotional saga focused on both past and present. Director Mike Flanagan takes Shirley Jackson's iconic haunted house novel and works into something wholly different, yet equally effective."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"It's as though Flanagan has taken Jackson's original work, shattered it and then rearranged the pieces to create a completely original, but equally brilliant tale."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"This is a new version of The Haunting for a new time, when the term 'ghosting' means something else entirely, and, although it's not always completely successful in its balancing of horror and heart."
The Haunting of Hill House,1,"Slowly insinuating, building in power as it tells a story of repressed trauma and family discord. It's an effective scare-fest that is at its best when the tale does more than jolt the viewer."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"It imagines cities every bit as breathtaking as those in that other Dick adaptation, 1982 film Blade Runner."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"It manages to fuse fantasy, history and sci-fi in one nerve-jangling, action-packed adventure."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"The series has a good starting point, makes unconvincing turns, but have good characters, on the edge of good and evil. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Man in the High Castle,1,"Though it's questionable whether the circuitous journey makes the destination worthwhile, The Man in the High Castle nevertheless builds toward a fascinating finale."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"While the series does a good job of showing that none of these people are purely bad, they've done terrible things, and now they're paying for them."
The Man in the High Castle,0,"So while on the one hand I commend showrunner Eric Overmyer and the producers for acknowledging the role African Americans play in every freedom fight this nation has been embroiled in - even ones in fictional, ""what if"" histories - thanks but no thanks."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"Season four allowed more time with Brennan Brown's Robert Childan, the antique dealer who is left somewhat in limbo... Their arc was a refreshing bit of light in a very dark season, and Brown deserves credit for doing a lot with often very little."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"The Man in the High Castle is still worth recommending, but it's a shame to see the show go out on its weakest season. The human drama is as strong as ever, but High Castle struggles to coalesce it into a coherent, impactful ending to its story."
The Man in the High Castle,1,These first five episodes suggest that we are going to have a high level season and a worthy finale. [Full review in Spanish]
The Man in the High Castle,1,"If you've stuck with the show all this time, however, this is your reward: a conclusion that's thematically rich, often exciting, and as satisfying a wrap-up to the series as one could hope for under the circumstances."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"It clearly doesn't take a genius to see where Man In The High Castle was always going to go in the end, but in getting us there, this well-weaved extravaganza does take its viewer on a wild and fufilling ten-episode ride."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"Those looking for bombast and overthrowing hate may find some disappointment...perhaps the point of The Man in the High Castle has never been about that, but rather instilling inspiration so that the fight will go on while trying to do the right thing."
The Man in the High Castle,1,"The show has left some of its less effective storylines at the wayside and strengthened its final season with only the best aspects of its strong characters, compelling alternate history, and mysterious but promising cross-dimensional possibilities."
Breeders,1,"Over two seasons, FX’s dark comedy Breeders has excelled at portraying the tough realities of parenthood. Its third, thankfully, is no different."
Altered Carbon,0,"For intriguing sci-fi action, stick with that strong first season. For the big questions, fellow Netflix original The Good Place is just a few short clicks away."
Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon's biggest asset is its visually amazing universe, and the endless possibilities that come with it. Season 2 is somewhat better than 1. [Full review in Spanish]"
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
Altered Carbon,1,"We're offered a bold new performance by Anthony Mackie, and this season also brings in exciting new characters while greatly exploring returning ones."
Altered Carbon,1,"Season 2 might seem like it has a lot of unnecessary layers to it, however, once you give those said layers time to grow, and a much closer look, then you'll see that there is a lot to be adored."
Altered Carbon,1,The action remains intense; it's just got more meaning.
Altered Carbon,1,"Mackie gives Kovacs a suitable sort of intensity and loose-limbed physicality... New showrunner Alison Schapker (Lost, Fringe) continues expanding a fascinating world out of the novels by Richard K. Morgan."
Altered Carbon,1,"At first it was hard to see where this season was going, and it seemed a bit less interesting than season 1. But ultimately, by the time you reach the end, it's hard not to be satisfied with the journey and the finale."
Altered Carbon,1,"It continues the overall premise of the first season while introducing a new lead, a new case and fresh cosmic terrains for interstellar action scenes. And it's still a lot of fun to follow."
Altered Carbon,1,"...sprawling, dense, fun, and weird as hell."
Altered Carbon,1,"It is strangely reassuring to know that, even in the 24th century, wearing a scuffed leather jacket over a black hoodie is still the universal symbol of anti-hero cool."
Altered Carbon,1,"Mackie feels like an upgrade on Kinnaman generally, although the overheated voiceover isn't doing him any favors."
Altered Carbon,1,"The distinct episodes help keep viewers invested when ""Altered Carbon"" goes too heavy on diegetic mumbo jumbo or changes its own rules to set up silly twists."
Altered Carbon,1,"Anthony Mackie and Will Yun Lee's stellar performances save this often underwhelming second season of Altered Carbon, and while it remains enjoyable and exciting viewing, the series might now benefit from a reboot."
Altered Carbon,0,"The story itself is somewhat downgraded from a provocative examination of the role mortality plays in defining our humanity to a soap opera with a whole lot of gratuitous punching, kicking, and bleeding."
Altered Carbon,1,"The story manages to breathe and present us something that is, directly, more entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Altered Carbon,1,"Thankfully, it seems creator Laeta Kalogridis and the series producers have taken this on board, and this time around there's not a ridiculously see-through gown or inexplicable nude scene in sight."
Altered Carbon,1,"It's no secret Mackie is a Hollywood veteran, but this is the first time he has had eight hours of screen time to stretch his legs as one character - and he is fantastic."
Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach."
Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon also succeeds at the level of breathtaking spectacle. After a stuttering first season, a would-be blockbuster has belatedly but emphatically achieved lift-off."
Altered Carbon,1,"By the season finale, it becomes clear that this has stopped being the Kovacs show and, instead, an ensemble endeavour that manages to satisfyingly tie up a season arc while teasing storylines yet to be explored."
Altered Carbon,1,"It still falls short of its potential, but Altered Carbon has probably done enough to ensure it runs for years to come. A lump of graphite, if not quite the full diamond."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
Altered Carbon,1,"Initially, Kovacs investigating the death of yet another meth is worrisome, but Altered Carbon manages to switch gears and deliver a much more cohesive and emotionally grounded season."
Altered Carbon,1,"Few TV shows manage to get the writing, acting, and directing right, but the second season of Altered Carbon will keep people talking for months, if not years after it hits the air."
Altered Carbon,1,"It combines what worked best in the show's first year with a more intimate and important mystery, which makes for a more compelling story."
Altered Carbon,1,"A worthy followup that, at times, surpasses the first season with a more expansive universe that stretches far beyond the confines of Bay City."
Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon takes place in the future, but its message stands firmly in the now."
Altered Carbon,1,"Altered Carbon is in good hands with Anthony Mackie taking the role of Kovacs in season 2, and first few episodes outline a strong story that honors both the original character and the introductory adventure in all its dark and violent glory."
Altered Carbon,1,"It's not without its issues, and some of the acting and writing does get very trite in places, but by and large, 'Altered Carbon' Season 2 proves itself to be an intriguing, entertaining dive into pulpy cyberpunk silliness."
Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show."
Altered Carbon,1,The personal touches keep the characters grounded even when they're waxing poetic about the nature of life and their place in the universe.
Altered Carbon,0,"Altered Carbon has an amazing sandbox to work with, but the story doesn't always know how to play in it... The good news is that Season 2 ends on a note that could make Season 3 its best yet."
Altered Carbon,1,"While we're not quite there yet, future seasons of Altered Carbon will hopefully fix those aforementioned issues entirely, creating something that can truly ""stack"" up to the sci-fi greats that Morgan so readily draws inspiration from."
Altered Carbon,1,"This season is less horrifying, less gruesome and in some ways a little less bombastic, but it's also maybe a little more nuanced or less melodramatic."
Altered Carbon,1,"Boasts a leaner, more easily digestible cyberpunk thriller than its predecessor with surprise new sleeves, new characters and superbly crafted action."
The Ipcress File,1,It’s an intricately plotted series that doesn’t glamorize spy work so much as make clear just how awful it can be.
The Ipcress File,1,"The excellence of the cast lends weight to this series, which, even if it lacks the satiric edge of the original novel, is a well-executed addition to the spy genre."
The Ipcress File,1,"While there are references and homages to the 1965 movie, the series does not attempt to be a recreation of the film and that's the main reason why it's so enjoyable."
The Ipcress File,1,"The five-episode mini-series is a mystery drama delight. File under: ""Recommended Viewing."""
The Ipcress File,1,"Overall, it’s engaging and full of atmosphere. Nothing beats a well-told Cold War spy story."
The Ipcress File,1,The Ipcress File has the makings of a compelling espionage yarn and it may yet find its own identity.
The Ipcress File,1,"This is fun. The script sizzles, the story is terrific in its silly way, and it is stunning visually."
The Ipcress File,1,"It spared no effort in its quest to show us that the Britain of 1963 was on the Brink of Social Change. And yet, neither of these things really got in the way of its main aim: to be as cool and stylish as the 1960s films and TV it was paying tribute to."
The Ipcress File,1,"It is satisfying to see spying represented in such cartoonish colours, as well as a rose-tinted retrospection on the red scare."
The Ipcress File,1,"Remarkably, screenwriter John Hodge and director James Watkins have created a show that expands and develops the story while capturing something of the spirit of the movie."
The Ipcress File,0,"The world has turned, and turned again. These old games feel a bit silly, a bit staid: misplaced nostalgia masquerading as thrilling sensation."
The Ipcress File,1,"Who knew a racy period spy caper could feel so, well, of the moment. Which is both a pleasing but also terribly sad thing to have to say."
The Ipcress File,1,"Gorgeous period stylings, an atmospheric production and assured direction all do justice to Len Deighton’s Cold War spy story, first published in 1962."
The Ipcress File,1,"It's all satisfyingly old-fashioned, crammed with period atmosphere but never falling for the temptation to be over-stylised."
The Ipcress File,1,"The contemporary resonances are unmissable, even if the makers of this six-part adaptation of Len Deighton’s 1962 thriller couldn’t have envisaged their audience would be playing extras in a real-life cold war sequel."
The Ipcress File,1,"It’ll be near-impossible to displace Caine as the definitive Palmer, but Cole certainly gives it a good shot."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Hugh Grant is not the adorable rom-com hero you may know him as in this kicky, hilarious limited series."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Screenwriter Russell T. Davies delights in scabrous retorts and daft schemes, but the two main characters are captured with illuminating detail and an understanding that personalities can have contradictory extremes."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant's Thorpe is charismatic company yet essentially deeply sad, a stranger even to himself. It's a very English kind of suffering."
A Very English Scandal,1,'A Very English Scandal' chooses humor as a combat weapon: because the oppressors are won with laughter. [Full Review in Spanish]
A Very English Scandal,1,"This masterful drama certainly resurrects the seedier, more headline-grabbing elements of the case and retells them with stunning panache and beautiful comic timing - but the effect now is... to put that version of England on trial."
A Very English Scandal,1,"If it's difficult to see Thorpe as a victim from the first two episodes, it's a scene in A Very English Scandal's closing episode that renders Davies' point crystal clear."
A Very English Scandal,1,"As it is, because the true events it so deftly depicts are largely unknown to American audiences, the three-part A Very English Scandal will make for very satisfying mini-binge on Friday night or this weekend."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant is capable of far more range, emotion and subtlety than many of his roles allow, and he gets to show that off here, somehow giving this portrait of a master manipulator some humanity in the process."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Russell T Davies pens the three-parter and -- as with all of his work -- he expertly blends comedy with the drama, and the end result is something magnificent."
A Very English Scandal,1,Mind you - and this is the beauty of the story - nothing is straightforward.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Thorpe was a thoroughly bad egg, but thanks to Grant's mesmerising performance, one you're happy to spend some time with."
A Very English Scandal,1,"There is an appealing madcap quality to all three episodes of the show, but the series reaches its dramatic peak in the final installment, with wonderful courtroom scenes."
A Very English Scandal,1,"You get the officiousness, the fear, and the ambitiousness in [Grant's] performance."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Whishaw's performance as Scott, a symphony of insecurity and need, works as a perfect stylistic complement to Grant's charismatically double-sided Thorpe."
A Very English Scandal,1,Grant is just so thoroughly likeable and even the character of Thorpe is drawn with wit and affection.
A Very English Scandal,1,"If you think British historical dramas are all decorous whisperings about how one should behave upon meeting the queen, this mini-series is here to prove that notion wrong."
A Very English Scandal,1,"What makes A Very English Scandal land, and not careen too far into silliness, is how genuinely grounded it is."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Although A Very English Scandal will probably best be remembered for the two incredible performances at the heart of its narrative, it is also a careful study in how to balance a story in which the truth is almost certainly stranger than any fiction."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Positively Clintonian in his rakishness, charm, and preternatural ability to enjoin people to clean up his many messes, Thorpe oozed charisma-which Grant captures brilliantly."
A Very English Scandal,1,"It was exhilarating and dynamic, this tragicomedy of errors, without sacrificing the ability to say something serious amid all the madness. A sensational adaptation, in every sense of the word."
A Very English Scandal,1,Great acting in political sex scandal miniseries.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Ben Whishaw as Scott mesmerizingly combines the vulnerable and the determined, with a determination born of principle as much as need."
A Very English Scandal,1,A Very English Scandal recreates the almost 20 years of the Thorpe case with precision and sensibility. [Full Review in Spanish]
A Very English Scandal,1,"This BBC miniseries (three episodes) has much to recommend: an amusing script, energetic pacing, and a sweetshop of delicious period details from the late '50s through the early '70s."
A Very English Scandal,1,"This is a confident historical series packed with amazing performances, political intrigue and a propulsive story."
A Very English Scandal,1,A Very English Scandal seemingly does the impossible: kicking a very dramatic narrative into goal but lining it with some uproarious moments and a lot of humour.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Equal parts sinister and disarming, Grant's Jeremy makes the film work."
A Very English Scandal,1,[A Very English Scandal] revels in every weird twist and turn of the story. The tone of the miniseries shifts between broad comedy to poignant tragedy...
A Very English Scandal,1,There are few stories on TV told as well (and as brief) as this one. [Full review in Spanish]
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant and Whishaw play their parts heartbreakingly well, especially Grant, who manages to make Thorpe both tragic and loathsome."
A Very English Scandal,1,It's a quicksilver performance that helps you understand how the man could have been both magnetic and repellent all at the same time.
A Very English Scandal,1,"""A Very English Scandal"" is funny and constantly engaging, whether you know the real-life events or not. Yet I was ultimately frustrated that it could have been even better."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Frears has long been a great actor for directors... Here, he brings the absolute best out of Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw, who give riveting performances in the telling of one of the U.K.'s most shocking political scandals. This is a must-see."
A Very English Scandal,1,A Very English Scandal continues to swing back and forth... between madcap farce and historical tragedy.
A Very English Scandal,1,"At its core, A Very English Scandal is a very dark and sad tale, but you might not really notice it at first, because it's so very fun to watch."
A Very English Scandal,1,"A Very English Scandal is witty, wry, and offers up an addictively rollicking sense of pace and tone, leaning into the absurdity of this tragic controversy."
A Very English Scandal,1,A delicious three-part import with a first-class pedigree...
A Very English Scandal,0,"""A Very English Scandal"" plays too much with tragedy."
A Very English Scandal,1,Grant is a revelation.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Still it's hard to deny the overwhelming force that dominates everything about this enterprise, namely its buoyant comedy, much of it lashing wit or a softer spoofing."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Real life does not always lend itself to dramatic adaptation, but Davies and Frears manage to make of it something both thoughtful and antic, historical but only in the brief asides a history lesson."
A Very English Scandal,1,"As a playground for Whishaw and Grant, A Very English Scandal soars."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Justice may not be served, but the lucky viewer is."
A Very English Scandal,1,"A funny, sad, engaging winner."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Simply, a triumph."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Whishaw gives a performance that is the equal of Grant's in skill and nuance. His Scott is handsome, winsome, vulnerable, and unstable."
A Very English Scandal,1,"""A Very English Scandal"" is a dazzling three hours and in pace and potency puts ""The Crown"" to shame."
A Very English Scandal,1,There's fun galore in A Very English Scandal.
A Very English Scandal,1,"There is an eccentric bit of electricity that runs through A Very English Scandal, one of the tightest and brightest and most sublime miniseries that you're likely to see on television in 2018."
A Very English Scandal,1,"A richly textured true-crime miniseries that is, by fascinating turns, painful, witty, brutal, touching and darkly humorous."
A Very English Scandal,1,Three hours is enough time for two great actors to craft performances whose collision-and an enmity that comes to look a bit like love-is some of the more edifying fun around.
A Very English Scandal,1,"It's a fascinatingly sordid story, and yet somehow instructive, showing how attitudes have changed - not only toward homosexuality but also in the way victims of powerful predators were judged."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant is magnificent as the charming but quietly monstrous politician, ditto Whishaw as the model who turned out to be made of stronger, finer stuff than many of his so-called elders and betters."
A Very English Scandal,1,"It's become tediously predictable to praise this drama but, as Thorpe, Hugh Grant really has proved he's getting better as he's getting older..."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Grant, in particular, brings a lugubrious playfulness that still haunts."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Heavy, you probably imagined, and maybe even harrowing, but as written by Russell T Davies and directed by Stephen Frears, the touch is so skilfully light it whizzes along and is supremely entertaining."
A Very English Scandal,0,"It's an enjoyable romp, forgettable candyfloss, although it struggles to stop short of proselytising about homosexuality. If you want to say something serious about gay rights, this is not the story."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Yet, if not that much really happened, it was still a constant delight."
A Very English Scandal,1,"[Hugh Grant] manages to add a note of paranoid cruelty to the politician's glad-handed arrogance, as he melts in an angry cardigan beneath a mocking crown of Vitalis."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Hugh Grant is Thorpe, and everything about his performance is exactly so. In middle age, his particular charm has a somewhat cobwebby quality, which seems just right."
A Very English Scandal,1,Hideously entertaining.
A Very English Scandal,1,A Very English Scandal has managed to capture both the tragedy and the farce of this most peculiar of political sex scandals.
A Very English Scandal,1,"It is a drama as brutally funny, endlessly clever, justifiably confident as its protagonist; an immaculately-scripted hour that entwines two decades of salient political history with a finely-worked portrait of the English establishment..."
A Very English Scandal,1,"Briskly paced and funny when it can be, A Very English Scandal makes a good case for the Thorpe affair as the ""trial of the century."""
A Very English Scandal,1,"A Very English Scandal sees writer Russell T Davies finally getting his wish to work with [Hugh] Grant. It's been worth the long wait for both of them - and for us, too."
A Very English Scandal,1,"In TV terms, though, [A Very English Scandal] was a diamond."
A Very English Scandal,1,"A Very English Scandal is a fascinating, appalling and often scathingly funny journey through the putrescent innards of the British political establishment."
A Very English Scandal,1,But he does much more than merely look the part. Grant shows us a political psychopath incapable of shame.
A Very English Scandal,1,"Gripping, yes, and a superbly executed one in A Very English Scandal, as professionally and carefully wrought as Thorpe's own life was chaotic and risky."
Mad Men,1,"Season 7 provides a bittersweet but hopeful capstone on a series which essays, often remarkably, a period of American history that remains resonant today."
Mad Men,1,Emotional. Brilliant. Poignant. Significant. Fun. Beautiful.
Mad Men,1,This series that launched a thousand Eames knock-offs looked a-mazing. Weiner's visual attention to period was evident to anyone who saw it and the subject of a TV industry fable...
Mad Men,1,"Mad Men smashes history, desires, dreams, and life's mundanity together like Douglas Sirk's Large Hadron Collider. It's a classic."
Mad Men,1,It will cost a lot to fill the gap left by Mad Men. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mad Men,1,"Mad Men isn't back with its old saucy, sexy, 60s colour, but has ripened into something darker and more troubling."
Mad Men,1,"We have a few interesting threads to follow, and a warm welcome back into the contemplative, ambiguous world of Mad Men. It'll be interesting to see if it reflects its narrative split until 2015, but for the moment, consider us fully enamored."
Mad Men,1,Weiner has said that each will be like a finale. The opening one has been a terrific beginning of the end.
Mad Men,1,It's that inexorable tug and pull between the past and the future that's at the heart of Mad Men and its characters... as they reach the end (or new beginning) of the line.
Mad Men,1,Don's fears of death and the futility of his accomplishments are the natural extensions of the show's meditations on the mid-century American Dream. And yet this is territory the show has already trod over several times with Roger.
Mad Men,1,"One of Weiner's greatest achievements is to make something as banal as a firm pitching to advertise fast food (or a camera, or a cigarette, or whatever), seem worthy of the viewers' tears and devotion."
Mad Men,1,Mad Men's seventh season has done some of its best work so far by leaning on its own weighty past.
Mad Men,1,"A glorious, subtle show."
Mad Men,1,I find it fascinating to watch this show push around the concept of identity in regards to this ensemble.
Mad Men,1,The main event tonight is the return of Mad Men with all of the style and swagger one expects from a show that's been playing at the height of TV possibilities since the start.
Mad Men,1,"I still find the series compelling to watch, for the acting and for the writing. This end game is ramping up expectations which will be difficult to deliver on."
Mad Men,1,"The hour delivers a series of lovely closing scenes that find Don feeling more honest intimacy than he has felt since the death of Anna, culminating in the kind of image and song choice that Mad Men fans find so powerful and moving."
Mad Men,1,It was a fantastic entry into the season and one that already makes me long for another season we will never have.
Mad Men,1,"The show has never been about wrapping up a plot, catching a criminal, or solving a riddle. It's simply about taking a certain group of characters over a set span of time-the 1960s-and showing us who they are at the beginning and the end of it."
Mad Men,1,"In any case, I ate this episode up, from the realistically tender state of Don's marriage onward. This show may be a timepiece. But it's also, for better or worse, a conversation piece."
Mad Men,0,"There are peaks and valleys, but mostly there's a lot of flat, ugly middle. The victories that you spend forever building end up being as ephemeral as fireworks, sparkling briefly before quickly fading back into the endless blackness of the nighttime sky."
Mad Men,1,"""Time Zones"" was a good episode. It was funny in the way that Mad Men usually is, it was gorgeously filmed and impeccably acted, and it was deceptively sad. In other words, it was quintessential Mad Men."
Mad Men,1,"Answers will come. Actions will be taken. We just don't know when, how, or by whom. Embrace the intrigue, the subtle shifts in character, and Weiner's careful plotting."
Mad Men,1,It's fantastic to have this conversation piece back on a weekly basis.
Mad Men,1,"It's beautiful to look at, and yes, it's full of things to unpack. And there will be time for that."
Mad Men,1,"It's well-written, and beautifully framed, and we see some characters who have evolved considerably already, and are on clear paths to change even more, along with the times themselves."
Mad Men,0,Each season is starting to resemble an animated cartoon where the same landscape rolls by over and over again. We've seen a lot of these story lines before.
Mad Men,1,"As fans obsess over every nuance of new Mad Men episodes, I hope the show answers one of our biggest questions: whether Draper can find peace in a truthful life or will surrender to the lies."
Mad Men,1,I was tickled by a surprise twist near the end of the episode that sets up some delicious skulduggery to come.
Mad Men,1,"We won't be able to fully appreciate it from moment to moment, because we're so eager to learn what's coming next, to get to whatever the future holds. But that future is a world without Mad Men, so let's not get there too fast."
Mad Men,1,The equivalence of Don and Freddy is actually far more pronounced than previously imagined.
Mad Men,1,"On a show all about advertising and projecting a certain image, it's very entertaining when the show can actually play with the idea of how the media can sell us something."
Mad Men,1,"This is a show that loves ambiguities, digressions and oblique angles. Not many shows could pull that off, but Mad Men has the kind of cast that makes watching people think and react a real pleasure most of the time."
Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread."
Mad Men,0,The characters got the wake-up calls last season. The writers need one this season.
Mad Men,1,"""Time Zones"" may not've been the most energetic start to Mad Men's final season, but like any good airplane landing, the descent has to be gradual. The end is nigh, but we're still en route."
Mad Men,1,"Mad Men is always aware of its own bigness; it's deep, but it's also cool and crowd-pleasing."
Mad Men,1,Don Draper's introduction is one of my favorite things about this episode.
Mad Men,1,"A new day is approaching, and Don seems unprepared for what lies ahead."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
Mad Men,1,"Characters, settings, and levels of cool are all swapped out indiscriminately, leaving us to piece together the real situation only as fast as Hornbacher and Matthew Weiner (on script duty) allow it."
Mad Men,1,"Tonight's episode felt lighter than Mad Men has been in a long time, as though Don coming clean had lifted a weight off the entire series."
Mad Men,1,"It's too early to tell, too early even to smell the smoke, but in the meantime, we'll wait for things to heat up. Because this is the beginning of something."
Mad Men,1,"Here's a prediction about the final season: Peggy is the one to watch. Her journey is the one people are going to be blogging, tweeting and talking about."
Mad Men,1,"It's an excellent starting point for an episode that, even more than the average Mad Men premiere, has to spend an awful lot of time (especially given that it's our first one-hour premiere in a few years) filling us in on what happened during the hiatus."
Mad Men,1,"Welcome back, Mad Men, you old day brightener, you."
Mad Men,1,"Even though its opener is moody and a bit muddled, Mad Men still brims with sex, symbolism and surprises, as well as television's finest ensemble."
Mad Men,1,It's as watchable as ever.
Mad Men,1,"Let's just say that if last season left you wondering whether the time had come to bail, tonight's premiere may convince you to wait at least a few more weeks before you decide."
Mad Men,1,"In the often bleak world of Mad Men, the women are stealing the spotlight, and that's not such a bad thing."
Mad Men,1,"The show has nothing to teach us. It's just being honest about the truths people discover and then disregard, and the lies they tell themselves, as history moves around them. They're doing the best they can."
Mad Men,1,"The writing, by Weiner, direction by Scott Hornbacher and performances are, of course, top-notch."
Mad Men,1,"It's the fetishizing of the visual, not lack of action, that leaves me impatient. But for now, we're on a plane and Weiner's in the cockpit... I don't know where we're going and neither do you. Might as well sit back and enjoy what's left of the ride."
Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.
Mad Men,1,"Mad Men is beautifully shot as always, with the dialogue flowing naturally and meaningfully over alcohol... The pace hasn't quickened. Nor does the storyline congeal. Instead, Sunday's re-opener builds to a terrifically poignant finish."
Mad Men,1,"Wherever this American saga is taking us, the getting there is likely to be exhilarating."
Mad Men,1,"AMC's much-acclaimed Mad Men feels like it's coming out of a pit stop, rechecking gears and reacclimating to the track."
Mad Men,1,"The premiere lacks the gravitas of last season's heavily symbolic opener, but it sets the stage for what promises to be a tumultuous, enticing end run."
Mad Men,0,"The start to the bifurcated final season feels more indifferently paced than most - and thanks to the gradual push further into the 1960s, perhaps too groovy and scattered for its own good."
Mad Men,1,"Mad Men is back, looking as vibrant as ever."
Mad Men,1,"It is many things at once, including absolutely fantastic."
13 Reasons Why,1,"Awkward, complex and extremely difficult to watch, It doesn't go out on a fluffy high, but stays true to its issues and discussing difficult subjects, it would break most strong-minded adults, let alone vulnerable teens."
13 Reasons Why,1,"While season four has its bumps in the road, the lens does not falter, keeping its focus locked on the wreckage these teens not only create for themselves but the issues the world has created for them."
13 Reasons Why,0,The team behind 13 Reasons Why had no way of knowing that audiences would be watching this season in the middle of a pandemic. But that only makes the sadistic nature of the material that much more glaring.
13 Reasons Why,0,"The show's myopia isn't surprising. If anything, the final season proves once again that teen viewers deserved better than what 13 Reasons Why offered, and if the show is remembered in a few years, it'll be mostly for what it failed to do."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Readers may recall how promising this show was at the beginning, when it was simply the adaptation of an acclaimed young adult novel... The final season reclaims only crumbs of that sensibility."
13 Reasons Why,0,"There's no revenge story here; no real mystery; and no one gets their comeuppance. It drifts until the shocking death, which erases most of the storyline that came before it, or at least reduces it to an afterthought."
13 Reasons Why,1,"It's not always successful, but it does have its moments, offering up some refreshing character journeys along the way. As for some of the more infuriating moments, they are, as always, elevated by an incredibly talented cast."
13 Reasons Why,0,"13 Reasons Why was frustrating and difficult, but it's over, and there will be no looking back."
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
13 Reasons Why,0,"Laves nothing to chance, wrapping up almost every major loose end in what is now surely the show's trademark: throw every possible hot button issue into a blender and mash the switch labeled ""the power of friendship and de-escalation"" until smooth."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]

Only Murders in the Building,1,Only Murders remains a story about murder that glorifies true crime podcasters... But the show is also refreshingly honest about a burgeoning industry’s nosiness and penchant for exploitation.

Only Murders in the Building,1,A cozy summer watch.

Only Murders in the Building,1,"There are a few series that manage to get better during their second season, but that's exactly what has happened with Only Murders in the Building. [Full review in Spanish]"
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Short is just as vain, theatrical and ridiculous. Gomez is still edgy and curt (although more vulnerable). Martin is even more Steve Martin. What more could you want?"
Only Murders in the Building,1,The lead trio’s chemistry remains a highlight and the central question of who murdered Bunny Folger proves to be a strong enough throughline to anchor Only Murders’ second season through some of its sophomore slumping.
Only Murders in the Building,1,The world of Only Murders expands in season two ... almost always for the better.
Only Murders in the Building,1,"There is so much to love here. Our trio continues to grow together, and their development is top-notch. The new characters work (for the most part), and the mystery will keep fans on their toes."

Only Murders in the Building,1,"Unlike the true crime podcasts the show satirizes, doesn’t go into a sophomore slump after a great first season. Now that its comic rhythms are well-established, it actually feels like the show may be even better in Season 2."

Only Murders in the Building,1,"Continues to be a great, sharply written, perfectly executed comedy."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"This new run plays to this show’s many strengths, principally the sharp and multilayered writing from a large scriptwriting team and nicely modulated performances that allow for speedy tone switches when things threaten to get syrupy."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Each of our detectives is a puzzle missing a piece — a lover, a child, a friend — and as the season expands, so does its human scope."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"""Only Murders"" successfully avoids a sophomore slump."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"... Doesn't shine as bright. It's like they took your favorite, perfectly cooked dish and swapped it for a similar one with less tasty ingredients, it just doesn't sit right after you had so much trust in the chef. [Full review in Spanish]"
Only Murders in the Building,1,"By combining new characters with old and treating them all with the same mixture of understanding, humor, and doubt, Only Murders in the Building continues its special ways of suspense."

Only Murders in the Building,1,"Only Murders In The Building just keeps getting better. It may be the smartest, most satisfying “sitcom” since Seinfeld."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Needless to say, ""Only Murders"" remains catnip for fans of Martin and Short, and a rare kind of cross-generational connection. It’s marvellous."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"A funny thing happens mid-season here, in that what begins as truly laugh out loud hilarious turns into a far more serious, introspective dramatic whodunit."
Only Murders in the Building,1,"Season 2 is here to feed those hungry Hulu subscribers. It should do just that, even if the second course is a bit messier than the first."

Only Murders in the Building,1,"A bigger, funnier, more ambitious season."

Normal People,1,This smart and sensual adaptation is powered by its two impressive young stars.
Normal People,1,"It's the best depiction of anxiety I've ever seen on screen, and my favorite debut performance of the year."
Normal People,1,Two fresh new stars - Edgar-Jones and Mescal - illuminate the ups and downs of a high school though college relationship. Fascinating to watch.

Normal People,1,Normal People... is a gorgeous piece of television.
Normal People,1,"I loved the early university bits particularly, which captured so well the experience of arriving in a new place and meeting new and intriguing people."
Normal People,1,"What sustains and elevates the show, even at its dullest, is the formidable artistry evident just beneath the surface."
Normal People,1,"On the surface, the show might end by suggesting a brighter future, but that one glancing note of positivity can't override the overwhelming feeling evoked by the series."
Normal People,1,The lovely and realistic 12-part series benefits from the unnuanced performances by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal.
Normal People,0,"I kept yearning for these mouthwateringly beautiful people to be more convincingly nasty to each other, for the romance to take on palpable energy, fizz, danger, real sadness."
Normal People,1,Normal People is a romance epic that miraculously manages to escape its youthful roots and evolve into something deeply thoughtful and life-affirming.
Normal People,1,"More striking is the series' steady, unhurried pacing and its willingness to examine the weight of memory and regret. The series' insistent quietude either seduces you immediately or leaves one cold."
Normal People,1,"Normal People is its most real at these moments, when it shows how coming from a wealthy family gives you an advantage in college."
Normal People,1,"Edgar-Jones brings a mesmerising vulnerability, while Mescal (in his breakout role) muddles the words in his mouth before he speaks, taking great care with the dialogue that Rooney uses so sparingly."
Normal People,1,"An example of a hotly anticipated show that actually has managed to live up to the hopes so many had for it, Normal People is your next very Irish, very emotional watch."
Normal People,1,"It is the very ordinariness of Normal People, though, that makes it an unmissable small screen treasure, an achingly everyday love story in which we might find, reflected, pieces of our own."
Normal People,1,"It's a beautifully done series about love, sex, and class in Ireland that features a pair of indelible lead performances."
Normal People,0,The result is hardly incompetent but never bold enough to transcend the standard literary adaptation.
Normal People,1,"Handled the way it is, the physical becomes an intellectual tool and a window into character. That the people involved are very beautiful doesn't hurt, of course. But viewers will ultimately love Normal People for its mind."
Normal People,1,I've never seen a love story like it on television before.
Normal People,1,"Rooney fans can take solace knowing the novel has been faithfully, earnestly transposed to the screen. Everyone else will have an opportunity to finally discover what all the fuss is about."
Normal People,1,"So, while I never warmed to Marianne you have to give her grudging respect: she's a girl who knows what she wants."
Normal People,1,"Missing, still, however, is the inherent messiness of two teenagers in love. There's certainly plenty to admire in the production's lacquer. But it makes it harder to see the flesh-and-blood youths on the other side."
Normal People,1,"Edgar-Jones and Mescal are called upon to delve into deeper wellsprings of trauma and both do so credibly, without succumbing to the temptation to oversell the drama."
Normal People,1,"It's one of the best works of TV I've watched so far this year, and the rare show during this pandemic stay-at-home saga that made me forget everything else."
Normal People,1,"Edgar-Jones and Mescal have incredible on-screen chemistry. They make the connection between the characters feel real, and when the two are on screen together, it's impossible to look away."
Normal People,1,"All of this is extremely faithful to the novel. The big difference is the series's tone and willingness to live in its feelings... I found it all moving and emotionally wrecking, in the best way."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
Normal People,0,An experience tantamount to being stuck on a bad date that refuses to end.
Normal People,1,"Powerfully demonstrates the maxim of 'show, don't tell': it translates an intensely interior story to a visual medium using mood and tone..."
Normal People,1,"Above all, Normal People is an open-hearted drama, brimming with optimism, pain, despair, and rapturous joy. Much like the novel, this story gets under your skin, goes straight to your heart, and buries itself deep."
Normal People,1,"Both Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal are compelling here: the long gaps in their conversations crackling with complicated and unresolved emotions; sudden, surprising smiles making you catch your breath."
Normal People,1,Bear with it and you will not be disappointed as the world director Lenny Abrahamson and his fellow producers create is just as compelling as its two leads.
Normal People,1,"The series is bolstered throughout by engaging performances from both Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who breathe life into a story that is hyper-focused on what's often left unsaid between two people."
Normal People,1,"To have it shown instead of told refreshes the story for those who already know it, and will surely help engage those who are alienated by such interior detailing."
Normal People,1,"Relative newcomers Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal star as Marianne and Connell, and their chemistry is not only palpable, but captivating to watch."
Normal People,1,It is a beautiful piece of work capturing the fervid intensity of a first teenage sexual relationship with charm and poignancy.
Normal People,0,"If ""Normal People"" seeks to impart a lesson to its audience, it is this: Always forgive people who never change."
Normal People,1,"By keeping the camera tight, director Lenny Abrahamson allows us to see every emotion, perfectly capturing the intensity of youthful love."
Normal People,0,"The beauty of the novel is that so much between its protagonists is left unsaid, but perhaps it might have been better if the BBC had left the literary version of Normal People to speak for itself."
Normal People,1,"The show finds emotional power in its finely modulated lead performances, which have ample room to unfold. The effects are sneaky, cumulative, dependent on your willingness to agonize with the characters across four years and a series of sloppy partings."
Normal People,1,"Normal People is beautiful. It sweeps you up in its arms, capturing the very essence of the book ."
Normal People,1,"The 12-episode adaptation... is so faithful to the letter of the novel (Rooney co-wrote the first six scripts) that it winds up being different in spirit-swoonier, not that swoony is a bad thing."
Normal People,1,"Normal People is beautifully acted, atmospheric and sharply detailed. Six whole hours, though, feels like a stretch."
Normal People,1,"Hulu's Normal People is a vivid and intimate look at young, messy love, anchored by two powerfully vulnerable performances."
Normal People,1,Normal People will punch you in the gut just as much as it embraces you in a hug.
Normal People,1,"Matching the compulsive page-turning quality of Rooney's novel, this 12-part TV romance is anything but normal."
Normal People,1,"The two young leads are suberb; Mescal in particular is a revelation and gives a rich, thoughtful performance, particularly in some very intimate scenes."
Normal People,1,"With its trifecta of elegant writing, directing, and acting, Hulu's Normal People is just as bleak and uncompromising as Rooney's novel -- a feat, and one that takes several episodes to fully absorb."
Normal People,1,"Normal People is not the second coming of Dawson's Creek... But there's a sweet, silly soapiness to this show that makes it all the more appealing to get lost in."
Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae."
Normal People,1,"""Normal People"" could be the first work in Rooney's ""Before"" trilogy, another epic and intimate romance built around an undeniable, impractical spark. After all, it may have been done before, but it hasn't been told like this."
Normal People,1,"Of the show's two young stars, much is asked, and even more is given. They are spectacular -- apart, but especially together -- at conveying the vulnerability and longing essential to making a love story like this work."
Normal People,1,"The adaptation would always live or die by the casting of the leads... Happily, they are unassailable. Edgar-Jones and Mescal inhabit Marianne and Connell so utterly that it is instantly impossible to imagine them being played by anyone else."
Normal People,0,"Beyond illustrating the angst of their mutual attraction with a thousand penetrating angles, Normal People's TV adaptation fails as both an adaptation and as a standalone show. Without the details of the book, the story is featureless erotica."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"So far, its final season is very funny, and its certainly rewarding for longtime fans. Most importantly, its also growing, changing, and asking tough questions about its own premise up until the very last moment."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"With one last caper, the wacky precinct that stole our hearts and tickled our funny bones signed off after eight seasons on two networks. As Jake would say: Noice."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"This final season is an awkward combination of tones, as it aims to be both insightful and funny and ends up being neither."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"It was a warm-hearted, densely crafted comedy that was one of the networks' last decent originals. Fortunately, the two-part finale did the series justice, and you should check it out if you were ever a fan."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"""The Last Day"" is far from Brooklyn Nine-Nine's finest hour, but it deserves credit for checking off every series finale box while telling a fun story without going overboard on saccharine material."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"For a show that has always been enviably confident in its comedic tone, the start of Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 8 falters, but not without showing its potential."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,It somehow manages to be topical and ridiculous; on-trend and off-kilter.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"""The Last Day"" really was the perfect goodbye."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,There can only be so many twists and turns with only a couple of episodes left before the series finale.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"It's really a very well-constructed hour of television, always moving with a momentum that a lot of this season lacked."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Season 8 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine wasn't the triumphant victory lap that it should have been, but ""The Last Day"" absolutely sends off our favorite precinct with grace, humor, and heart."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Ultimately, the series finale delivered on everything we've come to expect from Brooklyn Nine-Nine: plenty of humor, plenty of heart, and a soulful and satisfying farewell to a warm and wonderful series. NINE-NINE!"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,The final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine came with intense pressure to deliver humor while also reflecting the changed world it inhabits.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine signs off with a season that feels contrived in places, but reminds us about everything that made it so widely loved."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"There's not a lot of runway left before the end of the series but if anyone is able to thoughtfully balance the big questions with the demands of a weekly comedy, it's going to be the Brooklyn Nine-Nine writers."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,[Provides] a parade of comedy while also leaning into serious socio-political issues. It deftly navigates this tricky balance all while making sure each character remains true to their own personalities and motivations.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"With all your material under scrutiny, what exactly can you do? It's a question the Nine-Nine is still looking to answer for themselves, and that's okay."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Everything people still adore about the show remains intact, particularly in a subplot involving Sergeant Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero) diving into her fear that her strange, geeky chemistry with Holt is off."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"I don't want to applaud the show for doing the right thing, but more so for ditching the work they'd done thus far in favor of a story that really examines the police and its role in society."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"While culturally relevant, ""The Good Ones"" and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's approach to what's going on in the world kind of implode upon themself, thanks to the previous seven seasons of the series."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine does the best job possible of acknowledging the problem with portraying cops as uncomplicated heroes while still remaining a good-natured, funny show, but it feels fitting, and fortunate, that this is its final season."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"These episodes are just as joke-dense and fun as their funniest pre-Season 8 episodes have been, everyone from the main cast down to the guest stars putting in their full 9-9%."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"Nine-Nine's final season occasionally feels like one big hedged bet, banking on its audience's love for its characters to get them through one last batch of good-natured adventures. That's the kicker: even through these pains, the show is still fun."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"""Nine-Nine"" goes out on a semi-serious note, and for the most part, effectively."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,"It's a testament to Goor, the writers, and the cast that they didn't take the easy way out, and that they still find so much humor in difficult circumstances."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1,I'm happy that a sitcom that's delivered so many hard laughs over the years has had the chance to go out on its own terms - nudging its audience toward a greater awareness of what other cop shows are trying to sell in the process.
Legion,1,"With three seasons and barely 30 episodes, Legion was nothing if not a feat of visual artistry, a meditation on the human mind that necessitated engaging our own in order to participate."
Legion,1,"It's a marvel just how ambitious this series is, and how it so expertly weaves between disparate character and story arcs while still feeling polished."
Legion,1,"A zany, well stylized and brilliantly shot series as we've come to expect, but I have to say the ending was a little anti-climactic..."
Legion,1,Legion wasn't ever going to be a show with a traditional happy ending. But maybe this is as close as it gets.
Legion,1,"Season Two wandered aimlessly until not even the pretty pictures were enough to justify the muddled storytelling. This third and final season mostly returned to that original, effective balance."
Legion,1,"As always, Legion is dazzling on a visual level. It plays with frame ratio, color, mood, tone, and sound with wild abandon. This season gave us entrancing sequences."
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Legion,1,Legion's third season premiere is as quirky and whimsical as you want it to be.
Legion,1,"If this first episode is any indication, we are in for a wild ride during the final season of FX's Legion."
Legion,1,"If you've jumped off the ride at some point over the past two years, do yourself a favour and hop back on the merry-go-round for this final season of Legion."
Legion,1,"In a more just world, Legion would be the stuff of conversations at water coolers, or wherever people gather to discuss the amazing these days."
Legion,1,"Its final season premiere advances the plot while swimming in pure psychedelia. Trippy but not senseless... the real fun is in deciphering the plot puzzles, verbal games and visual clues as the storyline hurtles towards finally doing some time travel."
Legion,1,"The loopy digressions are as vivid as ever... But there's also solid character development, inventive depictions of mutant powers, a delightful bit of mime from Bill Irwin and at least one genuine narrative surprise."
Legion,0,"PowerPoint surrealism hiding a total lack of imagination. Deaths don't matter, as the timeline fractures across illusions and flashbacks. There's yet another toothy shadow monster. David's face appears on lunchboxes: Mmmm, yessss, ironic merchandise."
Legion,1,"I know Legion has never been afraid to get silly, but I laughed every single time the tactical assault team pulled out a giant hook to grab that guy. Every. Single. Time."
Legion,1,"The third season of ""Legion"" is one of those experiences where even after two stellar seasons you cannot believe [Noah] Hawley and his colleagues have the guts to try and pull off one unexpected moment after another."
Legion,1,"There are enough hallucinogenic thrills in Legion's third season to keep the rest of it from falling apart, even as time travel threatens to force the characters to do that very thing."
Legion,1,"[Noah] Hawley's faithfulness to being as weird and infuriating as possible until the end is admirable. And when it's working, as it does so often throughout season 3, it's easy to get swept up in the freewheeling creativity of it all."
Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.
Legion,1,"Legion proves that a more out-of-the-box approach to aesthetic, narrative, and perspective can offer so much more, and that superpowers don't always mean muscles."
Legion,1,Legion remains an intoxicating experience laced with a grand sense of wonder. The humorous touches are every bit as clever as the visual treats. The performances are every bit as compelling as the production team's command of the narrative.
Legion,1,"Even if ""Legion"" isn't the sum of its parts, some of those parts are spectacular on their own."
Legion,1,"If nothing else, the final season feels primed to anchor its lofty visual aspirations with a story that may well satisfy those who enjoy the show for what it is, and those who are hungry for a meatier story."
Legion,1,"Legion is quite possibly the most beautiful show on television, with stunning visuals giving the eyes plenty to digest while leaving the mind dazzled and bewildered."
Legion,1,"Legion uses visuals, editing, music and sound better than almost any series on television. And I don't just mean any series now -- I mean ever."
Legion,1,"There's an unmistakable creative energy about each episode of the third season, as if Hawley, his writing staff and collection of directors all gathered around and said, ""Let's go out on fire."""
Legion,1,"The show's third and final season is a visual achievement, typified by imaginative flights of absurdism."
Justified,1,"For six seasons, Justified has consistently been one of the best shows on television."
Justified,1,"A pitch-perfect ending to one of TV's best, often-overlooked dramas."
Justified,1,Justified called it quits and went out with a finale that was as unpredictable and poetic and entertaining and memorable as the series itself. What a triumph.
Justified,1,"... there's nothing predictable about the direction of the story or the characters, who are layered in levels of loyalty and honor and self-interest."
Justified,1,"Somehow, over six seasons, the show's producers have retained the style and attitude of their source material to craft a smart, engaging modern day Western that feels classic as a John Wayne shoot 'em up and modern as the next season of True Detective."
Justified,1,"Justified's soul rests not in its heart, but at its hip, right next to the gun holster."
Justified,1,"As much as I liked Olyphant in Deadwood, it's hard to think of him as anyone but Raylan."
Justified,1,"We know Raylan can't remain a good boy for very long. Indeed, we count upon his random acts of violent justice, just as we are made eager for Boyd's random acts of violent retribution, to give the show its juice."
Justified,1,"From the way season 6 begins, it looks like Justified is going out with a bang."
Justified,1,"The neo-Western's end is here at last, and the guns are mostly blazing."
Justified,1,It is emphatically a show to relish.
Justified,1,"The final season is primed to explore what the end means for Raylan, Boyd, and Ava, and whether or not the good days are truly gone forever."
Justified,1,There's a definite sense that the show is consciously returning to its core strengths.
Justified,1,"Although the program isn't as showy or heralded as the network's other dramas, its sixth-season start reinforces a sense that Justified will be sorely missed when it rides into the sunset."
Justified,1,"It's interesting to see just how self-aware the premiere episode is with all the talk of Harlan practically a remnant of what it used to be, of moments in the past and the recognition of things all wrapping up."
Justified,1,"Justified's love of the wacky short-story character ... has made it funnier and less self-serious than other superficially similar antihero shows, but it has also made it dunderheaded."
Justified,1,"Justified is again fun and scary and thrilling -- in some ways more, because both the show and the people on it know how little time they have left."
Justified,1,"A smart show knows when to quit, and sometimes after making the decision to quit, it finds itself again."
Justified,1,"We will know for sure in 12 weeks, but we sure are off to a good start."
Justified,1,"Raylan vs. Boyd begins, as the electric first hour of Justified's final season proves that the only thing deadlier than the present is getting lost in the past."
Justified,1,"The greatest compliment I can pay Justified is to say that, despite the fact that it arrived at the height of the anti-hero boom, it never felt like a copycat. The drama created a vibrant, funny, tragic world of its own."
Justified,1,There must be an alternate universe where Justified is fully recognized for what it is: one of the greatest shows in television history.
Justified,1,"Elmore Leonard loved this series based on his novella ""Fire in the Hole,"" and Justified does him proud to the end."
Justified,1,"With ""Fate,"" as usual, the best stuff with Justified is often the little stuff: a stray word of dialogue, an Olyphant glance from under the shadow of that Stetson Marshall hat, Goggins' hair. Oh yes, the hair."
Justified,1,One of the great things about this noir-western hybrid is its interest in updating more than just the superficial tropes of those genres.
Prison Break,1,This season promises plenty of action in some real-world parallels...
Prison Break,1,"I was fascinated the entire time and thought there were a great amount of plot twists. There was a character for everyone. No one was quite like the other, which definitely added to the beauty of this show."
Prison Break,0,"My hope is that this will satisfy whatever itch the show's die-hards had to elicit this revival, if only to finally put an end to all of this."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
Prison Break,1,"Moving the action to Yemen and a city thrown into chaos by ISIL made the show relevant, if not far-fetched. You do wonder how far realistically Lincoln would get in his search, but you care enough about the characters to let it slide."
Prison Break,1,"For a 45-minute blast of nostalgia or a bit of (literal) escapism, Prison Break does the job. Just make sure you've suspended your disbelief before you watch."
Prison Break,1,Solid series revival is true to the original crime story.
Prison Break,1,"Prison Break in a nutshell: It's ridiculous, it makes no sense, but it's watchable because you need to find out answers."
Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is a very special roller coaster ride that lives by its own rules, and not much seems to have changed from the franchise's later seasons. That's a good thing for fans of the original, but for everyone else? I'm not sure."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels."
Prison Break,0,"Prison Break isn't worth much of anything, but it could have been. You can see the better show trying to escape its lock-up of bad ideas."
Prison Break,1,"But while TV in general has changed, Prison Break really hasn't, as seen in tonight's season premiere. Billed as an event series, the show remains true to its goofy nature, with just a few surprises thrown into the mix."
Prison Break,1,"The show is as fast-moving as ever, with a trio that includes Sucre and C-Note all heading to super-dangerous Yemen to plan another big breakout as promised in the title."
Prison Break,0,"The question remains: Other than an effort to goose ratings with the return of a familiar title, is there really any creative reason for more Prison Break? Probably not."
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
Prison Break,0,"It's utter nonsense. Mind-numbingly stupid. Worse yet, it's a bore."
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level."
Prison Break,0,"This show was junk food, and proud of it. That's what makes Prison Break's return as a nine-episode miniseries so baffling: Now, the show wants to mean something. And it's horrible."
Prison Break,0,"Fox's revival, alas, begins with a flawed blueprint, while suffering from a been-there, broke-out-of-that quality."
Prison Break,0,"In a particularly generous (or perverse) move, Fox is giving us not just a dead show or a dead character, but a two-for-one sale."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
Prison Break,1,"With the action going from 0 to 80 m.p.h. about 10 minutes into the premiere, this Prison Break wants to recapture its old urgency -- and some of its old fans will likely stick around for the ride."
Prison Break,1,It may take a little while to get going but trust me; it's worth the wait. By the end you'll be wishing you could binge watch the whole season on Netflix.
Prison Break,1,"At its best, Prison Break is kind of the Fast & Furious of episodic television -- not taking itself too seriously and providing equal amounts of crazy plot twists, action sequences and cheesy dialogue."
Prison Break,1,"Although the Prison Break revival came close several times to self-parody, the reunion of Lincoln, Michael, Sara, and the rest of the original characters had enough power to carry the show through its sillier moments."
Prison Break,1,"Some whoppers in terms of story and logic, but this is the long-awaited fifth season of Prison Break, after all. You expected otherwise? A solid start."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
Prison Break,1,"A strong start to Prison Break's long overdue revival, if the show stays this enjoyable, fans are in for a real treat."
Prison Break,1,"After seeing all the badass brawls and jaw-dropping shocks that happen in the early part of the season, I'd have to be behind bars to stop from watching everything else that happens. I need answers as badly as Linc does."
Prison Break,1,"After a crackling good start, Prison Break begins to wobble but doesn't quite topple in succeeding hours."
Prison Break,1,"Everyone from the writers to the actors committed to the outlandish nature of the show's later years, and this is where the newest run of episodes squarely lives... and unlike The X-Files, this conspiracy is fun to watch."
Prison Break,1,"Prison Break is at its best when it's an escapist jaunt graced with a few characters and relationships with energy and texture, but the drama finds it quite difficult to establish that groove this time out."
Community,1,Community is unique. There has never been a sitcom quite like it.
Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it."
Community,1,"There's no denying that the magic of the early seasons isn't quite there. However, let's be very clear about this: There is much greatness and joy to be found in those 13 episodes."
Community,1,"It's meta, but one of the best things about Community is how it finds sincere emotion lurking in its self-deconstructive rabbitholes."
Community,1,"There's no obvious evidence of budget cuts in the move to Yahoo, so consider this a positive start for the latest version of Community."
Community,1,"It looks mighty twee on the page, but as Community fans know, Mr. Harmon has a knack for turning countercultural whimsicality into affecting, fast-paced comedy. He pulls it off again."
Community,1,"Really, they're just great excuses for fans to geek out on what they love most about Community, from the endless stream of nostalgic pop culture references to the clever inside jokes about the show itself."
Community,1,"The spirit largely remains intact: Specifically, the world is mad. So is Greendale. So is Dan Harmon. Did I say I love Paget Brewster? I do. And the refurbished, reborn, reconstituted, regenerated, re-undead Community? That too."
Community,1,"For all intents and purposes, this technologically resurrected Community still feels like Community, just, you know, a little different."
Community,1,"The series feels truly smaller for the first time... That said, the extra time allows for funny gags to go on longer as well."
Community,1,"A fitting farewell for the folks of Greendale, as the entire series perfectly collapsed in on itself in a glorious, hilarious, and bittersweet fashion."
Community,1,"Good show, Yahoo."
Community,1,"Like the Greendale Seven themselves, our time at Community college may not have seemed like the complete fulfillment of Dan Harmon's dream, but an invaluable experience that brought such unlikely friends together."
Community,1,"For the fourth time now we've got what essentially equals a series finale, and for perhaps the first time it satisfies."
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
Community,1,Don't write-off the new season in the age of Yahoo
Community,1,"Community continues to achieve a tricky balance of cynicism, sentiment and surreality."
Community,1,"Ah, Greendale, how we would have missed you!"
Community,1,"Though it will never be quite whole again, I'm happy Community is back."
Community,1,"The Yahoo version of Community seems rather scaled-down, budget-wise, and looser and less urgent than NBC seasons (running times vary). But it still feels, moves, and thinks like the Community you know."
Community,1,"Welcome back, Community. Even on Yahoo, you're still the best sitcom on network television."
Community,1,"Community loves nothing more than pushing back against traditional industry standards, an impulse that shows no sign of abating in this strange sixth season."
Community,1,"Brewster is a versatile comic actress with a great feel for blasts of absurdity, and she quickly proves to be a great fit for Community's tendency to whip back and forth between banter comedy and straight-up foolishness."
Community,1,"It feels familiar and fresh, with myriad possibilities in front of it thanks to smart new cast additions and a renewed focus on those characters over just getting lost in the creatively inane."
Community,0,"Diehard fans will probably still find much to enjoy, but I'm inclined to think it's time for everybody to graduate from Greendale Community College, and get on with their lives."
Community,1,"It might not be exactly the same, but it's still better than most shows in its genre are."
Community,1,Community is a niche taste; it makes sense that it has found a home on the internet where those that love it can enjoy it and those that don't can forget about it.
Community,1,"These episodes are not their finest half-hours, but they're laying a foundation for greater things to come."
Community,1,"Fans have spent years arguing that some Community is better than none at all, and more than any other season, this one puts that notion to the test."
Community,1,"The cast is missing a couple of familiar faces, but judging from the first new episode, ""Ladders,"" the meta-jokes and movie-trope uses are back in full force."
Community,1,"Shows get older. It happens. That said, I laughed, I was happy to see Abed and Britta and everyone else, and I'm hopeful that the newbies will become as quickly assimilated into the group as Buzz and Duncan were last season."
Community,1,This is a show constantly in the process of becoming something else.
Community,1,"Whatever doubts you've had about the changes, Community has already pre-doubted them. But the first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does."
Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.
Community,1,"Be assured that, as Frankie says of Greendale, this new funky version of Community is ""weird, passionate, and gross."" But, you know, gleefully gross."
Community,1,"The heart remains the same. If you loved it before, you'll still love it."
Community,1,"In its sixth season, Community remains a witty and wonderful oddity, and now that it's found a supportive new home in Yahoo, the show's creative future seems bright."
Modern Family,0,"Overall, though, it felt a bit dutiful. As though the cast, much like the characters, knew that it had become a bit too claustrophobic, but still weren't wholly sure they had the guts to go."
Modern Family,1,"As the last few minutes of the finale ticked away, I remained surprisingly uplifted, even amidst their tear-jerking hugs."
Modern Family,1,"The poignant drama is lightened by a sprinkling of silly comedic detours, which are funny enough but also a reminder this show has reached its natural conclusion."
Modern Family,1,"Modern Family never stopped being funny, and the finale was comfortingly consistent with the series as a whole: A snappy, smart, and unabashedly sentimental celebration of the folks we love (and sometimes hate) the most."
Modern Family,1,"It was, all in all, a warm, sweet way to end the show, with some smiling-through-tears, some laughs, and a lot of affection."
Modern Family,1,"The hour-long finale hits every familiar ""Modern Family"" note just right."
Modern Family,1,"The writers had some work to do in terms of pulling it all together, offering a finale that was worthy of the show's mix of big, broad laughs and tender, family-oriented heart. For the most part, the show delivered just that."
Modern Family,0,"The show should've ended years ago, when it was better equipped to tie together all these subplots, characters, and themes. Now, we're left with an ending that doesn't really want to be an ending."
Modern Family,1,"In a world gone soft while praising so much mediocrity, I found it interesting when viewers went out of their way to complain that ""Modern Family"" had lost its magic. It never really did."
Modern Family,0,"The two-part series finale they delivered Wednesday night had the right idea - breaking up the extended family, a gentle goodbye to this stage of things - but the execution was quite uninspired."
Modern Family,1,"Modern Family encourages us to love one another, and celebrate our differences. It was a great show, and it will be missed."
Modern Family,1,"The show capably, often hilariously, interwove storylines about three connected families that were all part of a larger extended family."
Modern Family,1,"We get all 15 family members seated at the same dinner table, and it is glooooooorious."
Modern Family,1,"For both better and worse, Modern Family seems to have embraced its age, settling into a more familiar approach to its comedy and storytelling."
The Split,1,"It might be thought women watch The Split to pick up divorce tips. Not true. We watch for the fabulous homes and the handbags, and if there’s some unhappiness along the way, so be it."
The Split,1,"Bring on more secrets and lies. And, by the way, Christie’s back in town."
Line of Duty,1,[Might] be beyond its best years but it is still at times the most thrilling thing on TV.
Line of Duty,1,"[The premiere] might have represented an unusually slow trundle to the top of the ride. Yet now that we've got there, the ride itself looks like giving us our money's worth again."
Line of Duty,1,"Here's hoping for more characters like Hastings, Bartlet and McCall based on the knowledge that television can shape our values and behavior as well as simply reflect them."
Line of Duty,1,That quick pace is the show's secret weapon.
Line of Duty,1,Continues the formula that has been successful for almost a decade.
Line of Duty,1,"Total catnip for the thinking mystery lover, all about illusion, reality and the search for truth."
Line of Duty,1,"Its ever-rotating cast of guest stars has always been one of Line Of Duty's greatest strengths, and within two short hours, Kelly Macdonald is already shaping up to be one of the most mad and memorable."
Line of Duty,1,"Series six indulged its audience to an insane degree, continually throwing the ball for us as we joyfully ran and fetched, ran and fetched, saliva and madcap theories flying."
Line of Duty,1,"I've griped about various bits of this show over the years - the jargon, the references to people and places we'd completely forgotten about... but it stands head and shoulders above most other dramas."
Line of Duty,1,"But in the last few episodes of Line of Duty and particularly the finale, containing a supposedly towering speech by Hastings so pedestrian that even Dunbar could barely sell it, the message has hardly been moulded at all. I"
Line of Duty,1,"Line of Duty, with its plot twists and its tendency for things that happened years ago to suddenly become relevant once again, feels perfect for the sort of unhinged theorising on which second screening thrives."
Line of Duty,1,The casting of Macdonald is another masterstroke in a series that has never been short of them -- her performance is nothing short of sublime.
Line of Duty,0,"There is great potential here but last night's episode was at times impenetrable, as if taking our loyalties for granted. If I had been watching for the first time I might have switched off."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Line of Duty,1,"I have hopes for Macdonald as the most intriguing villain yet. The acting, the facial hints of a double, if not triple, life, subtle, that ageless face able to morph from tender to slab-cold cruel within an eyebrow."
Line of Duty,1,"All the acronyms have reached the point where they seem self-parodying... However, I am compelled to keep going."
Line of Duty,1,"Newbies to Duty may find it takes a little while to learn the lingo, but persevere, and you'll find cracking drama amongst the seemingly scrupulous attention to detail."
Line of Duty,1,"Line of Duty has been a smash for lots of reasons. The tight as a tourniquet plotting. The sensational twists. The slick editing. But at its heart are the three main characters, the little family against the machine."
Line of Duty,0,"As we embark on series six, a far greater problem is the weight of the past. As the plot races on, names and events float to the surface of my consciousness like something disturbing in a canal."
Line of Duty,1,"The first episode of series six returns to what Line of Duty does best: dodgy coppers, tense action and characters who communicate almost exclusively in acronyms."
Line of Duty,1,"In the best way, it recalled the first episode of the show's superlative second series: could Macdonald's intriguing, softly-spoken Davidson become an anti-hero to rival Keeley Hawes' Lindsay Denton?"
Line of Duty,1,"Labyrinthine plotting aside, it's LoD's characterisations that fuel its murky allure. Nobody is squeaky clean or unambiguous."
Mr Inbetween,1,"Ryan's writing is crisp and taut - there's no sense that like many writers working in the crime genre he is learning what the story is as he is telling it, that breadcrumbs are leading him along. He is as abrupt and obdurate as his leading man."
Mr Inbetween,1,"Ryan's marvelous performance provides the glue that holds everything together. His character is a callous killer for hire, but, without smoothing out any of the rough edges, the actor makes you care about him"
Mr. Bean,1,Mr. Atkinson has the essential comic gift for making the entirely implausible seem thoroughly normal.
Mr. Bean,1,That was Mr Bean's charm -- it made the most mundane events unexpectedly amusing.
Mr. Bean,1,Episodes never feel overly-milked or padded.
Mr. Bean,1,"What makes this show particularly noteworthy is that aside from rare repeat appearances of secondary characters, like girlfriend Irma Gobb...Atkinson successfully carries the show himself with little use of the spoken word."
Mr. Bean,1,"Mr. Bean is an almost silent character, so it's impressive that he's made such an impact on society."
Preacher,1,"Had the showrunners elected to call this series by a different name it may have been a modest hit or a cult classic. Instead, AMC's Preacher is a series that just shares a title with an iconic comic book. This is not the Preacher we deserved."
Preacher,0,The back half of Preacher will have to pull a miracle out of the bag for this not to be remembered as a disappointment and a missed opportunity.
Preacher,1,"Few television shows acknowledge the bitter things in life with such imaginative humor, and few characters face this kind of cynicism with the two-fisted grace of Tulip O'Hare."
Preacher,1,"Hopefully, Preacher will wrap up successfully, and keep on finding new ways to offend as many people as possible. But the feeling is certainly that it's time to let the show go. The end? It's arriving just in time, almost."
Preacher,1,"Preacher exists at the fringes of Golden Age television: erudite, boundary-pushing but also bloody, profane, and decidedly niche."
Preacher,0,"This has always been the thing with Preacher, from the source material on. It has plenty to say about humanity & faith & life, but to hear it you have to live through the juvenilia. With Season 4, though, for the first time, that does not feel worth it."
Preacher,1,"One of the things that makes Preacher so much fun is its over-the-top lunacy, and the season premiere did not disappoint."
Preacher,1,"Whether or not Preacher will adhere precisely to Ennis's original ending remains to be seen, but there's reason enough to continue watching to find out."
Preacher,1,"Without a doubt, Preacher is back, and along with it, some of the most creatively and hilariously violent sequences on television."
Preacher,1,"The final season is as delightfully demented as ever, with the added urgency of its finale giving it the necessary narrative momentum it always needed."
Preacher,0,"Preacher Season 4 starts strong, but it can't escape the snare of mediocrity, no matter how much craziness it throws our way. And while the show is rarely subjectively bad, it continues to have issues with tone and characterizations."
Hannibal,1,"This is a wonderful, beautiful, and captivating plummet into madness."
Hannibal,1,"'Twas the most deliciously warped love letter ever written by a horrifically, beautiful mind."
Hannibal,1,"Thanks to some sharp dialogue pleated with myriad meanings, Mikkelsen and Anderson enthrall just as much as the show's usual histrionic, CGI-addled murder-as-performance-art setpieces."
Hannibal,1,"It might as well be on the silver screen at a film festival for the level of auteuritsm on display. If you aren't watching, you're missing out."
Hannibal,1,The degree to which Hannibal is willing to withhold answers and meaning while still managing to present a thoroughly engrossing show from week-to-week is refreshing.
Hannibal,1,"Maybe it was too weird, maybe it was too gruesome. But it was, all puns intended, bloody good."
Hannibal,1,"If Hannibal wasn't already too cerebral for the average horror fan, it may have accidentally stumbled into the muck of pretension... But despite the audience-building challenges Fuller sometimes throws in the path of his monster, it's hard to hate him."
Hannibal,1,"This last run of episodes has been exceptional, adapting Harris's Red Dragon novel with Fuller's distinctive visual flair, and making even the most familiar elements of the Lecter universe feel inspired again."
Hannibal,1,"Its boldest, most ambitious, and most novelistic [season] yet, though it runs the risk of becoming too caught up in its own aesthetic."
Hannibal,1,"In this, Hannibal remains beautifully consistent as one of the most poetic shows on television."
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal has been capable of the best and also of touching the worst. It would be excessive, but blessed madness Hannibal's. [Fresh Review in Spanish]"
Hannibal,1,"From the European-flavored surrealist horror of the first half of the season to the slow-simmering brutality of the back half, Bryan Fuller has not only expertly crafted the perfect ending, but also one of the greatest love stories of contemporary TV."
Hannibal,1,"Making a near-narrative reinvention look effortless, and expanding its visual vocabulary into ever-more imaginative flourishes, Hannibal's third outing secures its place as network television's greatest current triumph."
Hannibal,1,Hannibal's audience must also juggle tough questions along with macabre and stunning imagery.
Hannibal,1,It was a delicious episode.
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal remains a show that flirts dangerously with being very silly, however it struts about with such devil-may-care panache that it gets away with pretty much everything it wants to."
Hannibal,1,"No series, Twin Peaks included, has quite managed to be as deadly serious but also as winkingly ludicrous, so that you can't easily separate one mode of presentation from the other."
Hannibal,1,"It's possible, of course, that I love the show because it confirms my worst suspicions about food culture."
Hannibal,1,"After two years in the role, Mikkelsen has outgrown the Anthony Hopkins film portrayal and made this charismatic monster his own."
Hannibal,1,"Here at the start of season 3, the many references to Dr. Lecter as the devil take on a new quality, given the fact that, for the first time since the series began, we are treated to a Hannibal Lecter who seems far more human than ever before."
Hannibal,1,"While I'm as anxious as everyone else to see what happened to Will and the others, Hannibal himself remains a fascinating character and even without Will physically being there, his presence was felt."
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal begins its third season in a fog, but eventually makes this much clear: We know how this story ends, but the journey to that destination can still be bloody fun."
Hannibal,1,"Bonsoir, Hannibal. I missed you."
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal Season 3 didn't exactly start of with a bang as it did last year, but I'm intrigued enough by what we were shown (and what we weren't shown) to have enjoyed the premiere fully."
Hannibal,1,Knowing that we can safely root for Will makes it so much easier to plug into Hannibal.
Hannibal,1,"The killers on Hannibal are far less interested in slaking violent urges than they are in producing beautifully destroyed corpses, and generating a kind of public art."
Hannibal,1,I am just enthusiastic to have Hannibal back in my life-disconcerting nightmares and all.
Hannibal,1,The precise and surgical control Hannibal has always exercised is starting to unravel and it's exciting to see how his downfall eventually unfolds.
Hannibal,1,Hannibal uses its source materials in a way that creates a wholly new work that still feels like the original.
Hannibal,1,Hannibal drips with style... it's in that disturbing beauty that the show finds its visceral and intellectual power...
Hannibal,1,It is a magnificently macabre drama that looks and feels like absolutely nothing else on TV.
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Hannibal,1,"The best TV show of last year is finally back for Season 3 and, judging by the first three installments, it hasn't lost a step."
Hannibal,1,"The meal being served is different, but the chef remains the same. And viewers need not fear what Hannibal cooks up next."
Hannibal,1,"Even the uncorking of a champagne bottle takes on a shriekingly nightmarish aspect in Hannibal, which in its third macabre season magnifies every succulent and sinister image and sound to its creepiest, ickiest potential."
Hannibal,1,"Fuller takes pleasure in marrying the beauty of the imagery with the grotesquerie of the dramatic irony. In essence, like all outstanding art house directors, he has a sense of humor."
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal is so exquisitely rendered that it's sometimes easy to forget what you're actually watching, at least until an artery opens and blood streams freely and artfully across the screen."
Hannibal,1,"Where other TV shows avoid the weight of all that death, Hannibal turns the horror into opera - bold and beautiful and over-the-top and opulent."
Hannibal,1,"When you are in with Hannibal Lecter, you are in a waking nightmare, where everything seems like it should exist only in the darkest corners of imagination, but is instead somehow horrifyingly real."
Hannibal,1,Hannibal is the most radical enterprise on network television right now.
Hannibal,1,"On every level, Bryan Fuller and the team behind Hannibal are elevating what we should expect from network television."
Hannibal,1,This new season of Hannibal shows early signs of being the show's best yet -- and that's a pretty big accomplishment.
Hannibal,1,Season three of Hannibal offers a thrilling feast of visual and auditory delights.
Hannibal,1,"Hannibal enthralls the viewer's aesthetic sense with its stunning photography, sophisticated use of imagery, and breathtaking beauty while at the same time threatening to steal away our soul, dragging it deep into the void."
Hannibal,1,"The lean, mean and violently keen third season of Hannibal continues to break the rules and look good doing it."
Hannibal,1,"Regardless of how far the series pushed the envelope in seasons one and two, it goes to a whole new level in season three."
Hannibal,1,"Now in its third season, Hannibal remains the most engrossing (and gross) serial-killer drama on television, and the most beautiful."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"""Last Forever"" brought up the idea of true love versus soul mates, and a bit about fate, but if I wanted to watch a series about how your soulmate might not be the love of your life, I'd have watched Dawson's Creek, a series which did it much better."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Lest you think How I Met Your Mother was going to skip over the good parts of Ted and The Mother's relationship, Monday night's episode delivered another milestone in their romance."
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
How I Met Your Mother,1,"All told, the finale, like the series itself, was fine, if not, alas, legendary. But hey, unlike some of the shows that have come and gone while Ted searched for his dream girl, it certainly beat a slap to the face."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"For some, [the] surprise was a disappointment. But disappointment is expecting that a life has only one love story, that happily ever after only happens once, that surprises, good and bad, happen along the way."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Fortunately for HIMYM, the time-turning precedent for the season only strengthens such a radical episode's premise."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"This isn't a perfect ending... But a straightforward, fairytale ending for Ted and Tracy wouldn't have served viewers, and it would have been beyond boring."
How I Met Your Mother,1,'Last Forever' was actually a really great finale episode overall.
How I Met Your Mother,1,"I wish I was as thrilled by the ending as the beginning, but I'm grateful that so many episodes stand up to multiple, multiple viewings."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The result of [the writers'] plan was among the more maddening things I've seen in the finale of a show I at one point loved.
How I Met Your Mother,0,"In spite of a couple of lovely moments, the ""HIMYM"" finale was a terrible miscalculation."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The ultimate takeaway from the final season is that series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were at once too good and not good enough to tell the story they ultimately wanted to tell.
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Here's to hoping the final eight episodes will continue to make [the Mother] invaluable to the show's story. After all, she's the reason How I Met Your Mother is great again."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Monday night's ""The Lighthouse"" was a real beacon of hope for fans... because for the first time since the pilot, we saw The Mother and Ted together. And what's more, this shared moment was a super special one."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Nothing was over-the-top funny, but it was a perfect combination of laughter and sweet moments that really do make up for all of the lackluster episodes in the past few seasons."
How I Met Your Mother,1,I loved the way the two future friends met. Ted's wife definitely would be someone who would ask if a fellow passenger was okay after seeing her distraught. I also liked how she tried to lighten the mood by joking about the cookies.
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Move over Zooey Deschanel, there's a new adorkable girl in town and her name is... well, we actually don't know her name just yet, but for the sake of avoiding confusion, we'll just call her the ""Mother""."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"I'm hoping for some good character moments, some fun glimpses into the past and future, and a sense of the sweetness and humanity that the show had mostly lost in its later years. On that level, ""The Locket"" and ""Coming Back"" was an encouraging start."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"Me? I'm confident. I'm a total story-structure geek, and that's one of the reasons I love this show."
How I Met Your Mother,1,"It's to early to say if the rest of the season 9 episodes will be as good, but it's always great when a show can start off strong."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,"The characters stay dumb, but the show just gets smarter and smarter, and television as a medium is better for it."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a welcome return to the airwaves in all of its profane glory.
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,"Season 15 of It's Always Sunny shows no sign of this now record-breaking show slowing down, as it continues its reign as one of the most ingenious, unexpected, and uproarious series of the 21st century."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,"Here's to a glorious Season 15 double opener, and long may It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia reign. Much like Dennis, it hasn't even begun to peak."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,"That's also why we love the Reynolds. There's something human about being a dysfunctional mess, that will never go out of style."
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,1,"It's often as funny as ever, and the first six episodes of the 15th outing are built on the show's stunning confidence, never desperately going for a cheap joke and often producing a laugh from its unpredictable sensibility."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
Arrested Development,1,"It may not be all it once was, but even an imperfect Arrested Development is still funnier than many of the comedies on-air today."
Arrested Development,1,"These may not be smart people or even good people, but they belong together. As the title promises, it's fun as hell to see how far they've come without really going anywhere at all."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development ending, or approaching the finish line, is the best thing for all involved. It's just sad to see everything wrap up on a ""less-than"" note and in a way that, ultimately, doesn't feel much like Arrested Development."
Arrested Development,0,"Season five proved that Arrested Development could imitate its glory years, but the Bluths don't seem to have anything funny left to say."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Arrested Development,0,"What's missing here, to a depressing degree, is a sense of purpose."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
Arrested Development,1,"It's not as consistent as it was at its peak, but the rapid-fire jokes hit more than they miss. And who would complain about more time with the Bluths?"
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Arrested Development,0,Fine food never tastes as good when it is reheated a few days later. Arrested Development season five feels like reheated meat that smells way past its expiration date.
Arrested Development,1,"Ultimately, Arrested Development is now as dysfunctional as the dysfunctional family as its followed all along. And depending on your affection for these deeply broken people, your results with the show may vary."
Arrested Development,0,I wanted to laugh like never before. Voice of the narrator Ron Howard: I did not succeed. [Full Review in Spanish]
Arrested Development,0,"The Bluths are a terrible lot, and the show never lets us forget it, but there's something cruel, and boring, about continuing to harp on Buster's otherness."
Arrested Development,1,"Season five starts much more promisingly, with an energy that comes from reuniting most of the cast in a single episode again."
Arrested Development,0,"The narrative hand holding and frequent plot reminders built for weekly network TV grew tiresome when watching on the show's adopted home, Netflix."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development just needs to get over the stories it's already told, and move on to the ones it's telling this time around."
Arrested Development,1,"Instead of winking at you from afar, the meta-humor of the fifth season pulls you aside and points out all the jokes you should be enjoying. That's not to say that the fifth season isn't enjoyable... but it all feels a little dated..."
Arrested Development,1,"Just as whip-smart and insane as it used to be. Get ready for callbacks, incest storylines, and for Lucille...and Maeby...to steal the show."
Arrested Development,1,"Better than the fourth season -- which isn't saying much, admittedly -- with lots of pleasures, and some padding, too."
Arrested Development,1,"With a comedic cast this talented - together, they achieve banana-stand levels of reliability - there will always be good stuff."
Arrested Development,0,"The problem with evoking past highlights as a narrative device, however, is that it relies on an unsullied memory of what's being evoked."
Arrested Development,0,"But resurrecting all of the previous season's complicated plotlines in one episode comes with its own consequences. Check your lease, Netflixers, because you're living in Flashback City."
Arrested Development,1,"The new season is a success, but this is a banana stand that needs some new flavors fast."
Arrested Development,1,"[Arrested Development] breaks no new ground, and it goes over old ground in a way that feels odd to call ""pleasing,"" given the rampant dysfunction, but somehow is."
Arrested Development,1,The series' interest in intergenerational idiocy and corruption couldn't be more timely.
Arrested Development,0,"Limping badly out of the gate, the new season is disappointingly lackluster, often awkward, oddly paced... and I just didn't laugh all that much."
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
Arrested Development,1,"Structurally, Arrested is in better shape than it was in season four. Fans who temper their expectations for this new batch of episodes... will be happy to be back with the terrible Bluth family."
Arrested Development,1,"The result is a season of television that is, for better and for worse, even more self-aware than usual, but nonetheless sees the cast (mostly) returning in top form."
Arrested Development,1,"All that said, the first half of Season 5 is perfectly fine. Mostly funny. At moments scintillating... mostly a story about having watched ""Arrested Development."""
Arrested Development,0,The fifth season proves that not every canceled TV series should be resurrected.
Arrested Development,1,"The show is never better than when it has the dysfunctional family together on screen, and the way they bounce off each other in this season is as good as ever."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested was always a zany version of reality, but the cartoonishness feels hyperbolic now, unfocused."
Arrested Development,1,"""Arrested Development"" is back. You've earned the insanity."
Arrested Development,1,Season five is... not too bad. It is fine.
Arrested Development,1,The simple joy of seeing the Bluth family in the same room together in episode two should be enough to make season 5 a must-watch for diehard fans.
Arrested Development,1,Seeing the Bluths try something a little new - even when they inevitably and spectacularly fail - is way more fun than their retreads of seasons past.
Arrested Development,0,It's hard to argue that the show's maintained the sly political relevance that elevated it during its initial run.
Arrested Development,1,"It's nice to see the series return to the form it defined so many years ago with its rapid-fire, multiple-layer jokes."
Arrested Development,1,"Overall, it's more coherent and consistent than season four... even if it's not as inspired as the prime of the series."
Arrested Development,1,The series continues to deftly skewer the interpersonal dynamics of a hilariously dysfunctional family.
Arrested Development,0,They've made a huge mistake.
Arrested Development,0,"The elements that used to work so well for Arrested Development, the characters, the narration, the off-the-wall locations and concepts, now all clash rather than working together."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
Arrested Development,1,"It's hard not to garner satisfaction from seeing the gang all back together - but I hope, for everyone's sake, that it's for the last time."
Arrested Development,1,"Arrested Development feels like its old self again. More important, season five is funny, and gets funnier as it proceeds."
Arrested Development,0,"It's never a waste to follow the stories of these characters, but the experience is becoming increasingly hollow."
Arrested Development,1,The murderers' row of a cast... generally seems to be having fun each time they slip back into these characters.
Arrested Development,1,"Gone are the single-character episodes, extraneous guest stars and (unintentionally) awkward storylines from the 2013 fourth season."
Arrested Development,1,"With the cast reunited and a better understanding of what made the characters lovable lunkheads to begin with, the new season can be effortlessly enjoyable; a pleasure to watch instead of something you have to dig through to find the parts you love."
Arrested Development,1,"You might think it impossible, for example, to find new ways of mocking the rise of Trump. Yet Arrested Development does it brilliantly."
Sons of Anarchy,1,"Episode four was the best yet of the final season, setting into motion actions that will have dire consequences for Jax and SAMCRO."
Sons of Anarchy,1,"Sons of Anarchy works, in part, because it's designed as a soap opera for guys, wrapping emotional stories of family love, betrayal, sacrifice, scandal and murder in a mix of high-adrenaline outlaw action."
Sons of Anarchy,0,"While it will be interesting to see the way Sons tackles loose ends, in terms of how the series explores shades of gray, it looks like it's all over but the shooting."
Sons of Anarchy,1,"I'm a bit tired of turf wars and questionable loyalty but those common themes of the show almost feel like purposeful distractions here, ways to build tension and buy time until chaos erupts."
Sons of Anarchy,1,"Sons of Anarchy could be the antihero drama to end all antihero dramas, but it'll have to shift into some new gears to go out in the blaze of ingloriousness it deserves."
Sons of Anarchy,1,The series is going down in the same manner it started: as a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Doesn't sink its teeth in as firmly as The White Lotus, but it isn't here to just to play along with its chosen world either. And, in the process, it knows how to lure its audience in and keep them watching."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The new Hulu drama has everything going for it, which makes its failures even more striking."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"While the strong ensemble cast made for a promising set-up, the series was besmirched by an increasingly infuriating script and a trite ending that had this viewer hurling decaying vegetables at the screen."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Nicole Kidman achieves a powerful performance. [Full review in Spanish]
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Feeling superior is no substitute for feeling happy.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"This show seems to revel in its clichés rather than deconstructing them ... mostly, it settles for being bland and tasteful."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It's clearly cut from the same cloth as soapy stunner Big Little Lies, but this drama about a super-secretive wellness resort suffers from a lackluster story, though the cast is choice, and game."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Many wasted opportunities... Yet I'm reluctant to throw the baby out with the ionic bathwater if for nothing else than the fact that the characterizations are so damn strong here.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Slyly cryptic, slightly sinister mystery series, set in a holistic wellness center run by a mysteriously serene Russian who uses questionable treatments and experimental practices on her clients."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Dismissing Nine Perfect Strangers out of hand for not being sufficiently cynical ironically plays right into the psychosis experienced by the bulk of the characters from both dramas. Feeling superior is no substitute for feeling happy.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The perfect show for this format, so you have time to think and build anticipation between episodes. You want more..."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nicole Kidman rarely makes a mistake in her career choices. This time she did.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The cast are magnetic from the get-go, bouncing off one another in entertaining and sometimes explosive exchanges."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Evans is hilarious as the class-A jerk who seems to have no filter. Having never seen Evans in this light, it was quite entertaining to watch him showcase his comedic strengths."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Watch on, Macduff. Full in the knowledge, of course, that, when everything's revealed, the sore tooth may give way to that dread feeling of regretful gloom you get when faced with imminent root canal treatment."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The fun, in fact, lies in the silliness - and in the degree to which Kidman telegraphs how badly things are about to go for everyone by balefully waggling her eyebrows."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The overall quality of the cast adds a lot to the series, as does the idyllic setting. [It] manages keep us on tenterhooks from one episode to the next but when I sat down to reflect on what I'd seen it felt like a rather empty entertainment."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Arguably the most compelling, edgy actor on television. Kidman's performances and her hair always make for fascinating viewing, and Nine Perfect Strangers is no exception."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The series gets off to a slow start, but as one staff member puts it, it's a powder keg waiting to explode."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Playing a cult-like figure running a secretive resort, the only thing wobblier than the Australian Oscar winner's Russian accent are the lifeless scripts."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,How is Nine Perfect Strangers such a hot mess?
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Jonathan Levine adds little to the soapiness of the tale, despite some coolly elegant compositions from cinematographer Yves Belanger, who also shot Big Little Lies. Disappointing indeed."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The first three shows did a great job of building a tense atmosphere... In episode four, the show has to work noticeably harder to maintain the intrigue of before."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It's not only that Kelley has gussied up the average Californian spa menu in such a way that everything seems silly rather than satirical. The more he lays on the mysteries and the secrets... the less compelling it all feels.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,The show is enlivened just enough by the performances - Melissa McCarthy is the liveliest of the lot - for it not to sink into extended drudgery.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Ultimately though, while White Lotus and Succession have proven we can never get enough of the wealthy behaving badly, your enjoyment of Strangers will come down to your tolerance for Kidman's seemingly merciless and mercurial Masha."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Whether the series will pay off on a thematic level in its exploration of grief, trauma and psychological damage isn't yet clear, and you want it to be clearer three-quarters of the way in. But what is clear is the sheer amount of talent on screen."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It is like I've gone to therapy on a Gwyneth Paltrow GOOP retreat... I feel like I have to go to therapy after suffering through.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sorry, reader and watcher, Nine Perfect Strangers is a snoozefest."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers likely wouldn't impress at any point in the calendar. But the Hulu miniseries, adapted from a novel of the same name by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty, suffers from an especially serious case of bad timing."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,The stellar cast's obvious chemistry helps elevate a script that grows increasingly melodramatic as each of their character's secrets are brought to light.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Trippy, escapist and lush, Nine Perfect Strangers will entice you to stay for the whole journey, where you can enjoy some rest and relax in good company."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Shannon is Napoleon the most persuasive and complex character, who struggles and breaks down as they all will."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The team underplays the tart humor and wry empathy that make Moriarty's books such page-turning fun. But the series does look scrumptious, and Kelley and his fellow writers play the cliffhanger card just often enough to prime the binge-watching pump."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Each of these guests are broken in different ways, calibrated by Dmitrichenko and the screenwriters to intersect with each other through their attitudes, backgrounds, world-views."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It can be very comic, then turned, suddenly, into sadness or tragedy. We get to know these guests, and even the counselors, but slowly and partly through flashbacks that, like the interactions at the spa, take time to unravel."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Kidman is having a ball as the headliner with a character that's at once flashy and hiding trauma of her own.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Staying true to the modern wellness ideal, we are more than happy to immerse ourselves in the type of self-inflicted anguish that ultimately serves us with nothing but the knowledge that we are all indeed, perfectly imperfect."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It's Shannon, Keddie and Van Patten who have the most compelling storyline as a suburban family shattered by a recent loss, and who'll do almost anything to make it go away."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,It's refreshing to see comedy performers such as McCarthy maintain that finessed caustic wit but with a significant backstory to work with.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The cast almost seems as bewildered as their characters, thrust as they are into this beatific place with ominous undertones. It's unfortunate that they all get off on the wrong foot with each other nearly across the board."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,The first three-fourths of this series are a highly entertaining if increasingly wobbly ride. Think of a massage that's a little rough in spots but has you feeling better all the same.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"When you combine bold storytelling, dysfunctional relationships, uncomfortable truths, a health spa, and an all-star cast, you get pure fun."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Nine Perfect Strangers takes the wellness industry to creepily absurd extremes as it keeps you guessing -- and vowing never to trust a fruity health drink again.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers, in contrast to the strengths and limitations of [White] Lotus, tastes bland and feels tonally indistinct."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is entertaining enough, and features great performances, specifically from McCarthy and Hall, but the question of what Masha is exactly up to is never compelling enough to make the series a must watch."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a huge disappointment considering its star-studded cast and bestselling source material. More than anything else, the Hulu series feels hollow."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers suffers from the same chronic issue that so many television adaptations of juicy novels do: it fails to capture the sneaky, get-under-your-skin tendency of its engrossing source material."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series, as it cycles through satire, horror, and prestige psychodrama, can't quite decide whether the wellness industry is a virulent scam or a desperately needed curative for broken souls."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers may not be five-star TV, but for an audience starved for indulgence, it does the job."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If only one of these people would have the decency to drop dead, it would make the show infinitely more engaging."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I wish the series had more of a clear idea of what its genre was, other than crazy and trippy. Nine Perfect Strangers is at its best when Bobby Cannavale and Melissa McCarthy are allowed to display all of their comedic aptitude on screen."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Combining this cast with these creators and a bestselling novel adaptation are the ingredients for success, but it falls short with its story."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Each of the attendees are cliches of various stripes, nonetheless played by big names."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"These are all fascinating, well-developed characters (played by a remarkable cast) who we can't help but become invested in quickly."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Great monologues can exist in counterproductive prestige TV, and for all of the power that the A-list ensemble brought to this wellness retreat ... the pacing itself from director Jonathan Levine has far too little emotional momentum."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,One crucial departure from the formula is the writing.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"While the plot advances slowly, the writing compensates for that by spreading around meaty material for the actors in this adult summer camp, no small feat in this sort of exercise."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Kidman, meanwhile, is clearly having a grand old time as the increasingly unhinged Masha, bathed in an otherworldly glow. It's hardly her most subtle work, but she steals every scene with the sheer force of her weirdness."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Strangers, with its hallucinatory trippiness, is more about the surreal."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers with Kidman in the lead has a stellar cast of talented actors, but there's less going on with this story than the trailer (edited as a scary story) implies."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is neither groundbreaking nor especially resonant, but with an excellent cast carrying an intriguing story, the series still adds up to time well-spent."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series isn't the surprising horror-esque piece it could be, and it doesn't offer a compelling statement on wellness or the people who buy into it. Nothing really happens at all here."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The trouble is, few of these revelations succeed in building suspense... Happily, the cast picks up much of the slack, making Strangers quite watchable despite its aimlessness."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"With the exception of Ms. Van Patten's Zoe, you wouldn't give your extra bottle of kombucha to any of these people."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Maybe it'll tie together in the final two episodes and reach a dramatically satisfying conclusion with a few nifty turns and twists down the stretch. So far, though, this is a perfectly mediocre affair."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Kidman has the range to play both the unicorn and the woman, but nobody bothered to give her the more important part of that equation."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,It's also highly dramatic and unmissably entertaining.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Is to its audience kind of like Tranquillum House is to the group of troubled men and women who decide to stay there: a place that sounds like a great investment on paper but feels confusing and not quite what you expected once you arrive.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Nine Perfect Strangers starts off a little slow but soon reels you in with its mysterious tale.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is over-stuffed with plot and under serves its characters, but it fits the bill of empty summer TV."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"McCarthy, a delight as always, gets loads of screen time but also seems disconnected from the main story."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It's easy to keep watching, even when the nine strangers' struggles don't add up to as much as you'd hope."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,A perfect TV series for this moment of palpable uncertainty in the world. It's an absorbing and seductive portrait of the relationships between people and how even strangers can effectively make space for one another to heal their past traumas.
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"It's a role that allows Kidman to make the most of her almost emotionless mask-like, very smooth, otherworldly face and intelligent, knowing eyes."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Masha's a megalomaniac who can't help playing god when given the chance. But she feels increasingly generic as the series chugs along, flattening from a female Keith Raniere to a life-size cardboard cutout of him."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"This smart, succinct script pulls you into uncharted territory, satisfying your intellectual and emotional cravings."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The Amazon release looks to be a slow-burn mystery that's settling itself in for the long game. Anything could happen at this point, and the opening gets enough right to spark audience curiosity."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a TKO, right? Well, perhaps on paper. In execution, the limited series based on Moriarty's 2018 novel is -- as my grandmother used to say -- all over the shop."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The ensemble cast's chemistry shines throughout this eight-parter, with Michael Shannon in particular delivering a stunning, award-worthy performance."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a top-notch cast, and the collective strengths of the actors make the series sing when the rest is flimsy. But the mystery at the heart of it all... isn't always effective, more an afterthought rather than a prevalent riddle."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nicole Kidman deploys her witchy beauty to the maximum as white-clad, perma-serene Masha: she's all poise, watchful, flickering eyes, half-smile, gentle Russian accent."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The tone wanders, mixing scenes in ominously idyllic locations with supposedly meaningful closeups of fruit being whipped into submission for smoothies."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"A fun, mystery thriller with enough laughs and twists to keep you engaged, Nine Perfect Strangers is an enjoyable late summer romp."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The new Hulu miniseries has a lot to offer, especially in small moments between the characters, but doesn't quite have the same grasp Big Little Lies did. But, with a cast like this, who wouldn't want to spend eight episodes living in their world?"
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Audiences who appreciate melodrama and the slow burn of threat best make themselves acquainted with these particular strangers
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"While there is a sameness to all three of Kidman's most recent TV/streaming projects, there's no denying they're addictive soaps. Nine Perfect Strangers benefits tremendously from Hall playing against type and the presence of McCarthy."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"The new eight-episode miniseries is Peak Kidman... She lights up the story, and brings fascination to even the weakest plot strands."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"With Nicole Kidman at the head of a thoughtfully selected cast, this intriguing mystery drama reels the viewer in quickly, deploying just enough dry humour to keep it from becoming an emotional grind."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers is a big budget, psychedelic soap opera, a high camp satire about the extreme wellness industry that is outrageous, engrossing and just a little bit silly in equal measure."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers, in all its twisted, perfectly manicured glory, is an excellent adaptation of Liane Moriarty's novel of the same name."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Let's be real, it's likely Kidman whose performance we're all here for, and she does not disappoint."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"There are secrets, revelations, and even death threats, but ""Nine Perfect Strangers"" is about damaged people trying to heal in a place run by a mysterious woman who may need the most healing of all."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Nine Perfect Strangers makes one wish that Kidman will continue to find potboiler novels about everyday human issues to adapt into lavish, star-studded TV programmes."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Much like the enigmatic host of Tranquillum House, ""Nine Perfect Strangers"" will lure you in and convinces you to stay for the entire journey."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I'd watch these characters all day under the simplicity of a spotlight and a monologue, free from the pretentious packaging. It's a shame that the show seems to get hit with a tranquilizer dart after the first couple of episodes ..."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"""Nine Perfect Strangers"" is straightforward in setting forth its story and its stakes, and its best moments probe the lengths people go to become well. Its lack of subtlety seems, in these scenes, to be an asset."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,Nine Perfect Strangers excels in balancing its incredible ensemble cast. Every performance in the series is well-acted and thoroughly engaging.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If The White Lotus is 30 Rock, then Nine Perfect Strangers is Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip: not ""good,"" exactly, and definitely way overblown, but still watchable in its own strange way."
Nine Perfect Strangers,1,"Director Jonathan Levine's greatest success is in making this cast work together so cohesively, even if the fluctuations of the tone occasionally get distracting, as if it's never totally clear what this show wants to be."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
Black Sails,1,"There are enough pieces in place that should make final season of ""Black Sails"" a shiver-me-timbers fun ride."
Black Sails,1,Chock full of action and high drama.
Black Sails,1,Manages to walk a delicate line between relying too heavily on the story to come and winking at viewers who might be looking for the occasional easter egg.
Black Sails,1,"If you didn't watch Black Sails this year, you missed out on a masterpiece."
Black Sails,0,"Unfortunately, there's not a lot of wind at the back of the Emmy-winning Treasure Island prequel's final 10 episodes, and not many waves to be made by its exit."
Black Sails,1,The season looks like it's off to a strong start.
Black Sails,1,"Sound design and cinematography are in top form, and at this point it's almost unnecessary to say each cast member is competing to steal a scene. But it's all in service of the character drama that makes it all matter."
Black Sails,1,"Black Sails threw us right into the center of chaos with an opening onslaught that was both an awesome spectacle and crucial to the story going forward, as perhaps pertaining to Flint vs. Silver."
Black Sails,1,Black Sails must have the hardest working cast and crew of any TV series bar none.
Black Sails,0,"Though there are hints of better things to come, the early goings of Black Sails season 4 are light on fun and adventure."
Snowfall,1,"Although it's still my favorite drama right now, it definitely wasn't as good as the last season."
Snowfall,1,Breakups are never easy. Breaking up with family? Difficult. Breaking up with friends? Devastating. Breaking up with the state? Nearly impossible.
Snowfall,1,"Snowfall is full of great acting from top to bottom, with family politics, big money crime, violent disputes, and power shifting intrigue to spare."
Snowfall,1,"None of this can end well, it would seem, but it’s a dark, enjoyable, sharply etched ride in the meantime."
Snowfall,1,"Snowfall just feels different this time around, as it shifts gears and focuses not on getting power, but how one might hold on to it when the whole landscape is changing."
Superstore,1,The best heir to The Office. [Full review in Spanish]
Superstore,1,"Despite Superstore's focus on the cruelty of corporate America and the precarious situation of working-class people, it's never a depressing show. It's full of joy and warmth, reveling in the eccentricities of its characters."
Superstore,1,"Check out this wonderfully underrated gem of a show if you haven't seen it before, you won't regret it."
Superstore,1,"I'm not sure that there's anything else I can add after its delightfully satisfying, enormously sweet finale, except to say that I truly love Superstore."
Superstore,1,It set a solid bar for what a modern workplace comedy can be-funny and smart and intensely honest without ever getting too dark or veering into Very Special Episode territory.
Superstore,1,"We probably won't miss the store, but we'll miss its employees dearly."
Superstore,1,It inspired and educated; it made us laugh and cry; it surprised us and gave us exactly what we needed. It invested in people.
Superstore,1,Superstore really did have a solid ability to turn oddities like this one into laugh-out-loud humor.
Superstore,1,"As Superstore comes to an end, it's too late to give it all the flowers it deserves, but it's not too late to uphold it as having set a standard for the TV sitcom, particularly of the workplace variety."
Superstore,1,"That Superstore is so soothing is largely down to the enduring delightfulness of America Ferrera as Amy, a slightly put-upon worker at a Midwestern big-box store that serves as an employer of last resort for numerous misfits and weirdos."
Superstore,1,"There is genuinely sweet character growth and rewarding ongoing plots... which make it a great binge, but not to the point where it's inaccessible for those who might want to start watching right now without catching up."
Superstore,1,"One might think that people are watching television to escape the realities of the world they live in, but Superstore's presentation is unmatched."
Superstore,0,"Looking at the way the masked actors try valiantly to make the comedy go over with only their eyes and brows in the front-of-house scenes, I can see why the show made this decision, but still: Two raps on the knuckles from Dr. Fauci for that one."
Superstore,1,The Superstore Series Finale is one for the books.
Superstore,1,"There are needles threaded here, real horrors acknowledged without departing from our long-established characters' funny perspectives."
Mayans M.C.,1,"This is a beautifully written, well-executed, impactful drama about revenge, violence, and brotherhood."
Mayans M.C.,1,"The storytelling was on top form, and the writers did a great job of cleverly executing this revelation that has officially lit the fuse on the war between the Mayans and the Sons of Anarchy."
The Act,0,"It's dull and lacking in creativity, and it's disheartening that what could have been an interesting exploration of factitious disorder imposed on another - and why we're morbidly fascinated by it - became a tawdry, unoriginal series of cheap shots."
The Act,1,"The cast is full of talent - including Margo Martindale, who plays Dee Dee's mom in flashbacks - but the show belongs to the two principals."
The Act,1,I was so interested in how the creators were going to tell this story... and I was floored by the result.
The Act,1,"The tension is palpable in every scene, and this tension is supported by two career-best performances from Patricia Arquette and Joey King."
The Act,1,"I enjoyed it for the performances: Chloë Sevigny, as Dee Dee's plain-talking neighbour Mel, and Joey King, who is brilliant as Dee Dee's helium-voiced daughter."
The Act,1,"All the writing was so well done, and each of the directors who came on-board kept things visually interesting, offering compelling imagery and juxtaposition of scenes that really helped the whole story, and its important themes, shine bright."
The Act,1,"The tone of the series is uneven, playing at times like an episode of a network procedural and at others like a so-called elevated genre piece."
The Act,1,"As long as The Act steers straight as far as sticking to the truth, the show will be as confounding and entertaining as it needs to be."
The Act,1,"Although meticulously factual and spectacularly acted, The Act is the kind of entertainment that ultimately makes the enjoyment I get from the true crime genre feel seriously questionable, if not entirely indefensible."
The Act,0,"Like many miniseries, the show suffers from pacing issues, hitting the same beats repeatedly to the point of frustration."
The Act,1,"The way the story is presented makes it easy to view it as a drama, and see how the events unfold, and with the amazing performances of Joey King and Patricia Arquette, it's set up to be a very addictive series so far."
The Act,0,"But what do we really learn about human nature, apart from: some people are weird? I enjoyed it for the performances: Chloë Sevigny, as Dee Dee's plain-talking neighbour Mel, and Joey King, who is brilliant as Dee Dee's helium-voiced daughter."
The Act,1,Unsettling take on the fantastic story that ended in tragedy. The Act is a fine piece of true crime that won't be forgotten any time soon. [Full review in Spanish].
The Act,1,"The Act works as an absorbing, well-paced drama."
The Act,1,"'The Act' is disturbing, it is hard to see, it is addictive and it is done with a very good hand. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Act,1,"I have no doubt that when you reach the end of this season, you may not be able to stomach much more, but I hope Hulu keeps the stories coming."
The Act,1,"The Act may be too much for some viewers to handle, but it's a masterwork in true crime storytelling and one of the most exciting new additions to Hulu's library."
The Act,1,"Dark, toxic mother-daughter tale is based on a true story."
The Act,1,"Perhaps more than a study of true crime, The Act is a show about the fierce attachment between mothers and daughters, gone horribly wrong."
The Act,1,"The Act never quite went too far for me, as it kept finding new angles on its very difficult-to-watch story."
The Act,0,The story here... just drags on where a quicker pace would clearly be more effective in a journey where the destination is already determined.
The Act,1,"This is body horror by way of Walt Disney, a ghoulish fantasia of princess gowns, stuffed animals, prescription drugs, and physical harm."
The Act,1,"Every bit as engaging as it is disturbing, the true crime character study is anchored by two masterful performances from leads Patricia Arquette and Joey King."
The Act,1,The hoax is by far the most interesting part of this season. The actual murder feels like an afterthought.
The Act,1,[Joey King] adroitly moves between childlike guilelessness and cold-blooded duplicity with surprising believability.
The Act,1,"The character will be remembered as an icon of our era of grift, alongside the antiheroes of Fyre Fraud, The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley, and The Apprentice."
The Act,1,"Joey King, once Ramona in Ramona and Beezus does a good job as the daughter, as does Chlöe Sevigny as a suspicious neighbor."
The Act,1,"The combination of subject and sequencing creates an eerie atmosphere, but pushing a bit further stylistically could have made this a campy treat instead of something caught between sincere storytelling and the bizarre true story."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
The Act,0,Watching the series becomes a bit of a slog where you are just waiting for the crime to happen so that the narrative can move forward.
The Act,1,"Mental illness and the ways it colors incomprehensible choices rarely has such easy, tidy resolutions. The Act understands this fact at a painful level, and leaves you gasping from the results."
The Act,1,Arquette's performance is one for the mother-as-monster chronicles.
The Act,1,"The Act remains oddly fascinating, perhaps especially so as the strange, sad relationship between the needy Gypsy and disturbed Nick (Calum Worthy) develops."
The Act,1,"The scripts by Dean and Antosca and the performances by the two leads do a fine job exploring the murky power dynamic between mother and child... Both actors are terrific, but King is more likely the one people will be talking about after."
The Act,1,"In large part, the success of The Act so far comes down to one person: Joey King."
The Act,1,"I don't know quite how to feel about The Act, about the discomfort of seeing childhood abuse dressed up on screen, even if I know it's not for gawking, even if I recognize the pull the Blanchard story has on me anyway. Perhaps that is the point."
The Act,1,"Even with some lags in pacing, each time I thought the story was running out of juice, it found a different gear and a different genre, all anchored by King and Arquette."
The Act,1,The series is so cleverly layered and edited that there are a few moments when one could be tempted to feel sorry for this terrible mother.
The Act,1,The show captures the level of fascination that was present in the Buzzfeed article... It serves as a great piece of additional insight into the events that transpired.
The Act,1,"A reminder that even when you think you know a great deal about true story, there can be value in retelling it."
The Act,1,"The Act never seizes an opportunity to make us understand why Dee Dee manufactured this system of toxic codependency, missing out on an ""Aha!"" moment that might've made The Act magical. But for plain old Mommy horror fun, The Act does its job nicely."
The Act,1,"It's as weird as any David Lynch drama, only true, and Arquette disappears into her role with absolute conviction."
The Act,1,"Ms. Arquette's nuanced performance remains top-notch, and Ms. King proves a talented newcomer with a bright acting future."
The Act,1,Patricia Arquette continues her chameleon-like acting renaissance in The Act.
The Act,1,"The riveting and increasingly twisted scenario plays like What Ever Happened to Baby Gypsy? as overbearing Dee Dee infantalizes her teenage daughter Gypsy, falsely presenting her to the public as a disabled, needy Disney princess."
The Act,1,"The Act is a gothic horror Lifetime movie on steroids, and I say that only with love. Great lead performances anchor it, but the series might have benefited from fewer episodes"
The Act,1,"The Act is fascinating for a number of reasons, but a chief one is the performances of its two leads, Patricia Arquette and Joey King."
The Act,1,"Generally, ""The Act"" nails what it's going for - a grotty, nasty, poisonous fable whose punch comes from the fact that some version of it really happened but that would be compelling regardless."
The Act,1,"""The Act"" is a compelling narrative to add to a post-#MeToo world. Men abuse power and sexuality of women, and in this case, a woman is abusing her power and sexuality of another woman (specifically her daughter)."
Chance,1,"Pair these sentiments with a masterful performance from Hugh Laurie, as well as gorgeous cinematography."
Chance,1,"The only thing I love more than Nicole's development, is D's."
Chance,1,"The series is a slow burner, but the noir mystery and Laurie keep the flames going."
Homeland,1,"The character and show itself play with, question, and subvert notions of white womanhood"
Homeland,1,I never believed I'd dedicate nearly 100 hours of my life to watching the series.
Homeland,1,"This may be the end, but only a brave man would bet against her return."
Homeland,1,"Homeland has been an exceptional drama, perfectly capturing our anxiety about omnipotent nutters..."
Homeland,1,Homeland has been one of the most consistently entertaining series in this new golden age of television.
Homeland,0,"The pacing for the whole season was completely off, an issue that became far more of a problem as Carrie and Saul returned to America."
Homeland,1,It was a sharp opening episode... It's great to see such a complex character on television. If only we knew whether to trust her.
Homeland,1,"Setting the stage before the final curtain, Homeland and Claire Danes have reminded audiences why we were so enraptured when it first debuted nearly 10 years ago."
Homeland,1,"It's been a swansong befitting of a character who'll be missed -- a character who, until her final hour, has been one of television's all-time greats."
Homeland,1,"It's hard to say that later Homeland is ""better"" than those chaotic early years, but mentor-mentee friction between Carrie and Saul was worth sticking around for. And [the finale] was, above all else, a satisfying pay-off to that relationship."
Homeland,1,"Taking plenty of dramatic license, Homeland has always put a spotlight on how the decisions, the feints and the gut calls made by nameless operatives in the field can avert disaster and change the course of history."
Homeland,1,Placing a question mark above Carrie's time in captivity is just one of the hooks that the producers have deployed to drive the last burst of this impressive espionage drama.
Homeland,1,"Homeland is a serviceable spy thriller with some superior turns. But if this had been the debut season, we would not have had eight of them."
Homeland,0,"Medically speaking, it's probably inadvisable to treat bipolarity as a superpower. But that's where we are."
Homeland,0,"Rven though the circumstances are new... it still felt like déjà vu. We have had this vibe, this dynamic before - many times."
Homeland,1,"For all its lurid overacting and preposterous plots, I'll miss Homeland when it's over."
Homeland,1,"To have the final season employ Carrie's mental illness, and her enemies' despicable manipulation of it, to investigate everything that makes Carrie redeemable points to a riveting journey ahead."
Homeland,1,This eighth season is a worthy final chapter sticking to the notes that have worked best.
Homeland,1,"Fine, sharp opener to what already feels like a tragic climax."
Homeland,1,[Returns] Homeland to a share of its former glory -- in the view of someone who pulled away a few years ago; others never abandoned it -- by bringing the show's theme full circle to where it began.
Homeland,1,Freeing itself of its original narrative moorings has done it nothing but good. It's also a testament to the thoughtfulness and intelligence of showrunners Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa that it has stayed so on the ball.
Homeland,1,"My favorite part of the new season, honestly, might have been reflecting on how, after this lengthy Homeland journey, the character who has gravitated up the call sheet by virtue of sheer survival has been Maury Sterling's Max."
Homeland,0,"The finish wasn't entirely convincing, and while it provided a degree of closure, didn't loop back to the show's origins as deftly as one might have hoped."
Homeland,1,"The first three episodes are a bit clunky, with Carrie's familiar pattern of alienating nearly everyone she meets kicking in again - and then Episode 4 comes along and ""Homeland"" finds its groove."
Homeland,1,"The first four episodes of the season have their wild plot lurches but also the gimlet eye for human nature of ""Homeland"" at its best."
Homeland,0,"Overall the first four episodes made available for review plod along... But then, just as I'm about to write off this final season, something happens at the end of the fourth episode that pulls me right back in. Just like Carrie, I can't seem to let go."
Homeland,1,"Lesli Linka Glatter returns for the first two episodes... and, for as much credit as she rightly gets for her beautifully staged and tensely cut action sequences, the performances she evokes in a still or slightly shifting frame are incredible."
Castle Rock,1,"As intellectually stimulating as it was the first time around with a sensational performance from a captivating Lizzy Caplan, and a punchier pace."
Castle Rock,1,"While the second season doesn't end on quite the slam-bang note that the first did, it does a very solid job of tying this season into Misery proper, leaving the door wide open for what might happen in the show's next iteration."
Castle Rock,1,"Despite some potential lost, we still got a character-driven, compelling season, with the sensation of something old, dreadful and especially eerie seeping out of the history of Castle Rock into its new inhabitants."
Castle Rock,1,"Season 2 evokes the best Stephen King adaptations by ramping up the pacing, dread, and slasher flick fun in a way the first season didn't."
Castle Rock,0,"There are so many threads being woven together, and try as they might, there's just not enough knots being tied to make it all work. In the end, everyone suffers, and we're left with cheeky references, hollow drama, and zero stakes."
Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock delivers the expected violence, suspense, and horror. But its most abundant strength is its faithful adherence to one of King's primary tenets as an author: that there is nothing more frightening then the unpredictability of human nature."
Castle Rock,1,One of this season's greatest strengths is how it excels at depicting Annie's psychosis and paranoia in visually different and creative ways. It continually feels fresh and stressful.
Castle Rock,1,"A lot of horror anthologies hinge on concept instead of character or performance, but I'm happy to see ""Castle Rock"" bucking that trend."
Castle Rock,1,"Like its impressive and satisfying inaugural run, this latest season of Castle Rock is filled with clever writing, delightful callbacks to King's book universe and terrific performances."
Castle Rock,1,"It's a dark ending, to be sure, but the right one."
Castle Rock,1,Castle Rock's second season gets a welcome fresh coat of creative paint with the addition of Lizzy Caplan's engaging performance as Misery's Annie Wilkes.
Castle Rock,1,This is a great starting point to understanding Annie Wilkes... if that's possible.
Castle Rock,1,"Reinterpreting a beloved Stephen King villain like Annie Wilkes is a tall order, but Lizzy Caplan makes it look easy."
Castle Rock,1,"One episode in, this season of Castle Rock is pulpy in a way season one didn't attempt. It's quick and sharp and tense and breathless."
Castle Rock,1,"Whether you love or could leave the rest of Castle Rock, know this: Lizzy Caplan will blow you away."
Castle Rock,1,"Thanks to excellent work on Caplan's part, and a surprising narrative twist that once again defies expectations early on, we can't wait to see how her infamous character plays out in the rest of this season."
Castle Rock,1,"It remains to be seen whether the end result will be a success, or end with the sort of vaguely disappointing whimper last season landed on, but for now I'm absolutely thrilled by the guts the show has found."
Castle Rock,1,The show is finally more than a flailing attempt to monetize Stephen King-related intellectual property.
Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock remains an atmospheric, grippingly acted series that captures the feeling of King's fiction while exploring corners of his world that even he might not have imagined existing."
Castle Rock,1,"[Lizzie] Caplan, is unsettlingly good as Annie, giving a performance that can be emotionally poignant in one scene and petrifying in another, turning on a dime in an instant."
Castle Rock,1,"What's here is still effective, affecting, and original - despite appearances."
Castle Rock,1,S2 has a morbid magnetism that pulls you in and makes you hit play all over again at the end of every episode.
Castle Rock,1,King fans will get a continued kick out of their favorite King tropes being thrown together.
Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion."
Castle Rock,1,"In its first half...Castle Rock keeps the supernatural elements lurking on the periphery, focusing instead on characters and family melodrama, anchored by Lizzy Caplan's commanding performance at the center."
Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.
Castle Rock,1,"The moody atmosphere from the first season is back, and the show never really lets up from that."
Castle Rock,0,"I can't tell if the new season is over-reaching, under-reaching or if the Annie Wilkes of it all is just overshadowing the story to an unanticipated degree."
Castle Rock,1,"There's still plenty of King paraphernalia floating around for eagle-eyed viewers to latch onto, but Castle Rock is no longer so insistent of its importance to the overall story. Instead, the series mercifully lets the narrative speak for itself."
Castle Rock,1,"Castle Rock Season 2 does a wonderful job of borrowing reoccurring themes from King's massive body of work and splicing them together to make something that appears, at least on its surface, wholly original."
Castle Rock,1,"I wish I could tell you about all of the twists and turns this season takes, but that would ruin what is shaping up to be one of the best seasons of television this year."
Castle Rock,1,"Despite all its high drama, season two feels a little more conventional in its narrative, and that'll likely make for a more satisfying story arc, especially with all the horror-fantasy elements to come."
Castle Rock,1,"[Caplan's] performance is masterfully physical, from her carefully impassive smile to the way she holds her arms stiffly at her sides as she walks; the actress embodies a woman who is struggling to control a constant surge of inner turmoil."
Castle Rock,1,"Anchored by Lizzy Caplan's compelling performance, this season has cracked the Stephen King code for a thrilling and engaging mystery."
Castle Rock,1,"Misery and 'Salem's Lot, two vastly different King novels, make for strange bedfellows."
Castle Rock,1,"The show is thoughtfully written by showrunners Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason, who have a knack for character and an ear for Kingian dialogue, and the gifted cast gives it everything they have."
Fear the Walking Dead,0,"Colman Domingo was as good as always, but all the exposition dumps and plot holes really dragged the [premiere] down, blunting what could have -- in more adept hands -- been a strong opener for Season Seven."
11.22.63,1,"While ""11.22.53"" never really reaches the level of craftsmanship of ""House of Cards"" or ""The Man In the High Castle,"" it makes up for it in it's immense ""can't stop watching"" entertainment value."
11.22.63,1,"The pilot was an absolute home run, setting up a slate of fascinating characters with complex dynamics and a world of opportunity."
11.22.63,1,"Despite its occasional clumsiness, 11.22.63 is an entertaining effort."
11.22.63,1,"There is still so much story to tell in 11.22.63, so many triumphs and mischances awaiting, but ""The Rabbit Hole"" started on such strong footing that the rest of the journey feels like it's in the bag."
11.22.63,1,"Overall, however, the series makes for decent passive television, something that can be consumed while simultaneously preoccupied with another passive activity."
11.22.63,1,This is a good old-fashioned (by which I mean 1990s) quirky thriller for which Franco is perfectly cast.
11.22.63,1,"An engrossing, utterly unique story and winning performances from Franco and Gadon conspire to make 11.22.63 a can't-miss TV event."
11.22.63,1,It's the softer side of 11.22.63 that makes it so compelling.
11.22.63,1,11.22.63 is solid and fairly evenly paced throughout.
11.22.63,1,"The finale is beautifully done and beautifully carried by Mr. Franco, thought-provoking and heartbreaking at once."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 is just here to entertain. And that's fine! But if the series wanted us to look past some truly awful things Jake does in the name of changing the past, it should've clarified what it wanted us to think of its protagonist."
11.22.63,1,"King has had a spotty record with adaptations of his work, but this 11.22.63 does a good job of capturing him at a moment of storytelling tightness."
11.22.63,1,"The premise of 11.22.63 is great and interesting, and while the material is too long for a feature film, it is too short for an 8-hour mini-series."
11.22.63,1,A good old-fashioned slice of sci-fi/ horror hokum with a welcome edge that revitalises the time-travel sub-genre.
11.22.63,1,"It's not a bad goal for the social good-minded time traveller, or more importantly to the matter at hand, a bad premise for a flashy miniseries designed to get attention."
11.22.63,1,James Franco is the perfect foil for the can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it creepiness of 11.22.63.
11.22.63,1,"It might take a little while to get into it, but you'll be sad when it's over."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 sets forth with a fascinating premise, but gets a little too distracted by superfluous material that only causes it to get sidetracked from the main plot, resulting in a slightly unfocused show with problematic execution."
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63's aesthetics are tantalizing, the acting compelling, and the twists and supernatural elements are genuinely shocking."
11.22.63,1,"Buoyed by a period-piece narrative that, over the course of eight-plus hours, it clearly and evocatively dramatizes with equal emphasis on what-if fantasy, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and subtle emotional depth."
11.22.63,1,"This ambitious adaptation of Stephen King's novel sets out to achieve a lot in just eight episodes. And in the end it does, thanks to solid acting and some incredibly convenient plot points."
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
11.22.63,1,"I dug it, and was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the project, given its seemingly modest means and the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, Hulu has never attempted something quite of this scale before."
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63 isn't for everyone. You have to like what-if fantasy stories. But like many of King's stories, once you're in, you're in. Enjoy the trip."
11.22.63,0,"It may not be worth the price of the subscription, if you don't already have one, but that is a decision you will have to make for yourself, viewer."
11.22.63,1,"At times it's brilliant, actually."
11.22.63,0,"I'm still not entirely convinced about 11.22.63 just yet. While I have always enjoyed Franco as an actor, I'm not getting the sense of conviction that I got from book-Jake."
11.22.63,1,"Despite being almost an hour and a half long, the hectic nature of Epping's journey is bound to keep you engaged from beginning to end, and leave plenty of viewers excited for the next episode."
11.22.63,1,What works about the series' rules of time travel is the same thing that works about Jake and Sadie's relationship: it's all expressed pretty simply and driven home just enough to make you care.
11.22.63,1,"One would think Hulu might try copying the Netflix model and release all the episodes at once. Because if there's a Hulu series that invites a binge-watch, it's this one."
11.22.63,1,"JFK assassination conspiracy theorists won't be disappointed with King's whodunit premise in 11/22/63, although they might argue with it. Likewise, the miniseries has something for fans of science fiction, romance and thrillers in general."
11.22.63,1,"Whether 11.22.63 will be able to provide both a strong plot (which it has so far) and strong characterization (which is still a work in progress), well, only time will tell."
11.22.63,1,An absorbing eight-episode show based on King's best-selling 11/22/63.
11.22.63,1,"As I watched this eight-part series, I was moved by the earnest urgency with which James Franco's Jake Epping works to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets from being fired."
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63 is an enjoyable watch, even if - like most of us over 30 - it gets a little fat in the mid-section."
11.22.63,1,"11.22.63 is sometimes a bumpy ride, but the destination is ultimately worth the journey."
11.22.63,1,"Dig into 11.22.63, and time will slip by in the best possible way."
11.22.63,1,"The net effect is ultimately intoxicating if you accept that the digressions are the point of the story, and are in fact inevitable given the sort of person Jake is."
11.22.63,1,A Hulu winner.
11.22.63,1,"A clean, direct adaptation of King's novel, in all the best ways."
11.22.63,1,"The eight-part miniseries, which begins streaming Monday, immaculately recreates the era - but it's also, at its beating heart, an exquisite romance about sacrifice and the perils of optimism."
11.22.63,1,Hulu's most ambitious original project... a well-crafted period look and an engaging leading man in Franco. But that slow pace makes it tough for viewers to stick around long enough to learn if Jake ever becomes the hero he's striving to be.
11.22.63,0,That the limited series squeaks by as just entertaining enough is a disappointment considering the pedigree of everyone involved and the reputation of its source material. Time travel and Dealey Plaza deserve better.
11.22.63,1,"It's totally far-fetched, but the roles are so well-cast and the 1960s texture so evocatively re-created... that 11.22.63 makes the trip back in time both suspenseful and enjoyable."
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
11.22.63,1,"Despite its flaws, 11.22.63 ends up closing the deal in a way that for the most part makes it a long, strange time travel worth taking."
11.22.63,1,"It's a strong and suspenseful hook, and the first chapters are quite compelling."
11.22.63,1,"Masterfully textured and compellingly told, 11.22.63 is a smart and stylish take on Stephen King's sprawling novel."
11.22.63,1,"Staying true to the genre, the eight-part adaptation of Stephen King's novel is heavy on fantasy and light on physics."
11.22.63,1,"It's somewhat uneven and doesn't always make perfect sense, but, in a way, the absence of predictability becomes one of the show's most useful assets."
11.22.63,1,"It's a fun and easily absorbing thriller wrapped inside a cautionary tale about indulging in nostalgia - and best of all, it has a definite and emotionally satisfying conclusion."
11.22.63,1,"A Hulu viewer who doesn't know the book at all won't miss the Jodie interludes, and may well find 11.22.63 a pretty good What If? story."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 reaches some thoughtful, moving conclusions, but oh, what coulda been with a more engaged star. If only there were a time machine to fix that mistake."
11.22.63,1,"There is much here that has undeniable appeal, most of it having to do with the impressive period detail of the early '60s."
11.22.63,1,"It's not a flashy production with complex themes, like HBO's Vinyl, say, but its likable and engaging."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
11.22.63,1,"While the construction of 11.22.63 holds it back from greatness, Franco deserves credit for really committing to the high concept of it all."
11.22.63,1,The James Franco starrer is a very entertaining set of 8-episodes that tells a complete and interesting narrative. It's not particularly deep - you won't find yourself questioning any of life's big questions by its end - but it's a very enjoyable watch.
11.22.63,1,"Its best moments thrum with tension, as when the past rebels against our hero, trying to repel him. You probably shouldn't try to go back to the past. But whether it comes to changing history or reviving a genre, it's too tempting not to try."
11.22.63,1,Very engrossing and well-acted.
11.22.63,1,"Even in its slower moments, 11.22.63 demands attention because King has crafted a story you want to watch unfold, with the question of whether the trip back is worth the cost always at the forefront, providing the stakes."
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
11.22.63,1,"Come for the plot points, stay for the constant life-threatening danger for James Franco."
Casual,1,"The season leads you down the rabbit hole toward what would be a cliche happy ending for some of these characters, but like quintessential Casual, what you expect to happen doesn't always happen."
Casual,1,"""Casual"" packs an extraordinary amount of plot and wit into each half-hour episode."
Casual,1,"Casual never hesitated to dig into its uncomfortable interpersonal relationships, but it always managed to do so with humor. And it remained fully committed to having its characters grow and evolve realistically, right until the very end."
Casual,1,"Casual is a brittle but sharp and adult comedy-drama about life, love, family, friendship and figuring out that, if your parents screwed up, it's up to you to make a better life."
Casual,1,For fans of the last three seasons there will be some fitting resolutions and fun surprises.
Casual,1,"It's about finding the right kind of happiness for these characters at this stage in their lives, and creator Zander Lehmann strikes the exact right balance to send the series off on a pitch-perfect note."
Casual,1,Casual is not the kind of show where huge events and twists and turns drive the show along. It has always been simply about these people's lives.
Casual,1,"It's about love, not hate, so while certain critics may feel the need to lash out in anger at a thing of beauty pulled from us too soon, these four seasons provide a lifetime of moments to treasure."
Casual,1,"Right up to the end, Casual excels at showing us what's in parentheses."
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
Scandal,1,"More than a guilty pleasure, Scandal's success was proof of the power of female viewers, especially black women."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
Scandal,1,I have little doubt it will be fun to take the ride.
Scandal,1,"If this was a sort-of farewell to the Shondaland brand at its height, Scandal delivered an hour that felt very much in keeping with what preceded it, which is what any good finale should aspire to do."
Scandal,1,"I am enjoying this Olivia Pope. When she sets her sights on something, she goes for it, and she's starting out strong this season with a clear view of what she wants."
Scandal,1,Scandal was more than its wildest plot twists or Olivia's white hat. It was a very real hit that changed the TV industry in more ways than one.
Scandal,1,"[Olivia] might be gone, but her legacy is permanent."
Scandal,1,"Well, we didn't see any of that coming. Although, we probably should have."
Scandal,1,"For all of his brutal lessons, the one that ends up determining how Olivia's story comes to a close is that shunning love isn't the same as being heartless."
Scandal,1,It all worked out in the end ... sort of.
Scandal,1,"After seven seasons of rooting for Olivia Pope, even at her worst, it's nice to see her get the win."
Scandal,1,"Fun, silly addictive Scandal was also a serious and important part of TV history."
Scandal,1,"After 7 seasons, Scandal finally got real about racism."
Scandal,1,"I can already tell that Scandal's final season is going to feel like one long ""what if?"" episode - and I'm not mad about it at all."
Scandal,1,"Touch Marcus, touch."
Scandal,1,"Watch Me heralds the birth of a brand-new Olivia Pope, one far more willing to follow her darker impulses if she believes the ends justify the means."
Scandal,0,It's unsettling to follow - it doesn't feel like the same Scandal we've grown to love.
Scandal,1,I'm all for Olivia calling the shots. Kerry Washington is killing it.
Scandal,1,[Olivia's] speech is so fiery.
Scandal,1,"We were able to tune out the messy, real world for an hour, and we were better for it."
Scandal,1,Scandal has an opportunity to define its legacy.
Scandal,1,"So, this is it, y'all. The last first popcorn. The last first glass of red wine. The last first gasp when Huck does something absolutely insane."
Scandal,1,"As the season opener proved, Liv's exactly where she's always wanted to be-though perhaps not exactly with who she wanted to be with"
Devs,1,"A series that does what all the very best sci-fi stories do: tackle big existential questions and intimate everyday emotions in tandem, all while asking 'what if?'."
Devs,1,"While Devs is a vision of malevolent tech genius and power turned up to a preposterous degree, the sentiment is relevant. Human behavior can go as far as technological advance can take it, for better or worse."
Devs,1,"Idling probably isn't what Garland ultimately has in mind for his TV debut, of course, and his film resume suggests some fireworks will surface toward the end here...but Devs may sneakily be a big show..."
Devs,1,"Much like Garland's previous work, Devs will mess with your marbles and maybe even chill you to your bones."
Devs,1,Foster's scientific and philosophical theories keep us blued to the screen and entertained; Devs' futuristic and mysterious aesthetic keeps us hooked. [Full review in Spanish]
Devs,1,"With Ex-Machina and Annihilation, it will surely be one of the most memorable streaks in recent history, establishing Garland -- once and for all -- as one of the foremost voices in modern sci-fi"
Devs,1,Devs gives a grace and dignity to the apocalypse that you won't find in our own world.
Devs,1,It's as complex as an Alex Garland creation. But Devs once again proves that the mastermind behind tech thrillers is just beginning with his roster. [Full review in Spanish].
Devs,1,Alex Garland's latest mindbender is everything sci-fi television should be.
Devs,1,"Devs is a near-perfect companion piece to Ex_Machina, being a parable about the power of reason and imagination, and how the line into madness is easily crossed. Essential, if not easy, viewing."
Devs,1,Devs is dark as hell and I'm hooked.
Devs,1,Devs successfully allocates all of its storytelling devices to communicate the deeper questions of humanity and its place in the universe.
Devs,0,It was one of those dramas where Everyone. Spoke. Very. Slowly. In. The. Hope. Of. Appearing. Deep. When. What. They. Really. Were. Was. Lethally. Boring.
Devs,1,Thankfully Devs presents these mindbending ideas in a hugely entertaining and thrilling fashion.
Devs,1,"It's a deep, dark, wild ride. How much of it deals in pure imagination and how much of it is grounded in stuff already here I don't know. And please - nobody tell me. It's better this way."
Devs,0,"Devs deserves credit for throwing Big Themes up in the AI air and seeing where they land. But, and I'm misquoting the Marx Brothers here, deep down, Devs feels strangely superficial."
Devs,1,"The tone is paramount -- listen on headphones if possible. And the visuals are arresting. (If you must watch on a laptop, lie on the couch and put it on your chest.) It's a cerebral show, albeit one that just might get under the skin."
Devs,1,"Its ambition, design and cinematography are beyond almost anything else attempted for the small screen."
Devs,1,"If I've a complaint, beyond the pace, it's that [Alex] Garland is a tad too fond of weird lighting and disorientating ""ommm"" sounds when he has some heavy dramatic lifting to do."
Devs,0,"It's probably a Marmite drama, but in its preoccupation with being clever-clever and abstruse, it has made its characters too insipid and humourless to give a monkey's about."
Devs,1,Watching Devs I quickly learned it's possible to be entirely gripped by a show while simultaneously not having a clue what's going on.
Devs,1,"You would go into scenes genuinely unsure of their outcome, then realize Garland has led you to that single point all along. He makes the eight hours feel like an extended piece, flecked with cosmic wonder."
Devs,0,"While I can appreciate the stark beauty of the series, there is a pervading sense of dread that I found thoroughly unpleasant... Devs feels like the kind of show that will be a game-changer for many. But I'm not one of them."
Devs,1,"Beneath the high concepts lie the rawest, most basic of human emotions. Mizuno, warily composed one minute, snottily sobbing the next, is magnetic."
Devs,0,"It's the overdetermined plot that's leaving little room for the characters to develop... They lack warmth, wit and human singularity."
Devs,1,"Slow sci-fi puzzle box requires investment, has violence."
Devs,1,"Devs' magnetism is undeniable, and you feel yourself giving in even if you're completely lost"
Devs,1,"Devs is oblique and obsession-worthy sci-fi storytelling of the highest order, and that it somehow puts its characters first... speaks volumes about the human heat still rising, however improbably, from Garland's electric daydreams."
Devs,0,"The series's synthesis of aesthetic, plot, and subtext slowly starts to pull apart in its exposition-heavy second half."
Devs,1,"""Devs"" certainly slows itself down to create full portraits of each character, leaving you with a vibrant ensemble."
Devs,1,"If you're into sci-fi, and into Garland (and the latter kind of follows the former naturally), you'll be into Devs."
Devs,0,The mysteries of Devs don't unspool so much as eke out in a torturously slow drip. And the show's aesthetic details feel so detached from the story that they're often insufferable.
Devs,1,"Devs is a sci-fi detective story with a philosophical bent. And it balances those elements extremely well, even if it moves rather slowly."
Devs,1,"Even if it doesn't go as far as it could, Devs has a tight focus that makes it hypnotic, engrossing television, easy to slip into for an hour at a time or binge all at once if you wait."
Devs,1,"The secret project at the core of ""Devs"" is one of those things that's likely to stay with you and haunt you long after you've stopped watching."
Devs,1,"Devs is an exceptional television debut for Alex Garland, who has built a stunning world full of intrigue, strong characters to root for and against, and a mystery that will undoubtedly be the greatest aspect to unpack."
Devs,1,"Amid the glut of prestige TV, it turns out that a smart, experimental sci-fi show that knows entertainment value and depth aren't mutually exclusive still feels like something special."
Devs,1,"Overall, this was a very promising first episode, and it bodes well for the rest of the series."
Devs,0,"The problem, from a pure storytelling point of view, is that the show's tone, characters and narrative momentum have all surrendered to that same detached, emotionally isolated form of disaffection."
Devs,0,"Somewhere in Devs, there are relevant lessons to be learned about the misuse of technology and the age-old conflict between predestiny and free will... But this series is so hard to... decode that any of its deeper meanings get lost."
Devs,1,"Time and again in Devs, free will clashes with fate. Even if you were shown exactly what will happen in the next minute, the next hour, the next day, is there anything you could do to alter that timeline?"
Devs,1,"Garland has constructed another brilliant philosophical and existential mine field, a series that's as exciting to watch as it is to sit back and think about."
Devs,1,Garland has come to the small screen with a limited series that furthers the director's thoughts on technology while both failing as a television show and transcending the medium altogether.
Devs,0,It's interesting but wordy and perhaps better suited to film than TV considering the verbiage and slow pace.
Devs,1,"This is peak TV in all its decadence, methodically constructed like a medieval cathedral."
Devs,1,It draws you in.
Devs,1,It's a perfect example of why many of the best directors working today are preferring to migrate to the limitless horizons of streaming.
Devs,1,"If you love all things sci-fi, this is a show for you."
Devs,1,"Might not be an instant sci-fi classic, but a sci-fi classic it will surely one day be."
Devs,1,"Devs is an understated and complex journey. From the acting to the aesthetics to the overall themes, the miniseries creates a hypnotic, self-contained story that is absolutely worth the time and brainpower it will require from viewers."
Devs,1,...a mind-bending work of art for anyone willing to put in the demanding mental effort.
Devs,1,"The deliberately unbalanced feel of it might be off-putting... But I assure you, don't back off or you'll miss what is, for all of its aesthetically mesmerizing chill, a pretty damn engrossing modern horror story."
Devs,1,"A mind-blowing concept that doesn't entirely come together at the close, but which remains unsettling and provocative throughout."
Devs,1,[A] mostly well-plotted and delicately paced drip-feed of information.
Devs,1,"Devs moves a little slowly, but the performances are top-notch and the story is intriguing enough to put up with some of Garland's indulgences."
Devs,1,[Alex Garland's] work offers a bracing jolt that then lingers like a haunting.
Devs,1,"""Devs"" is quietly captivating and beautifully envisioned."
Devs,1,"Devs is groovy, quietcore sci-fi that hums with humanity, and at only eight-episodes it seems to be adequately paced, with little room to fail or flail."
Devs,1,"Come for atypical Offerman, and stick around for an FX show that's every bit as strange and unsettling as Garland fans would want it to be."
Devs,1,"Some will surely watch ""Devs"" twice. That's my prediction of the series' future, and I feel confident making it."
Devs,0,"The show is what it wants to be, but what it wants to be put me in mind of the big whiffs of the immediate post-Sopranos era, a hefty, pretentious, high-profile exercise in trying to make you Google de Broglie-Bohm theory."
Devs,1,"""Devs"" is a cerebral pleasure that gets very philosophical and presses its brainy atmosphere with lots of ponderous soundtrack music and deadpan acting."
Devs,1,"A quite fascinating, hypnotic series, with a couple of quite amazing moments and, in general, recommendable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Devs,1,"I'm still not sure I know what the point of the Devs project is, but I loved watching Devs unfold."
Devs,1,"Devs has the ingredients to shepherd a faithful following, yet watching it can feel like work. It's not necessarily the kind of program you want to tune to after a long tiresome day."
Devs,1,"Personally, I found that ending a little empty and unsatisfying. Yet I didn't regret going on the haunting philosophical forest walk it took to get there."
Devs,1,"Plenty of shows offer accomplished style or gripping drama or an original, politically relevant concept, but you rarely get to have all three at once."
Devs,1,"Filmmaker Alex Garland kills it once again with ""Devs,"" a dramatic thriller, that returns to the ideas of A.I., only now developed to quantum proportions."
Devs,1,A daring and new deconstruction of one of the basic tenets of human existence.
Devs,1,Devs is a remarkable study on loss and grief that illustrates how emotional attachment and technological advancements can cause dangerous implications when in the hands of the wrong person.
Devs,1,"Instead of big revelations, he adds more layers that are meant to enhance our understanding of the philosophical matters he's laid out; the picture isn't expanded so much as brought into sharper focus."
Devs,1,"As Devs glides to its ominous and possibly predestined climax, Mizuno artfully underplays Lily's quiet panic when she finds herself trapped in a scenario worthy of Black Mirror."
Devs,0,"Of course the characters don't have free will. That would require imagination, something Devs can only simulate."
Devs,1,"What I love most about the show is that it tackles wonky, philosophical sci-fi tropes in wonderfully unpredictable ways."
Devs,1,"In our world, things might get a little messier, a little bleaker; but no less interesting, for better or worse. Devs has its elements of mess, all carefully cultivated by Garland to up the stakes, and some of them are haunting."
Devs,0,"Even with a pretty fantastic penultimate episode, it becomes much more a garden maze -- unsure of where it really wants to go."
Devs,0,"Garland's vision is in the forefront here, and the result is a limited series with a frosty emotional tone, and a story heavy on cutting-edge techno-speak, but skimpy when it comes to characterization."
Devs,1,Devs emerges as an indisputably stunning mystery.
Devs,1,"It's haunting and hypnotic, a show of marrow-seeping mood and a unity of vision that carries through every frame. If it also turns a corner from entrancingly opaque to a bit on-the-nose by the end... chances are that you'll be too absorbed to be bothered."
Devs,1,"Patient fans who enjoyed Garland's film work will find a lot to like about Devs, even if their attention may wane at times."
Devs,1,"You need to study Devs - every frame might be giving you an answer. Or it might not. Part of the fun of this show is getting wrapped-up in its mind-blowing originality. For better or worse, Devs is a show that stands almost entirely on its own."
Devs,1,DEVS will haunt you long after you finish it and the fact you cannot binge all eight episodes at once means you will savor each twist and turn as the mystery unfolds over the next two months. Get ready for one of the best shows of 2020.
Devs,1,Devs is as weird as they come and will hit the spot of those looking for a series such as it to fill the void left by the conclusion of Mr. Robot.
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
Devs,1,"The slow pace of the early episodes are almost entirely forgiven once you get to the truly arresting visuals of the latter half of the series, and how they recontextualize our world."
Devs,1,Fans of Ex Machina and Annihilation will easily recognize the landscapes and tenor of FX's Devs as Alex Garland's creation without his name even scrolling across the screen.
Devs,0,"It has [Alex] Garland's signature chilly and cerebral tone, but the pacing is sluggish."
Devs,1,"Devs is also downright gorgeous to look at, alternately vibrant and stark, earthy and modernistic, and jam-packed with striking imagery that sears right into your brain."
Devs,1,"Garland uses his time wisely, and his beautiful vision of a ghastly future is undeniably insightful. Some of its ideas may not be welcome - they sure as shit aren't comforting - but ""Devs"" sticks with you, whether you want it to or not."
Devs,1,"While, overall, Devs tells a compelling story, it will leave you wanting a lot more, from the story itself and the character development. Garland probably could have used help in navigating TV structure."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"There are fireworks here, but the peripheral characters and their unravelling lives are the ones that are more likely to stay with you."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"In the end, the show does more than make room for a shift in Elena's worldview. It also registers just how much this sliver of hope has cost the more marginalized others in her life."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"...gets at the heart of America's denial of the importance of race and class in everyday life, with a lesser nod to how gender (particularly the inability to control one's fertility) shapes women's lives."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires everywhere's own tragic structure becomes like a tumor, victim of its own rules, and much of what could be left to subtext ends up revealing itself in the most explicit and forced fashion [ Full review in spanish]"
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"This overly dramatic exposure of americana stays calmly in its conflict, but guarantees an effective show with enough social commentary even when it's not relevant. [Full review in Spanish]."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere digs so deeply and powerfully into motherhood - along with all the judgment, guilt and failings that are part of the experience - that it hurts."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,The cast here is fantastic (the kids are unbelievably good) and it's packed with clever detail.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"This is, in fact, one of the best performances of Witherspoon's career. It's doubtful there's a more self-aware actress in Hollywood, or one who is better at challenging our expectations even as she is meeting them."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Sometimes the social concerns feel too billboard-obvious, but on the upside, the piece exerts a soapy but tenacious grip, and there's buckets of strong acting from the ensemble."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Throw in some classic era-setting choice cuts from the '90s (think Annie Lennox and Counting Crows) and the result is an engaging, addictive, drama-filled watch."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"It looks expensive enough, if you're in the market for bland Pottery Barn interiors and blazers with gold buttons. But, boy, is it boring, a tedium that is the result both of the hackneyed way that character is signalled, and its improbable plot."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"The series is superbly cast, with Washington portraying awe-inspiring tension and restraint as Mia, and Witherspoon who... leans into her own white privilege as Elena to show - rather than tell - its insidious nature."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Moreish, searing, excellent. What it is not is nuanced."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"This Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington co-production ticks many boxes, thanks to its ability to meld comedy, teen drama and a stark portrayal of class inequality."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Despite its issues, 'Little Fires Everywhere' has a powerful script and is full of memorable moments. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"The merits of creator Liz Tigelaar are present in the exploration of the aspects that are barely suggested in Celeste Ng's novel, as well as in the decision to make some strategic changes and to connect the story with the present. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere is a miniseries that's arresting and beguiling, thanks to its strong lead performances and a smart, insightful story."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Some actors do certain types of roles so exquisitely that you can happily watch them do it over and over. Two of these actors are Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's difficult to turn away from due to just how incredibly nuanced the performances of [Reese] Witherspoon and [Kerry] Washington are.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's written and directed with a sure touch.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"At just eight episodes, it doesn't demand a huge commitment, and while it's highly bingeable, it has plenty of real substance, too. Each episode ends so enticingly poised that it's hard not to let the next one play."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Though the series has its missteps, lacking the novel's gentle nuance and oscillating in tone between ""soap opera"" and ""intro to women's studies course,"" it sometimes succeeds at this mission..."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"There's a lot of missteps on the show that make its fires go out quickly. From its aggressive ambitions to tackle a lot of things to its unsubtle and heavy-handed melodrama approach, Little Fires Everywhere obviously suffers from most of it."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little Fires Everwhere is not a great series; it's also a pale shadow of the source material. However, it is never boring.The performances are not nuanced, but they are entertaining."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's a show that's sometimes funny, sometimes, touching, often disturbing, and almost always hard to look away from except in horror."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Shenanigans aside, what makes Little Fires Everywhere perfect for our current, stranger-than-fiction moment is the ordinariness of the lives it presents."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Race and class issues erupt in thoughtful, mature drama."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Elena is thinly drawn as an obviously villainous ""white savior"" and Witherspoon is repeating her performance from Big Little Lies with less nuance and shading."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Megan Stott's portrayal of Izzy is dynamic and provoking. Stott brings about a vulnerable and yet fierce side to the character that is intriguing to watch and feels completely believable for teenage rebellion.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"While Little Fires Everywhere has its sights set squarely on being a withering takedown of petty suburban class dynamics, it's also remarkably understanding of the people within it."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"The series isn't as stellar as the best-selling novel it adapts, and Reese was even better in Big Little Lies. Still, it's worth a watch."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's one iconic actress acting against type, and another shading what she does best. For all the imperfections and missteps in adapting the source material, these lead performances are what light the match. It's the fire you tune in to see burn."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"[It] doesn't seem able to trust Witherspoon to convince viewers to appreciate or like Elena on her own strengths, even though watching [her] paste a sunny smile over a casually terrible statement is the deepest and purest pleasure [It] has to offer."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"""On the nose"" casting or not...there's something to be said in very good actresses taking a pitch, right in their wheelhouse, and belting it."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"More than Little Fires Everywhere's soapy and somewhat predictable twists and turns, it is the interplay between its two leads that generates the most worthwhile heat."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"This could have been the second genuinely remarkable series for Hulu. Instead it remains stuck in second gear, with many episodes feeling longer than they are as Elena's upsetting choices endlessly pile on."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Fires is basically a two-actress showcase for Witherspoon and Scandal's Kerry Washington. In other words, think of this eight-episode series as Medium Little Lies. But its stars make it very watchable."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's all very well acted by a superb cast that makes the material engaging. Just because it's familiar doesn't mean it loses relevancy or purpose.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's addictive and highly enjoyable, and a tad triggering -- but, you know, in a healthy and cleansing kind of way."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"What do you get when you mix bold storytelling, uncomfortable truths, and vital life lessons with equal parts Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon? Magic. Pure magic."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"[A] show that deftly dissects which women are afforded the luxury to make choices and to make compromises, and how their lives are shaped by that luxury or the lack of it."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"It focuses too much on tiresome suburban ennui to be anything more than fleetingly interesting, despite excellent performances from Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Little Fires Everywhere is still compulsively watchable and reasonably well-made. It's only frustrating to see the assembled potential and know it could have been better.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"This one feels just unsteady enough that if it doesn't land on a coherent final chord, it won't hold together as a whole. The caliber of performers and the strength of the source material makes me optimistic."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Clumsy dialogue aside, ""Little Fires Everywhere"" is entertaining as a high-end soap opera driven by star power, a little bit of mystery and lots of '90s pop culture references."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Subtle and not-so-subtle themes of institutional racism and class warfare are in the forefront throughout ""Little Fires Everywhere."""
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere has issues, but it's a very watchable show that should be buoyed by Witherspoon's and Washington's performances."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,It's a busy and reasonably intriguing story if you skate over its less convincing twists. And it benefits from excellent work by Washington and Underwood.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"If the series had scaled back some of its theatrics to be more subtle, I think it would've packed a much harder punch. I don't need characters screaming at each other every other scene; I need them to be saying something of interest."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington give some of their best performances to date as two mothers who are trying, desperately, to do what's best for their children."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere is one of those rare multi-generational dramas where the arcs involving the kids are every bit as good as the adults, as the conflicts gradually build."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"There is no shortage of things to criticize, but like ""Lies,"" it's hard not to watch."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,The fascinating part of the show is watching these two women come together - whether that means their ideals colliding or finding common ground.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"While Little Fires is more soap opera than art, it redeems the form with its vivid characters and their outsized, reality-adjacent lives."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"""Little Fires Everywhere"" isn't exactly subtle in highlighting Elena's blindness to how condescending she is, but the series is smart enough not to make Elena an outright villain."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere becomes, ultimately, a referendum on motherhood filtered through middlebrow drama - the choices mothers make, the worlds they do or do not provide, the secrets they keep, the control they want and increasingly can't have."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere is an effective, well-acted drama with some moments of real depth. Those moments of real depth just made me wish it achieved such moments more consistently."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"""Little Fires Everywhere"" lands with confidence between the allure of prestige streaming television and a Shonda Rhimes-like propensity for soap suds."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Writer Liz Tigelaar explores a lot of interesting questions about motherhood and racial appropriation, and the supporting actors are all excellent, even as their characters are, by design, eclipsed by Elena and Mia."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Not everything burns equally bright in this twisty saga... But any time the moms step into the spotlight - Rosemarie DeWitt is also terrific as a desperately needy adoptive mother - Fires scorches with emotional intensity.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere offers an at-times fascinating exploration of parenting, privilege, motherhood, even womanhood, but its overall message is clear: Eventually, parents just have to let go."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"The adapted Little Fires Everywhere does contain enough bad behavior to make it a guilty pleasure. Even if guilt is the principal ingredient that the show is missing, and to a fatal degree."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Even when Little Fires isn't at its best, it's hard to tear your eyes away from its leads."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Little Fires Everywhere tells a powerful story of the haves and the have nots while refusing to settle for oversimplified comparisons or hollow allegory.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"What's frustrating about Little Fires Everywhere is that the discrepancy between the novel and the miniseries implies that A-list actors are all the show has to offer, when what should really shine is Ng's wise, haunting story."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,Its proclivities towards suburban mom soap-opera-y melodrama in favor of something as thoughtful as its emotionally intelligent social topics are so undermining and blazingly frustrating at times.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"In its best moments, the series resists drawing clear lines between who's right and who's wrong."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"""Fires"" burns bright in its first episode and beyond, promising an engrossing, fast-moving, character-driven drama that becomes deeper and more disturbing as the story unspools."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"It's sweet, it goes down easily, and it doesn't challenge you nearly as much as maybe it should."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Little Fires Everywhere is rarely provocative. But not for nothing, it's better at engaging with race and class than Big Little Lies was."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Washington is fantastic as Mia. Her hard, angry exterior barely conceals her vulnerability. She's a fiercely protective mother who may not always make the best choices but always wants what is right."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Its story plays out the debate, but its form is firmly on Witherspoon's side. In the main, this is a show too aware of its pedigree and its importance to drive home its arguments with anything but the most earnest sort of gravity."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"Its exploration of why women often feel more alienated from than connected to one another is far from lean-in aspirational, but at least it's honest."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,There's also a rich and satisfying teen drama nestled inside Little Fires' saga of adult ennui.
Little Fires Everywhere,1,"""Fires"" doesn't need a lot of extra trimming to make its viewers' hearts race. The series has the rare ability to make the mundane simply mesmerizing."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu's adaptation is a resounding disappointment, considering the star power behind it - a flat, formulaic melodrama that hits all the wrong notes."
Little Fires Everywhere,1,Hulu's Little Fires Everywhere is squarely aimed folks with a Big Little Lies-shaped hole in their lives.
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"True crime buffs, this one's for you."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"There's a lot to like in the second half of the season, but the buy-in requires you to move through some weaker material."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"The Most Dangerous Animal Of All is intriguing enough to spend three-and-a-half hours on, but you may find yourself wondering why this story couldn't have been told in half the time."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"That's the problem with The Most Dangerous Animal of All: Earl Van Best Jr. never comes into focus, and the Zodiac Killer doesn't either."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,His (Director Kief Davidson) team also does what Stewart's publisher... apparently never did: fact-check his assertions. It's in those verifications that the documentary justifies its existence.
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"The Most Dangerous Animal of All examines how Stewart's quest for his true identity never fully satisfies him, and comes at the cost of several relationships, including multiple marriages."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"FX's first true crime series brings a new type of grossness to the genre - one in which the audience feels shameful simply because viewing the docuseries makes us complicit in stroking the ego of its subject, Gary L. Stewart."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"Its four-episode counts makes it an easy investment, one whose ultimate turn is bizarre but feels like a perfect fit for this strange case's natural twists."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"The series twists and turns in unexpected ways, becoming more of a commentary on how much his case foments obsession than anything else."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"For those looking for a character study of the lifelong effects of abandonment, The Most Dangerous Animal of All is a must-watch."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,"...it turns the entire affair into a critique of both itself and, by extension, the true-crime genre, where sensational claims and pretzel-logic explanations are routinely, and easily, presented as trustworthy."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,1,A solid entry into the true-crime docu-series genre from a network not that accustomed to doing this kind of storytelling.
"Roswell, New Mexico",0,"For a show with a stellar cast and a wide array of fascinating characters, it still struggles to get it right after all these years."
The X-Files,0,"As brilliant as Dana Scully was, and as badly as young women needed her, she remained frustratingly beyond the grasp of the men who wrote her."
The X-Files,1,"it seems that this time they are not in a hurry, and that at some point they have breathed, reflected on what they want to offer the public. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The X-Files,1,"This season, the series, which turns 25 in September, rolls out current news images - North Korea and President Trump, among them - to remind us of those dangers. Still, it doesn't let that overpower the basic appeal of the show."
The X-Files,1,Early episodes seem stronger this time around with some added timeliness - Russians infiltrating the U.S. government! - and a major mythology reveal in the first episode back.
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
The X-Files,1,"Fortunately, the follow-up season is a vast improvement."
The X-Files,0,"I'm glad Gillian Anderson isn't coming back for next season because if this is the direction the show is taking us, it's time for it to end."
The X-Files,1,"I think they're good enough, and entertaining enough, that I hope more episodes of The X-Files will be produced. To quote Mulder's poster: ""I want to believe."""
The X-Files,1,"It's hard not to be uplifted by Mulder's rambling about hellhounds, the underworld, magic protection circles, and the like, all for Scully's signature eye roll and sigh."
The X-Files,0,It's time for the veteran creator to let others find the truth out there.
The X-Files,1,"Happily, with episode one out of the way, The X-Files clicks back into groove, swiftly reminding us why we all loved it so much in the first place."
The X-Files,0,"Once we were charmed by this gloriously imaginative fiction, but with this latest iteration Chris Carter has only managed to weave a tapestry of unparalleled nonsense."
The X-Files,1,"Certainly if you are among those of us who will never stop wanting to believe, more time with our beloved alien chasers as they trade barbs while battling beasties is always cause for celebration."
The X-Files,0,"And if you are not already a fan, there is no good reason to watch Season 11. The opening episode verged on soap opera, bloated with cringey dialogue and breathy conspiracies."
The X-Files,1,"Season 11... is still uneven, but far more satisfying than the warmed-over mysteries of last season."
The X-Files,1,... a chance to make the show relevant to a new generation of viewers who aren't watching out of nostalgia or habit.
The X-Files,0,"If only Fox would do us a favor and stop bringing this one back. Fans get their hopes up, only to see them crushed again."
The X-Files,1,"It's a pleasant, clever, and sometimes inspired reunion with old friends who were right on the verge of wearing out their welcome when they suddenly reminded you of all the reasons why you loved them in the first place."
The X-Files,1,"It comes off less as an exercise in brand revival and more a genuine new season of ""The X-Files."""
The X-Files,1,"As agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson continue to sporadically exhibit those qualities that made the series pop, from his droll asides to her intensity and skepticism."
The X-Files,1,"Duchovny and Anderson still share mad chemistry and, as a bereft mother, Anderson can be downright haunting."
The X-Files,1,"Indeed, as time goes by, it's somewhat more fun to just appreciate the actors: Mulder and Scully remain fixed in their philosophical positions and reactions to various wild events, but Anderson and Duchovny have become more subtle performers."
The X-Files,1,"When The X-Files isn't diving into bottomless rabbit holes of overlapping and pretentiously mystifying conspiracy theories, it can still be great, spooky fun nearly a quarter-century since its debut."
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
The X-Files,0,"The adjustments made for the opening episode show less of the kind of creative skills that made episodes like ""Triangle,"" ""Home"" and ""Ice"" so memorable and come across as a uninspired solution to what looked like an unfixable situation."
The X-Files,1,"The stand-alone ""monster of the week"" episodes are more enjoyable, and truer to the show's most successful element, and the weird playful ones, at least the one included in the critics' sampler, shine most brightly of all."
The X-Files,0,"A lot of the return to night is devoted to chase scenes and makes one appreciate by comparison how much better a reboot ""Twin Peaks"" was last year."
The X-Files,1,"Now more than ever, The X-Files functions best when it keeps its focus narrow and wipes the slate from week to week. That's the way we're all coping: Trying not to think about our last episode. Or, scarier still, our next."
The X-Files,1,True believers who have devoured most if not all of the 208 previous episodes likely will find it thrilling simply to be strung along anew.
The X-Files,1,The X-Files is shockingly relevant again and tackling current affairs better than it did in its original run and has a lot of fun doing it.
The X-Files,1,"Just like the best seasons of this show, Season 11 will keep you off-balance about what kind of episode you're going to get, but Anderson and Duchovny-still game for freaky fun after all these years-are there to guide you through the dark."
The X-Files,1,"The X-Files still produces excellent stand-alone TV episodes -- tremendously entertaining hours with the show's familiar blend of spookiness, self-deprecating humor and cleverly conceptual in-jokes that only the initiated can really appreciate."
The X-Files,1,"These new episodes will make you remember fondly how it all was, in a way I never would have expected given how the previous batch turned out."
The X-Files,1,"After a ragged start, X gets down to business, and the result is mostly pleasurable."
The X-Files,1,"Since the show is Chris Carter's baby and he isn't going anywhere or loosening up on the reins, you either find the bursts of inspiration and spookiness worth the plodding stretches of perfunctory mythology or you don't."
The X-Files,1,"The 2016 six-episode revival was solid, but Season 11 really hits its stride, flexing the full range of X-Files muscles (horror, sci-fi, mystery, comedy, romance) and fully embracing its aging heroes and place in the age of fake news."
The X-Files,1,The first return felt like the show was relearning to walk; now it's off and running.
The X-Files,1,The X-Files Season 11 seems intent on proving the benefits that come with age and experience. It's succeeding.
The X-Files,1,Things do indeed get to a place of wonder by the mid-point of the season.
The X-Files,1,"Season 11 so far isn't flawless, but it's a lively, character-focused affair that feels far more unified than we'd ever anticipated, a massive improvement over Season 10 that gives us genuine hope for the second half."
You're the Worst,1,"The perfect ending, for our favorite perfectly imperfect couple."
You're the Worst,1,"All I asked for was that You're the Worst not ruin itself in its last season. What I got was a finale that quickly rocketed to my all-time favorite show ending ever (sorry, Six Feet Under)."
You're the Worst,1,"It's a fitting send-off for a show that is ending at the right time; truly, there's only so much more deplorable behavior from these Californians that we could happily continue to tolerate."
You're the Worst,1,"There's definitely more going on in ""You're the Worst"" than clever put-downs and romantic sentimentality, though."
You're the Worst,1,As a 1990s romance this story hits every note like a decent cover song.
You're the Worst,1,"The gambit in ""The Intransigence of Love"" is one of the show's best to date."
You're the Worst,1,"If nothing else, [the premiere] shows that just because the series is in its last season, it doesn't mean that it has any intention of slowing down or to stopping being the weird little show we all love."
You're the Worst,1,"[Jimmy and Gemma] will definitely be put through the ringer this season as they plan their wedding, but Falk gives them the reprieve they deserve in the premiere... It's the beginning of the end of their love story."
You're the Worst,1,"What I will tell you is that this show, which for years took every possible stab it could at the callow selfishness of its characters, ends up embracing them with empathy and understanding."
You're the Worst,1,"Throughout, Season 5 celebrates every aspect of what's made the series a standout -- especially its cast."
You're the Worst,1,"It's scathingly funny, but also acutely sad. Though the show is mostly rooting for Jimmy and Gretchen to get over themselves and make it work, it also doesn't run from the idea that neither can be their best so long as they're with the other."
You're the Worst,1,"Cribbing heavily from movies like High Fidelity, Notting Hill, even Weird Science... and somehow garnering an appropriate, heartfelt emotional response when the time is right."
You're the Worst,1,Stephen Falk's sharp comedy is rounded out by Kether Donohue and Desmin Borges.
Friday Night Lights,1,"Much like Mike Judge's King of the Hill, I appreciate Friday Night Lights' commitment to place and the specification of character in a rural Texas suburb."
Friday Night Lights,1,"While the finale contained some major developments, it was the little things that made every moment so resonant and real, including every gorgeously rendered detail in that closing montage."
Friday Night Lights,1,It was perfect.
Friday Night Lights,1,Friday Night Lights ends with clear eyes and a full heart; everyone wins.
Friday Night Lights,1,It's a bittersweet ending for the show and viewers.
Friday Night Lights,1,"Friday Night Lights, at its best, was utterly unique viewing, gut-rattling and occasionally almost suffocating. Like family, it could leave you smiling or sobbing. Or, on occasion, both."
Friday Night Lights,1,It's great to see a show bow out on such a strong note and not outstay its welcome.
Friday Night Lights,1,"The people of Dillon show us the best in ourselves, and if that's the definition of predictable, then TV is sorely lacking in predictable fare, and the end of Friday Night Lights will be felt for years to come."
Friday Night Lights,1,"The difference between Friday Night Lights and so many other humdrum, forgettable ""soft"" dramas is the strength of the writing, the believability of the actors and characters they play, and ultimately, how effectively it's all put together."
Friday Night Lights,1,"Overall, it's just wonderful that this amazing series defied the odds to have the run it did and is going out with its head held high - as it should be."
Friday Night Lights,1,...a legitimately brilliant drama...
Friday Night Lights,1,"This season may be about saying goodbyes, but for now I'm just happy to have Friday Night Lights back."
Friday Night Lights,1,What's most remarkable about Friday Night Lights (outside of the quality of the writing and acting on the actual program) is how the show survived.
Friday Night Lights,1,Even an episode that has all of the excitement of new beginnings still managed to tug at my heartstrings.
Friday Night Lights,1,I'm generally impressed with how well the final season wrapped up.
Friday Night Lights,1,"Just watch the first two episodes and you will think one word (""Touchdown!"") and remain emotionally riveted for the remaining 11 episodes of the final season."
Friday Night Lights,1,"In the end, Friday Night Lights managed to create striking moments out of the small and intimate... Texas forever, indeed."
Friday Night Lights,1,"I measure the quality of each episode based on my tear and cheer count, and this episode proved high in both. Ah, Dillon, Texas. How I have missed you."
Friday Night Lights,1,"Man, that was one fine, emotional, intelligent, and satisfying ending."
Friday Night Lights,1,"As always, it's good to be back in Dillon."
Friday Night Lights,1,"The series has several faults, but its strange concoction of emotions makes for some seriously compelling television."
Friday Night Lights,1,"While this season's arc may be presented too broadly, with a cast this strong it's difficult not to become ensnared in the raw emotions of Dillon, Texas."
Friday Night Lights,1,"For a show whose ratings never justified a second season, five seasons is an achievement to celebrate."
Friday Night Lights,1,"The show, and its survival, offers proof that quality can triumph in an industry driven by quantity and that even though necessity is the more fertile of the two, poetry can also be a fine mother to invention."
Friday Night Lights,1,"This is a show that's scored way more than it has faltered, and the opening episode suggests that streak will continue."
Friday Night Lights,1,"This show went to places that most shows aren't brave enough to go. For that reason, it'll forever be in the 'win' column."
Friday Night Lights,1,"This is a place, and a show, I will never want to leave. It feels like family. But we're lucky to have been given this much of their story. Underdogs to the end, these are my TV heroes."
24,1,"As long as all you ask of it is more familiar twists and backstabbing, you'll probably be happy with it."
24,1,"The shorter season meant a tighter and better-told story, and less time to get lost in the woods (perhaps literally) with lame characters or D-plots that had no real impact on the people who everyone in the audience cared about."
24,1,"In fact, it's difficult to think of anything the comeback did wrong, other than making me wish they were going to make another season."
24,0,Is this a series too far?
24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.
24,1,"Our hero returns! And there is no stopping him. He just beats everyone up. Boom, boom, shaka laka, boom!"
24,1,"It's hard not to want more. Four years of being clean, then a double hit - hmmm, that's good - and yeah, I'm back too."
24,1,A consolation then that 24 doesn't have any of draggy stuff that so quickly palled Homeland's charms; there are no stroppy teenagers in Jack's world.
24,1,"Even with its five-minute commercial breaks, 24: Live Another Day is much better than anyone could have expected, and promises to bring some zing to TV's spring."
24,1,"Jack indeed returned in the show's debut episode Monday night, reminding me of all the reasons I used to devote an hour a week to the action-packed show."
24,1,The details are no more believable or credible than they ever were. But since when did any of that matter? The result is still pretty entertaining.
24,1,"Let's hope that the shorter season will allow the writers to keep it simpler and stronger. After seeing the first two episodes, we gotta trust them."
24,1,"It's always good to see an old friend, and an old pro in action. Live Another Day gives us both."
24,1,Half the hours. Twice the mayhem.
24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters."
24,1,It is sort of brilliant that 24: Live Another Day takes place in the UK.
24,1,"Detractors will say Day 9 repeats the same old formula from eight seasons of 24 as if that's a bad thing. Sure, it's familiar-but like a roller coaster you refuse to quit, it's a wildly entertaining, addictive thrill ride."
24,1,"After a four-year absence, 24 is back, and its return couldn't be more welcome."
24,1,"I can't imagine how [it] looks to a novice viewer, but as a longtime fan who came to embrace the show's ridiculous core, it's slightly thrilling to slip back into the old rhythms, to feel my pulse quicken in time with that accelerating countdown."
24,1,"24: Live Another Day seeks to prove that less is more, slowly revving up the comfortably formulaic engine while visceral split-screen editing once again intensifies the literally explosive twists."
24,1,"Damn it, Jack and Chloe! It's good to see both of you back on my television screen again."
24,1,"In this universe, that so resembles yours, there's no option for being cast out, for remaining out, that choices cannot be made, but are only made for [Chloe] and Jack Bauer and you, too."
24,0,This abbreviated 12-episode revival may be an improvement because of the way it galvanizes the pace. Turns out Jack didn't need a whole day to save our bacon.
24,1,Maybe absence really does make the heart grow fonder. I couldn't even begin to miss Jack until he went away.
24,1,Live Another Day's drone story extends Bush-era mechanized warfare into the age of Obama. It's another example of 24's knack for mixing left- and right-wing assumptions into a ferocious action film cocktail.
24,1,"As an optimist and a fan of the original series, the suspenseful and action-packed first two hours of 24: Live Another Day give me hope that we're not only seeing Jack Bauer's big comeback, but 24's as well. The clock is ticking and we're ready."
24,1,"This is one of those rare cases when the same old, same old isn't such a bad thing, especially if you love 24. All the elements are there - conspiracy within conspiracy, intense action, and, of course, the whole real time thing."
24,1,"Ultimately, the particulars of 24's new normal don't really matter. All that matters is Jack is back. For the first two hours, it feels like he never left."
24,1,"Cool as it is to see Jack back in shoot-'em-up mode, the figure who caught my attention in the first two episodes was a new face: Yvonne Strahovski as disgraced CIA agent Kate Morgan."
24,1,It's good kinetic fun that makes up for the show's narrative shorthand.
24,1,"Having long since proven that they can indeed fill 24 episodes with action, cutting it in half gives the creators the chance to cut the fat and deliver a lean, mean ride."
24,1,"I'm ready to watch one more adventure story about the man who can save us from evil, even if the man, and the premise, feel like refugees from a bloody fairy tale."
24,1,"The action-packed but still mostly brainless thriller is back, and as long as the series has no pretension to greatness, it's a lot of fun."
24,1,"There are reasons we still love 24, despite the gaps in logic, the repetitious dialogue, the monotonously unrelenting tension and some wooden acting. It's the combination of action and character."
24,1,"The best news is, you don't have to be a 24 diehard -- or have encyclopedic knowledge of all things Jack Bauer -- to enjoy 24: Live Another Day."
24,1,"It was worth the wait, and the wait was good all around."
24,1,24 is as much a thrill ride as ever.
24,0,"The Jack-as-wounded-hero archetype had been wrung dry long ago, and Live Another Day does nothing to find new life for it."
24,1,"The first two episodes are a welcome invitation to the same old song and dance, but everyone involved will need to freshen up the choreography."
24,1,The cat-and-mouse thriller that helped launch television's binge-watching craze when it debuted in 2001 remains as endearingly implausible as ever.
24,1,"As always, one of the chief pleasures of watching 24 is seeing Kiefer Sutherland essay the role of Jack. His portrayal of the man makes him deadly serious but stays on the right side of camp at all times."
24,0,"This time it is far less potent. At 47, Sutherland wears Jack's evident fatigue (and extra wrinkles) like a badge, even though the script never gives him much to work with in the way of emotion or depth."
24,1,"Jack will have his work cut out for him, and audiences will be as enthralled by 24 as they have ever been, if not more, and they'll have good reason."
24,1,"A good opening salvo for what will probably be Jack's last day, at least on TV. Enjoy it while you can -- and it is enjoyable."
24,1,"It's the middle-to-late hours where 24 so often succumbs to lame twists and wild leaps of implausibility. That's why a 12-episode edition of 24, at this stage, seems enticing."
24,0,"While the format has been altered a bit... this new season is 12 episodes instead of 24 so some hours will be skipped -- everything else about the show is same-old, same-old."
24,1,The producers have so embraced the larger-than-life elements of their beloved character that it's hard not to enjoy the show on those terms. We needed a hero in 2001. Maybe we need a superhero in 2014.
24,1,All the familiar elements are in place.
24,0,"Despite the high-grade action, the premiere is more a showcase for everything that was bad about 24 than a reminder of everything that was good."
24,0,This 24 revival seems motivated by more pragmatic and mercenary considerations: trying to wring a few more nuggets out of a played-out goldmine.
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
24,1,"In Live Another Day, time is allowed to pass between some episodes, resulting in a tighter, more action-packed storyline."
24,1,"The reason to watch 24: Live Another Day isn't for ideology. It's to get caught up in a fast-paced, high-powered adventure played out by people we care about."
24,1,"For fans who stuck around for all eight original seasons, Live Another Day offers more of what they loved. For everyone else, there's no reason to start now."
24,1,"The clock is once again ticking, but it's unclear who or what is at stake - and that's a very good thing."
The Son,1,"It's a thoroughly decent exploration of the contest between ethics and burgeoning power, as well as a war of wills between a messed-up, morally ""flexible"" patriarch and his progeny."
The Son,1,"This is character driven action driving character, and truly artistic storytelling. It stays small, plays large."
Shadowhunters,1,The Final Hunt is going to be a ride.
Shadowhunters,1,"It's going to be a bumpy road ahead for everyone, I can feel it."
Shadowhunters,1,"All in all, not the most exciting season premiere in the history of television. But that's okay because there's plenty of material to work with and room for the stories to grow."
Shadowhunters,1,"As for the loves of my life, aka Magnus and Alec, I'm so happy that we're getting to see their relationship develop more."
Shadowhunters,1,"Shadowhunters may have given us a pretty dark episode, what with Jace turning out to be the person under the Owl's mysterious mask all along - more on that later - but at least it was tempered with some adorable domestic Malec moments."
Shadowhunters,1,Lilith's disciples could be the toughest enemies the group has had to fight yet.
The Strain,1,The fallout has happened and Dr. Goodweather has lost. This is a good starting point after three seasons of the same thing.
The Strain,1,"The Strain proved rewarding in its finality, allowing characters who had endured the threat, lost loved ones and bravely faced a supernatural foe a hard-earned ray of hope."
The Strain,1,"This is what it's like to see The Strain firing on all cylinders, finally."
The Strain,1,"Unequivocally, the fourth and final season of The Strain has been the show's best."
The Strain,1,"Most of the worst aspects of this episode were things that have annoyed me throughout the series. And yet, there were plenty of facets of the series finale that worked really well"
The Strain,1,"But the series found its way back to top form in its final season, its bleakest yet, as the characters reckoned with their own fates after a disaster left them ostracized from each other and utterly hopeless."
The Strain,1,"It's obvious that all of the core cast members are spread out all over the place, but are still in touch to some degree, with each working towards a specific goal."
The Strain,1,"Indeed, it feels like the show is preparing to tie everything together into a satisfying end that rewards all who stuck it out for the four year run."
The Strain,1,"The Strain, created by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan and run by the longtime producer Carlton Cuse, is a prime example of traditional, meticulous craftsmanship and slow-building suspense."
The Strain,1,"With the end finally on the horizon, there's a sense that because it's all coming to an end anyway, The Strain can finally throw caution to the wind and really let its freak flag fly."
The Strain,1,"While fairly slow starting out, The Strain's fourth season eventually built to a satisfying conclusion as it rearranged the playing field and explored the far-reaching effects of the Master's rise to power."
The Strain,1,"The Strain's final season is focused and fierce, with opening episodes that plant seeds for stomach-turning strigoi showdowns and heartbreaking character collisions all the way down the line to the vampire saga's highly anticipated finale."
A Teacher,1,"Teacher-student affairs are often portrayed as sexy, salacious scandals. A Teacher gets that they're really about abuse of power."
A Teacher,1,"Kate Mara's work... is interesting, because it gives her character a humanity that is difficult to construct as long as she is aware from which place the viewer perceives her. [Full review in Spanish]"
A Teacher,1,A Teacher is generally engaging and more rewarding if you stick with it to the end.
A Teacher,0,I can't help thinking A Teacher might have imparted its lesson better if it weren't quite so enraptured of the affair too.
A Teacher,1,"Maybe A Teacher will stir awareness of the insidious patterns of abuse, but its storytelling doesn't rise to the complexity of its subject matter."
A Teacher,1,"A Teacher's subject matter won't be for everyone - it rightly comes with a grooming warning - but if you're a fan of sensitively handled, superbly paced, suspense-filled drama, then you'll likely be quickly hooked."
A Teacher,0,t's a shame because those scenes show that the series is capable of good visual storytelling. So it just makes the whole experience worse when you realize the missed potential.
A Teacher,1,"The slow drip of short weekly episodes does not do the series any favors, because the sum of the series is much stronger than the episodes standing alone."
A Teacher,1,A Teacher...deftly handles the delicate and incendiary material without indulging in sensationalism or titillation.
A Teacher,0,Lots of people have bad childhoods and boring spouses yet never end up becoming sexual predators. Where's the limited series about those people?
A Teacher,1,"This series understands how quickly bad decisions can develop into something toxic, and how even the most alluring predators can manipulate a sense of trust from their victims."
A Teacher,1,Mara plays this up with an extraordinary multilayered performance designed to throw us off balance and at various times she leaves the viewer unsure of what to think.
A Teacher,1,"A Teacher doesn't try to spare its audience when it comes to how its core relationship develops; its banal portrait of a predator and the affair she creates does a good job accomplishing it's goal, which is to make its audience squirm."
A Teacher,1,"Graphic sexually - this is FX on Hulu, after all - but also in its unsparing emotional honesty, A Teacher aims to bring unusual depth to this unpleasant subject and largely succeeds. Still, this is one life lesson that shouldn't have been taught."
A Teacher,1,"If you give it a chance, A Teacher will surprise you."
A Teacher,1,A Teacher's lessons are all the more devastating for appearing incomplete.
A Teacher,1,"At less than 30 minutes a pop, A Teacher is still a quick and satisfying binge."
A Teacher,1,"While its exploration of consequences is admirable and responsible given the topic of sexual predation, the second half is anti-climatic in a way that feels undramatic."
A Teacher,1,There is plenty of room to get lost in A Teacher; I just wish it saved more for redemption.
A Teacher,0,"Mara and Robinson really are excellent, and the series has unsettling atmosphere to spare. But outside of some specific moments in its second half, A Teacher feels as superficial and generic as its title."
A Teacher,1,"There's no preachiness, just a chronicle of what happened. I went from hating the show and preparing my devastating review to deeply admiring it."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
A Teacher,1,"It's purposefully disquieting and thoroughly disturbing, anchored by strong performances from Mara and Robinson that underscore how our gendered stereotypes are failing those who need protection most."
A Teacher,1,"Robinson, in particular, delivers a nuanced performance in a series that could best be improved by less build-up and even more exploration of the affair's victim."
A Teacher,1,"Mostly succeeds thanks to its willingness to carefully confront the ugly, unromantic truths about an issue - child sexual abuse - that impacts millions of people."
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
A Teacher,1,A stern look at a controversial subject. When will Kate Mara be recognied for the talent she is!
A Teacher,1,"A Teacher stands out because it's rare to come across such contained, sharp storytelling on TV in the Peak Content era."
A Teacher,0,"While it's visually handsome, with performances from the two leads that are equally staggering, the show fails to accomplish what it wants to do in the first place."
A Teacher,1,"In perhaps her richest role ever, Mara makes for a compelling lead, her usual coldness finding a fitting vessel in a character in need of warmth and uncomplicated adoration."
A Teacher,0,"At a time when TV embraces inventive and risky storytelling, ""A Teacher"" looks and feels like something that belonged on cable 10 years ago."
A Teacher,0,"A Teacher is just an uncomfortable, frustrating viewing experience, and not in the ways it's meant to be."
A Teacher,1,"Television is a medium that allows us to live with characters; instead, A Teacher gives us a highlight reel of psychic convalescence, before ending on a note of oversimplified closure."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"Joss Whedon and his collaborators enrich and deepen the slayer mythology in its final season with a level of feminist commentary, sexual politics, and mythological resonance and reclamation that resonates long after the final episode is over."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,I'm moved to tears by this epic exhibition of raw Girl Power... It was beautiful.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"But season 6 and season 7, however messy and polarising, actually throw into sharp relief why Buffy resonates 20 years later: they are works of art that come from a place of honesty."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,While a lot of superheroes are plucky outsiders when shown in high school...Joss Whedon takes Buffy in a different direction.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"A tightly written, emotional rollercoaster with memorable characters and one of the best superhero shows the '90s had to offer."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"The thing that's interesting about season seven, in premise, is that it asks Buffy to be a leader to a group of people who don't really want to be there."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"By the time of its seventh and final season, there was a feeling that many of the cast just wanted it all to be over - something unfortunately reflected in the performances."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,The reason why Buffy is so relatable is there is no way the viewer could miss its metaphors.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,Buffy Summers saved the world a lot. One of the worlds she saved was mine.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"I... didn't really like this season. More clunkers than good episodes, but ""Chosen"" still stands as one of the best series finales I've ever seen."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is still incredibly relevant and, let's be honest, it's a work of freaking art!"
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"Subversive, funny and emotionally engaging: there is still nothing like this cultural icon."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, at its heart, has always been about testing what defines a hero - beneath the trappings of costumes and powers and tragic back-stories."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"While it wasn't as good as what had come before, it still managed to pack one hell of a punch."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,Exactly the kind of big-budget finale the show needed to go out on a bang.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"The new season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is being touted as going back to basics after something of a convoluted, murky season, but so far, it strikes me more as a transitional one"
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"But on TV, the Buffyverse still stands alone. I don't know when - or if - we'll see its thrilling, clever, moving, funny, feminist like again."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,One of the most improbable pop-culture phenomena of recent times.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"The reunion is no accident, but it is very satisfying, in a full-circle, complete-the-story sort of way. So is this last hour itself, one of the most satisfying series finales in years."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,1,"I liked season seven by and large, [but] I feel like the having it follow the usual Buffy arc was a mistake, given that the ultimate aim of this season seemed to be to show how Buffy is a Chosen among Chosen, destined to change the rules of the game."
Looking for Alaska,1,Looking For Alaska takes huge advantage of the chance to flesh out its ensemble.
Looking for Alaska,1,"Looking For Alaska, with all its bumps in the road much like its hurricane epicenter Alaska, is an adaption with heart, an endeavor delivered to fans with the deepest understanding of the text and the love that made it a success to begin with."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Sometimes, the drama is undercut by the relaxed nature of the series and its buttery, calming cinematography but ""Looking for Alaska"" keeps its focus on its characters as the beating heart of the show."
Looking for Alaska,1,The last two episodes of Looking for Alaska masterfully depict the damage and grief that follow...
Looking for Alaska,1,Popular YA book yields excellent series for mature teens.
Looking for Alaska,1,"I can only speak from the perspective of someone who has multiple copies of this book on her shelves. But so far, I'm confident in saying you'll instantly fall in love with the series whether you've experienced the story before or not."
Looking for Alaska,1,"In 2019, Hulu's adaptation of the book somehow feels truer to the story Green set out to tell than the book itself."
Looking for Alaska,1,The result is a series that is probably infinitely better than the movie ever would have been but which also feels distinctly of an era - a throwback to a time nobody is ready to be nostalgic for just yet.
Looking for Alaska,1,Even with its flaws - including a narrative slowdown around Ep. 4 - this is a rare teen-lit adaptation that works on multiple levels. And that's something worth looking for.
Looking for Alaska,1,"The show hit home - and not just for its throwback music and early-2000s fashion. It's poised to do the same for today's teens, for reasons that go far beyond appearances."
Looking for Alaska,1,"A triumph of collaboration, a rare case in which a story is adapted for the screen by exactly the right set of hands who treat it with the level of respect it so requires."
Looking for Alaska,1,"All of the characters in this show are exceptional. None of them are good people; they are all deeply unlikable, but still likable at the same time, which makes them very real."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Through the first four episodes, Looking for Alaska has done a great job of creating perfectly flawed characters. There is not one character that is all good or all bad. Just like life."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Not only does the adaptation capture the nostalgic feeling of reading the novel for the first time (say at 15, awkward and lovelorn), it handles tragedy much more delicately and naturally than other teen series in recent years."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
Looking for Alaska,1,"The story should also be universal to anyone who has ever had a teenage experience and to anyone who has longed for something more, especially given your circumstances in life."
Looking for Alaska,1,"This episode perfectly captures the cruel self-absorption of teens, who find their parents' feelings sooooo embarrassing but can't see how absurd their own huge emotions can be."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Looking for Alaska has heart and soul, and has more in common with its forebears than its contemporaries. This is Dawson's Creek with regular alcohol; The OC in Alabama."
Looking for Alaska,0,"Though its cast is immensely likable and more than up to the task at hand, this limited series never manages to fill the characters or its narrative with enough emotional depth to accomplish what it's trying to."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
Looking for Alaska,1,"The perfect show if you're looking to lose yourself in a series that has a clear beginning, middle, and end."
Looking for Alaska,1,"It feels like it fits right along with the Schwartz/Savage oeuvre (The O.C., Gossip Girl), but because it's based on John Green's novel, it's a little different."
Looking for Alaska,1,It's a terrific cast with some choice music.
Looking for Alaska,1,"Looking for Alaska isn't trying to replace the book, nor would it ever. It breathes new life into the material, introducing it to a fresh audience while giving us old hats the chance to view our treasured story from a different perspective."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Hulu's Looking for Alaska is a coming of age story done right. Yes, it's filled with the melodrama you would expect from a teen drama, but it delivers a solid plot about a group of younger people trying to find themselves in the world."
Looking for Alaska,1,"In Schwartz and Savage's hands, Looking for Alaska actually manages to improve upon the original work-no small feat for an onscreen adaptation of a beloved book."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Based on the autobiographical novel by John Green, the series is freighted with foreboding and the intensity of adolescent emotion."
Looking for Alaska,1,Looking for Alaska is a cup of melancholy chamomile tea sipped while staring wistfully out of a window.
Looking for Alaska,1,"With eight episodes, there's rarely a character who doesn't get to reveal some more vulnerable layer. These cracks in the veneer sometimes take too long to show themselves, but they're always welcome."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Looking for Alaska is an emotionally compelling story about tragedy and grief, about hope, friendship, forgiveness, and the chaotic complexity that is the human condition."
Looking for Alaska,1,"The best of the three bright newcomers is Hulu's Looking For Alaska, which is long on charm and beautifully textured performances."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Dominated by Froseth and the solid young cast, it's a solid adaptation of a much loved book, even if its successful adapting can't always fix its problems."
Looking for Alaska,1,"It's a familiar coming-of-age story, but one executed at a high level, and with far more thought than usual given to all the kids who were forced to grow up long before the main character has to."
Looking for Alaska,1,"It's as if Looking for Alaska was cut loose from the anchor of Miles's narratorial voice and then swung in the direction of the strongest prevailing wind, drifting toward all the new, rich material the miniseries finds."
Looking for Alaska,1,"Hulu's Looking For Alaska limited series is sure to become a coming-of-age mainstay, a series teenagers and adults alike will turn to for comfort and catharsis as the seasons of their lives turn and loss inevitably comes, as it is wont to do."
Death Note,1,"If Death Note succeeds in at least one thing, it is that it has possibly created the most interesting and intriguing character of all anime."
Death Note,1,"Death Note is one of the most tightly plotted anime you're likely to watch... It's a fascinating show with a colorful cast of main characters, with moments both hilarious and haunting."
Death Note,1,"A well-paced thriller with remarkable characters, thought-provoking themes, lots of unexpected twists, and fascinating battles of wit."
Death Note,1,"The storyline is terrific -- as with horror-fantasies like Boogiepop Phantom and Paranoia Agent, Death Note doesn't limit the focus to the protagonist, and it considers the effects his activities would have on society at large."
Death Note,1,[Death Note] deserves a space on the list of the best anime of all time.
Death Note,1,Death Note's audacious attempt to explore and even question the idea of morality is ambitious and ultimately more hit than miss.
Death Note,1,My final take on Death Note is thus: This was the greatest anime there has ever been. This was the greatest anime dub there has ever been.
Death Note,1,Some droning voice acting leadens what is otherwise a brilliantly terse noir.
Death Note,1,This cat-and-mouse series is highly addictive.
Death Note,1,"Death Note holds a prominent position in the canon of modern anime, and at only 37 episodes is well worth the time it'll take you to watch it."
Death Note,1,Death Note is a fascinating concept that heads into unsuspected territory. It's unlikely that you'd find a sociopath...as the protagonist in a Western television show.
Death Note,1,"The slow, subtle character progression keeps you addicted to the chaos, as you watch the series' main character evolve alongside it."
Death Note,1,A somewhat brainy series that explores the mind of a young man whose almost childlike vision of a new world allows him to detach himself from the immorality of his acts.
Death Note,1,"Beyond its deft twists and turns, Death Note also addresses questions about morality, justice, and capital punishment. All this, plus beautiful animation and well-written dialogue and plot, makes Death Note the cream of the animated crop."
Power,1,This show is worth a look.
Power,1,"Power sets the stage for a final season that appears to be less about redemption, and more about revenge."
Cardinal,1,Talk about revenge being a dish best served cold.
Cardinal,1,"It's a good mystery, a mood piece beautifully performed and strikingly made, with great sensitivity to what the cold landscape harbours and reveals. It's quiet, hushed, letting the landscape articulate its wintry disposition."
Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.
Cardinal,1,"Cardinal provides that rare pleasure: a sense of something being better than it needs to be. It is slow without being frustrating or dull, thoughtful without being ponderous or pretentious."
Cardinal,1,"It is therefore wonderful, and hooks, if slowly, from the outset. This series looks set to echo, a little late admittedly, the birth of Scandi noir."
Cardinal,1,"Fortunately, Cardinal has reached the point when the personnel are more interesting than the perps, so we'll stick with it if only to find out if Lise and Cardinal ever do have that coffee. We'll stay for the snow-packed landscape too."
Cardinal,1,"Still, this sub-zero whodunnit is chilling, thrilling stuff. Tension slowly seeps into the viewer like frostbite."
The Adventures of Merlin,1,Colin Morgan and Bradley James have always had incredible chemistry and it's all cashed in here. Their scenes are heartbreaking and beautifully portrayed. There was more bromance in this one episode that in Sherlock and Supernatural put together.
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"It's always been classy fare, but if anything Merlin is even more confident now. Still expansively filmed and able to entice great names, there's now more beef to the battles and punch to the humour."
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"The Merlin finale had all of the ingredients of a great ending: an epic battle, a leader making the ultimate sacrifice for his people and the triumph of good over evil."
The Adventures of Merlin,1,[There are] all things that make for an unsettling 43 minutes.
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"It's all quite good fun, even if you're not exactly the target audience."
The Adventures of Merlin,1,The biggest joy of Merlin came from watching it improve year on year.
The Adventures of Merlin,1,The fifth series has... seen a new dynamic and a subsequent kick up the armoury.
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"The cast, led by the superb Colin Morgan, deliver fantastic final performances, the script is admirably dark and doesn't shy away from what is a difficult ending, and the show as a whole climaxes on an emotional high."
The Adventures of Merlin,1,"Merlin had big shoes to fill -- it was the series that ran when Doctor Who... wasn't on our screen. With series five, it filled those shoes admirably. Each episode has been an achievement in storytelling"
The Adventures of Merlin,1,The show's writers have ensured that Merlin: Arthur's Bane Part 1 has thrust us back into the heart of an intriguing world of myth and magic.
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
Dave,1,"If the first season of Dave was a revelation, a shocker of epic proportions both in the quality of the story and the lengths the show will venture to for a laugh, then the second season is a continued journey on that upward path."
Dave,1,"Painful and privileged, but clever."
Dave,1,"Overall, this season tries to walk a very thin line. The stunning part is it kind of works. In Season 2, Dave is at his worst. But Dave is at its best..."
Dave,1,"With more focus and subtlety than before, the new season of Dave proves this is a series worth your time. And let's be honest, those stupid jokes still make us belly laugh."
Dave,1,"Instead of devoting episodes to supporting characters, it devotes its season to critiquing Dave's singular identity - namely, how his viewpoint is rooted in whiteness and privilege."
Dave,1,Don't let the childish marketing fool you. Or do let the childish marketing fool you. Just give Dave a try.
Dave,1,"For a show full of sight gags involving state-of-the-art autoerotic technology, ""Dave"" is deeply thoughtful about this."
Dave,1,"Dave might be self-centered, but Dave at its best spreads its attention between all its characters. Fine, fine, I'll follow."
Dave,1,"This was already an excellent show that seems to have leveled up in its second season. As he works on the new album, Dave the character is struggling to expand what he can do; Dave the comedy has already figured that out."
Dave,1,"[Dave has] sharper humor that feels like it's taking risks with more confidence, even as Lil Dicky himself lacks exactly that."
The First,1,"Sadly mistaken for a full on sci fi epic, The First is a drama quest on our limits and emotions. Sean Penn shines. [Full review in Spanish]."
The First,0,The First needs to up its game or it's headed for the black hole of oblivion.
The First,0,"The seriousness of the subject doesn't entirely explain the solemnity of this pilot episode, nor the glacial pacing."
The First,1,"Even with a thruster rocket full of inspirational motivations and overly meticulous visuals, The First really doesn't have anything new to say, up close or in the big picture."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
The First,1,"Promises thoughtful drama that, like its characters, has lofty ambitions."
The First,1,"At worst, this could be just hours and hours of Penn being humourlessly tragic about things, as is so often his way. At best, though, it could be phenomenal."
The First,1,"Penn, for all my snark, is a grand leading man. Natascha McElhone, too, does a bang-up job as aerospace magnate Laz Ingram, and, all in all, this is shaping up rather well as a three-way battle between corporate ambition, technology and lives."
The First,1,"The First is not sci-fi: the bugs here are in the emotional systems, the errors entirely human. As a result, it has the right dramatic stuff."
The First,1,"With his usual skill of hinting at great wells of rage and empathy, Penn lifts Hegarty above these clichés."
The First,1,"""Godspeed"" was a phrase used. At this point it could do with a bit of speed itself."
The First,0,"The series may well develop into an absorbing character-led take on humankind's dream of exploring the solar system, but Willimon seemed to be relying on the audience having a bite at the second episode before deciding."
The First,1,"The First is surprisingly pompous, inflated by its soundtrack... But stick with it."
The First,1,"The First delivers, handsomely."
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
The First,1,"By the end of The First, you will care as much about the life or death stakes of this mission as the families and friends watching the historic launch. That alone makes this worth your time."
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
The First,1,"I went into The First expecting, almost hoping, to hate it, and I came out liking it, because it captures the magic of the NASA drama."
The First,1,"The First does deliver one hell of a stunning finale episode, if you can slog your way through the first seven episodes, which are just barely compelling enough to keep viewers interested in seeing what's next."
The First,1,"The First is a staggering achievement, a blindingly ambitious show that is as vast in its scope as it is intimate in its storytelling."
The First,1,"Space-exploration drama has language, strong emotion."
The First,1,"Penn's casting is the big draw here, and the Oscar-winning actor is an unlikely but potent choice to play an aging American hero."
The First,1,"From the moment Penn enters the picture, we're reminded of just what a compelling screen presence he is and how he can make even the smallest moments interesting and original."
The First,1,"The Sean Penn space show is great, and space lovers and TV generalists alike ought to consider giving it a look."
The First,1,"Penn is solid and stolid as Hagerty, conveying more depth in the scenes with his family than he does with his crew."
The First,1,"The First could be made of stronger stuff than it is. Its use of imagery and a drawling, unidentified voice-over philosophizer are both recurrent and generally intrusive."
The First,1,I teared up. It got me. I don't know how else to explain myself.
The First,1,"A noble, ambitious series, but one that demands equally ambitious viewers."
The First,0,"A jaunt to the stars may be forever memorable, but there's something about The First that makes it disappointingly easy to forget."
The First,1,"You don't have to be enthralled with the technical complexity and logistics involved in sending a crewed mission to Mars to be captivated by The First, but it helps."
The First,1,It orbits high above the cable traffic.
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The First,1,"Full of high-minded ambition and the kind of uplifting narrative one used to find on ""The West Wing,"" ""The First""... looks like a series to savor."
The First,1,"The First is artful, very well-acted, and takes on some fairly significant questions."
The First,1,"Penn, for one, is a revelation here...You don't often see or hear his pain and grief, but you constantly feel it."
The First,0,"The First begins as a space exploration drama on its way to Mars, but the show, like the mission it depicts, never quite lifts off the ground."
The First,0,The First is never quite able to blast off.
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
The First,1,"Penn is even better than expected, but Natascha McElhone's steely Laz Ingram is the character to watch."
The First,0,"The show has a bland, sanitized feel, no matter how hard its cheesy score tries to heighten the inspiration at every turn. The best sci-fi stories, underneath the robots and space flights, are great human stories."
The First,1,"It's not what I thought it was going to be... But it moved and impressed me to the point where I didn't particularly care if a given scene or story line was ""working"" or not It has a pioneering spirit."
The First,1,"As flawed as I found the first season, I'll admit, it hooked me enough that I'm interested to see how they live life on Mars."
The First,0,"Providing all the attendant pageantry and triumphant music and inspirational speeches you might expect, before shifting back to the glummest, slowest, least enthusiastic approach possible to the material."
The First,1,"Some viewers may find ""The First"" too slow, especially in the first two episodes, but ""The First"" becomes more engrossing as it unfurls, especially when the show's scope broadens out from Tom and explores the other characters."
The First,1,"The First is a perfectly adequate way to pass the time. Even though you may not be on the edge of your seat from start to finish, you can likely enjoy the ride for what it is."
The First,0,"[Tom] acts like a complex hero in this post-""Sopranos"" era, but the aimless writing and the arty editing leave him flat."
The First,0,By the time the astronauts do get into space it doesn't feel like a triumph for mankind at all. It feels like what should have happened six episodes ago.
The First,1,"[Penns] physical transformation and high-intensity confrontations with the impressively game Jacoby-Heron are showy, but the slowly unfolding role also lets him play quiet moments, and even light ones."
The First,1,"Sean Penn, in his first TV series regular role, delivers a tremendously affecting performance as Providence commander Tom Hagerty."
The First,1,Say what you will about Sean Penn - but the guy has charisma.
The First,0,"Visually compelling with a nicely pensive music score - courtesy of Colin Stetson of Arcade Fire and Bon Iver - ""The First"" is otherwise plodding and padded."
The First,0,"You'd think a show about space exploration would be at least somewhat thrilling and wondrous, but The First makes going into space seem like a grim, depressing prospect."
The First,0,What we're left with is a show that often drags and leads to a kind of clichéd melodrama that has a lot of ideas but isn't always successful at executing them.
The First,1,Penn pours his mightiest melancholy and perfected artistry into the part.
The First,1,The commitment to depicting the logistics of getting such an enormous project off the ground might be a chore if The First weren't stunningly shot and entrenched in huge depths of feeling.
The First,1,"Some may say it's out of touch, but really, ""The First"" feels like a pioneer amid a sea of narrative cynicism - a look past the present to where we need to be, and how we can get there."
The First,1,"The political opposition, the intrapersonal strife, the glimmers of idealism participants know better than to feel, but do anyway. It's enough to make one excited for a second season."
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
The First,0,"In the end The First feels much like Mars itself: cold, bumpy, and too far away to touch."
The First,1,"The First isn't about the destination - it's about the journey. It is a thoughtful, often melancholy show - a show about sacrifice, and grief, and raw, ugly emotions. Here is a saga about living, and dying, and everything in between."
The First,1,"The First comes out of the gate swinging and presents immediately as a masterclass in how to do prestige television right. It's a very serious and down-to-earth show (pun intended), but it's not pretentious and self-righteous."
The First,0,"It's a series that's all countdown, but no launch."
This Way Up,1,"I really need them to bring it back, so I can see more comic acting with serious undertones by the wonderful Irish actresses Aisling Bea and Sharon Horgan, not to mention Tobias Menzies and Aasif Mandvi."
This Way Up,1,"It continues to get at the deep, sometimes damaged, bonds that are wound through sisterhood, while capturing the fabric of everyday emotional struggle through a tone that can switch from the irreverent to the heartbreaking."
This Way Up,1,"This Way Up is a cozy show about characters who we want to spend as much time as we can with, which makes the brevity of the series both a blessing and a curse."
This Way Up,1,"This Way Up doesn't move like any other half-hour series. It's a lot funnier for a start, and it occasionally does more in a single scene... than most shows can muster in an entire season."
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
This Way Up,1,"Watch an episode and you'll soon find yourself watching two and three at a time, blitzing through the first season and swimming a marathon through the even better second season."
This Way Up,1,"So finely tuned is Bea's characterisation that you root for Aine and laugh with her, even as you keep a wary eye on her skidding and sliding into yet another Very Bad Time."
This Way Up,0,"While the show balances its many themes and characters well, in the end, it feels a bit rushed."
This Way Up,1,[Bea] and Horgan perfectly capture the sisterly dynamic. Watching it feels like falling back into the company of your most sarcastic girlfriends.
This Way Up,1,"The opening sauna scene went on too long, but it didn't matter because Aisling Bea and Sharon Horgan are oozing with so much talent that you could watch them doing nothing."
This Way Up,1,"It touches on many modern-day elements and while it pokes fun at them, it doesn't do so in a pointed way where the viewer would think, ""Of course you have to make fun of that."""
This Way Up,1,What's really wonderful with This Way Up is the way the show continues to portray the reality of living with mental health challenges without pathologising the character or presenting them as a great anomaly.
This Way Up,1,This is a show that understands these characters far more than they know themselves.
This Way Up,1,It's all so funny and humane and clever and such a perfect showcase for Bea's gift for writing and playing allusive half-sentences around moments of potential devastation and hilarity.
This Way Up,1,"The supporting cast are a delight (especially Kadiff Kirwan as Aine's flatmate Bradley, and Varma as Charlotte), but it is the warmth and authenticity of Bea and Horgan's double act that makes this show such a winner."
This Way Up,1,"Series two somehow manages to be funnier, kinder and more heartbreaking than its predecessor, and is a perfect testament to [Aisling] Bea's talent."
This Way Up,1,"""This is a show that does mental health so well because it explores it in all of its complexity ... I binged it all in one sitting. I bet you will too."""
This Way Up,1,This Way Up is the latest in a line of cerebral and whip-smart British dark comedies that reflect the imperfect salve of humor on the imperfect wound of grief.
This Way Up,1,"Watching This Way Up is like eavesdropping on a happy, zany family."
This Way Up,1,"The series' sensibility is so unlike American sitcoms, worlds apart and far edgier with leads you only grudgingly like. A wild experience."
This Way Up,1,"It's short, sweet, but worth every bit of your time."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Thanks to her craft and well-known expressiveness, Lane manages to be the focal point of every scene. [Full review in Spanish]"
Y: The Last Man,1,This is TV machine-tooled for the times we live in.
Y: The Last Man,1,"""Y"" does a solid job balancing apocalypse porn with the central conceit of the show."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Having so many leads dilutes the emotional impact, with the chaos of the unknown acting as a low-level threat that's annoying more than devastating."
Y: The Last Man,1,"It is, simply as an apocalypse drama, good enough."
Y: The Last Man,1,Well-drawn characters and propulsive storytelling hint that brighter days will come - if this lot can just survive the immediate post-apocalypse.
Y: The Last Man,1,"Is the lead a bad actor or is part of the show a wink-and-nod to the fact that the only remaining dude is an obnoxious doink? Some of the supporting cast crackles and snaps, but things never fully pop into place. And never will! Dang."
Y: The Last Man,1,"FX's adaptation of Brian K Vaughan and Pia Guerra's infamous comic series is slow and deliberate, which is good for world building and occasionally sluggish for pacing. Great performances from Lane and Romans, with welcome Trans representation."
Y: The Last Man,1,"This show's unique take on the well-trodden post-apocalyptic tale is immediately appealing, but its large cast and overly ambitious story-telling also undermine its potential."
Y: The Last Man,1,If Y: The Last Man goes full Battlestar Galactica - particularly the bits with President Roslin determining what it means to survive vs truly live - then I'm fully on board.
Y: The Last Man,1,"Based on a long-running comic-book series by Brian Vaughan (a veteran of Lost who developed Under the Dome for TV) and Pia Guerra, it arrives with a world thoughtfully built and numerous issues well pondered."
Y: The Last Man,1,"After watching the seven episodes made available, it's clear the artists behind the series are interested in prodding this story in directions even bolder than I expected, balancing swift entertainment with heady political and bodily consideration."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Despite the considered pacing and heavy political lean, there's enough twists & turns & compelling characters to keep Y: The Last Man an engaging post-apocalyptic watch"
Y: The Last Man,0,"Yes, perhaps it was a rueful joke in the original comic books that the future of the male species depends upon the utterly uninteresting, immature Yorick, but here that twist is taken very seriously. The weight placed upon the character is just ludicrous."
Y: The Last Man,0,"It's impossible to say what Y: The Last Man lost or gained from that upheaval, but what's clear is that this vanilla offering of a post-apocalyptic nightmare is no doubt arriving a decade too late."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man is dystopian television for a post-Trump world. If you're looking for a series that uses the genre to hold a mirror to society as we know it, in all its imperfect glory, then you'll enjoy this character-driven narrative."
Y: The Last Man,1,This show's genius is in the details. The little glances. Microexpressions. Unspoken exchanges. Nora batting a vase off a table like a cat.
Y: The Last Man,1,"Despite how gender and identity have evolved over nearly two decades, Y: The Last Man also reminds us of the imbalances in various corners of society that are just as prevalent."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man delivers a dynamite premiere, immediately engaging its grotesque judgment day, before slamming the breaks and dragging us through the dreadfully slow minutes leading up to the event."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Vaughan and Guerra have writing credits on the new series, but the irreverence of the original seems to have been scrubbed in favor of a more somber approach."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man Offers a vision of a world turned upside down, but one in which, often troublingly, many of the pieces have landed in the same spots as before."
Y: The Last Man,1,"""Y"" is a deeply ambitious, engrossing epic that doesn't quite achieve the mastery and impact of its source material but is certainly a worthy adaptation."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man is finally here, and for all that's familiar to fans of the source in this TV version, it's a far different beast than the comic on which it's based. That is, by far, the best thing about it."
Y: The Last Man,1,"It's the show you didn't know you needed - a post-apocalyptic drama populated almost exclusively with strong, competent, complex women."
Y: The Last Man,0,"A world with almost no men has so much potential, but this one is squandered on its mostly lifeless characters."
Y: The Last Man,1,One of the most interesting things about the first few episodes is how they zoom in on the show's core cast at some of the rawest and perhaps most honest points in their lives.
Y: The Last Man,1,"""Y: The Last Man"" works in pieces and with the establishment of its first season it's easy to see where things could be stronger as it goes on."
Y: The Last Man,1,"It stumbles a bit early on, but FX's adaptation of Y: The Last Man manages to balance its many complicated thematic elements while taking some fresh approaches to the postapocalyptic adventure saga."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man suffers from a slow-moving first episode, but the story it sets up is intriguing and full of story possibilities."
Y: The Last Man,1,"This dystopian drama isn't about the spectacle of chaos but how that chaos brings out the best and worst of those enduring it. You can say the same of any show about the end of the world, but here the reliance on character feels much more essential."
Y: The Last Man,1,"It takes a while to get the exposition out of the way, but this adaptation of Y: The Last Man has plenty of potential."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While no one would expect the dystopian concept to yield feel-good TV, watching society break down this way, at this moment, has a glutton-for-punishment quality without outlandish wrinkles like zombie gore to introduce a sense of escapism."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Once the show moves past its been-there, watched-that dystopian, scene-setting premiere episode with too many similarities to FX's The Strain, Y: The Last Man becomes a compulsively watchable series."
Y: The Last Man,1,Maybe in the future they'll begin to seriously explore how women freed of patriarchy might run a world that's different from every other TV dystopia or news report.
Y: The Last Man,1,What makes the FX production stand out is writing that rises it above the genre origins.
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The mysterious intrigue circling its end of the world causality is overshadowed by a populace wrestling with grief, fear, and anger. That's probably a smart decision in 2021."
Y: The Last Man,1,I walked into these six episodes hoping that the creators found away to adapt this as richly as Watchmen but entertained enough that they found something close enough to the first couple seasons of The Walking Dead to keep me watching.
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man is a perfectly serviceable political thriller, but the comic-book trappings that really made the panels sing just aren't present here."
Y: The Last Man,1,"It's a series with a whole that is far more fascinating than its slow-paced parts. If you give it the space of a few episodes, this new drama promises great things."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Unfortunately, this series doesn't do enough to modernize questions from the original text."
Y: The Last Man,1,This is a very well-acted series and one that really deserves an audience for the story alone. It just doesn't feel quite as revolutionary as it should be.
Y: The Last Man,1,"The absolute revelation of Y: The Last Man is Ashley Romans. As Agent 355, she can pilot a helicopter, perform CPR, kick ass at hand-to-hand combat, run in style and talk her way into any room. She simply exudes confidence. She looks good in anything too."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Episodes are paced at a glacial level, and strong performances nonetheless lose themselves in the grim soup of the show's overall tone. There's a creeping feeling that we've seen so much of this before."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The premiere is an inspired weaving together of creeping dread and disaster movie spectacle, laced with a quirky sense of humor."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The show feels fresh more often than not, with a number of compelling, haunting, scary, or even sometimes genuinely funny sequences to be found in each episode."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man still gets off to a promising start, coupling thoughtful worldbuilding with a strong, character-driven story."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
Y: The Last Man,1,"Y: The Last Man improves so much over the course of its first six episodes that its potential feels limitless. If audiences can weather its apocalypse, the show might well become something special by the time rebuilding commences."
Y: The Last Man,1,"The story's overall focus on the governing instead of the governed makes for a sludgy watch at times. Still, there are enough seeds planted in these first three episodes to bloom into something exciting and interesting going forward."
Y: The Last Man,0,Eliza Clark took over after the initial showrunners departed. She gamely tries to expand the story's ensemble... but there's a basic lack of flair in the storytelling.
Y: The Last Man,1,"The series' directors keep the focus on what is sad and scary, without always grasping that some of the series' genre tropes should maybe just be pleasurable and exciting. You can want to escape a fictional world and still have it play as escapist."
Y: The Last Man,0,Y: The Last Man is perfectly serviceable sci-fi fare that won't move the needle too much in either direction in terms of generating controversy or inspiring awe. And that's a shame... That it settles for dull and uninspired breaks my heart.
Y: The Last Man,1,"For now, what's most compelling is Y's specific lens on one of the most familiar post-apocalyptic tropes: how disaster not only brings out the best in us, but also the worst. Or, put another way: Maybe men had it coming, and maybe we all did."
Y: The Last Man,1,A solid but frustrating show that frequently struggles to embrace what's unique about itself.
Y: The Last Man,0,"The real undoing of Y: The Last Man... is that it takes itself too seriously to allow for many other emotions beyond ""desperate"" and ""grieving."""
Y: The Last Man,1,"The Y: The Last Man series is a terse, slow simmering, at times head-scratching, but engaging take on a particular kind of apocalypse."
Archer,1,"It may be a little patchy at times, but Season 12 of Archer sees the spy saga justify its long run, and proves that the show is at its best when it plays to its true strength  its characters."
Archer,0,"Maybe that emphasis on putting a new shine on old fruit is fitting, since this does, indeed, feel just like an episode of Archer-only older."
Archer,1,"Season 12 maintains this restored momentum throughout the episodes made available to critics, and Walter is central to that. She's also irreplaceable, and that factor lends these episodes a slight sting."
Archer,1,"The first two episodes of Archer season 12 demonstrate why the series has had such longevity, with its dysfunctional ensemble delivering hilarious dialogue amid international conflict and internal backbiting."
The Last Man on Earth,1,Another US comedy I've been lapping up...
The Last Man on Earth,1,"Ultimately, it all comes to an abrupt, unsatisfying end."
The Last Man on Earth,1,This is a series that takes the imagery of shows like The Walking Dead and plays it all down for fun and farce.
The Last Man on Earth,1,The Last Man on Earth was dessert in a time of The Handmaid's Tale and The Walking Dead. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Last Man on Earth,1,"Just don't let the story of The Last Man on Earth end where it has...don't rob us of TV's strangest, most unique comedy, just when it's on the verge of taking a major step forward."
The Last Man on Earth,1,"Now that I know it has been, and after rewatching the episode, it feels like a robot dog hitting a high C, making a piano explode - in other words, the right note to end on."
The Last Man on Earth,1,Jason Sudeikis was as perfect as I expected he would be.
The Last Man on Earth,0,The Last Man on Earth remains very much on the bubble.
The Last Man on Earth,1,"Four seasons in, it's starting to become clear that when weirdos bond, they bond hard. And in a most wonderfully entertaining way."
The Last Man on Earth,1,The show still puts us in a position where we can't help but root for [Pam].
The Last Man on Earth,1,"For so many shows the introduction of babies is a death sentence. In this case, however, it adds something that always makes The Last Man on Earth its best: high stakes."
The Last Man on Earth,1,"The gang, now with two more members, can finally set sail for a brighter tomorrow."
The Last Man on Earth,1,"Like watching two sea-doos slowly arcing through the ocean on an unlikely, yet inevitable collision course, The Last Man on Earth Season 4 premiere offered a few tantalizing possibilities, but ultimately felt stuck on a predictable path."
White Collar,1,White Collar continues to prove there's not a pinch dapper con artist Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) can't wiggle out of as the cop-buddy drama enters its sixth and final season.
White Collar,1,"If Collar must go, at least it's starting its exit with an outing that reminds us of why we liked the show in the first place, from the clever (but not excessively complicated) capers to the chemistry between stars Tim DeKay and Matt Bomer."
White Collar,1,"White Collar is among the most enjoyable shows ever to employ the USA formula of breezy, humor-laced intrigue."
White Collar,1,"All in all, there's clear indication that this season will be jam-packed with all the action and intrigue six episodes could possibly contain. So let's enjoy them, shall we?"
White Collar,1,"White Collar works mostly because we like the characters so much, and no matter where Neal and Mozz end up, nothing seems likely to make us rethink that affection."
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
A Wilderness of Error,1,Smerling's haunting film-noir visual style succeeds at reinvigorating an old story. His messy conclusion isn't necessarily a problem.
A Wilderness of Error,1,"""A Wilderness of Error"" is a new kind of true documentary that will keep you on the edge of your seat and eager for more information."
A Wilderness of Error,1,Tantalizingly inconclusive.
A Wilderness of Error,1,Even in an era of documentary series riches... this one is quite compelling as well as artful.
A Wilderness of Error,1,"""A Wilderness of Error"" is half sordid true crime, half Platonic metaphysics and in its dreamy visual way re-creates the hazy history of an appalling event with no reliable witnesses."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"A Wilderness of Error is about that need and about the discomfort that emerges when we can't warp the facts to our need for closure. It's an unsatisfying entry in a genre in which viewers usually demand satisfaction, and it's all the more gripping."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"While inconclusive in many ways, A Wilderness Of Error is strangely satisfying."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"If you come to ""A Wilderness of Error"" looking for a definitive answer, or for some startling final-episode reveal that puts everything in a new light, you'll be disappointed."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a bit more entertaining than browsing the relevant Wiki articles, but it's a hell of a lot longer and ultimately less satisfying because, unlike that gathering of information, it sacrifices clarity for drama."
A Wilderness of Error,1,"Director Marc Smerling, working closely with Morris as an interview subject in the FX series, captures the swirl of narratives in this particular case with tight editing and expert construction."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"23 years after its initial release, ""Cowboy Bepop"" remains a masterpiece of the category, a triumph of coolness and a testament to the narrative depth anime can occasionally show."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Choose subtitles over English dubbing; the native vocal performances, in Japanese, convey a hypnotizing malaise."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Its tightly-wound narratives, gorgeously three-dimensional characters, vast original universe, and distinctly mesmerizing visual style help it stand apart from the crowd."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"For all its superbly detailed backgrounds, funky jazz/hip-hop soundtrack and Philip K Dick-esque story, it's let down by stiffly drawn characters and some annoying supporting players."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"The characters in Cowboy Bebop are engaging, mysterious, and likable misfits one can easily sympathize with... Having one of the best English dubs out there, Cowboy Bebop is an excellent first anime."
Cowboy Bebop,1,The jazz used for the intergalactic-western setting is smart. It gives it an old-timey noir feeling and it meshes well with the way the characters are written and the way they're animated.
Cowboy Bebop,1,The show's greatest asset is its ability to look cool and be smart in ways that other anime only strive for.
Cowboy Bebop,1,"It feels like a magnum opus produced at the pinnacle of a long career despite being, almost unbelievably, Watanabe's first series as a director. It is a masterwork that should justly rank among the best works of television of all time."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Each of the 26 episodes of Cowboy Bebop exemplify a concerted effort to create artwork, music, plot, and character that best play off one another, establishing subtle but consistent series-long themes and arcs."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"It tends to resemble a random grab-bag of American and Japanese TV icons, tossed into a blender that's set on puree. But it's fast, frantic, and very funny, the animation is top-notch, and ""Lupin"" fans at least will find the characters warmly familiar."
Cowboy Bebop,1,Cowboy Bebop is the greatest anime series ever.
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Cowboy Bebop is now 20 years old and it is wild to think that this show, which has influenced countless artists, filmmakers, writers, and animators, feels utterly ageless."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Much as music so often does, Cowboy Bebop functions as a Rorschach test. Its episodes are songs, little odes to loss, love, anger, and ecstasy. They're portraits of some of the most human characters that have ever graced television."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Bebop lays down a stone-cold violent, futuristic groove."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Cowboy Bebop was a perfect storm of a series. It had an intriguing storyline, memorable characters and one of the most revolutionary soundtracks in anime."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Visually, the show was an astonishing feat of invention premised on unlimited cultural exchange."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"One of the all-time great anime series, this romp set in the year 2071 features plenty of action, but never skimped on character development."
Cowboy Bebop,1,Cowboy Bebop's atmospheric animation is a notch above the static images of many anime.
Cowboy Bebop,1,"Cowboy Bebop is perfect, hitting every off-centre beat and crazy subplot with reckless energy and momentum that nails it every episode."
Cowboy Bebop,1,The gloomy poetry of men walking into certain death is combined with Eastern philosophy over a backdrop of country music and Bebop jazz.
Cowboy Bebop,1,The show ultimately features so many cross-ranging influences and nods to other famous works it's almost impossible to keep track. It's Sergio Leone in a spacesuit. It's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with automatic weapons.
Cowboy Bebop,1,"The stories, dialogue, action, setting, and music all had to be in absolute harmony and they were. It's an amazing feat of creativity."
Cowboy Bebop,1,Combined retro-futuristic cool with a surprising emotional depth.
Harlots,1,"Harlots never pretends that its characters' lives are easy -- they're still at the mercy of a legal system that wasn't designed for them. It just shows that people like them existed, which is all they need to do to be worthy of portrayal."
Harlots,1,"Love a duck, Harlots was a rum do. Set among prostitutes in Georgian London, it was not sure if it was Arthur or Martha, a comedy or a drama, but it certainly grabbed the attention with both hands."
Harlots,1,"[T]here's still been something truly gutsy and fearless at the heart of season 3, and that's the reason this show is so incredibly compelling and watchable."
Harlots,1,"The show teems with actors having the time of their lives roaring out one another's full names, city streets with a triple-cross around every corner, a gleefully anachronistic score, and poisonously vibrant costumes."
Harlots,1,"Not unlike this review, the tone of Harlots continues to be ... disconcerting."
Harlots,1,"A thrilling, brainy bodice-ripper that combines the epic wordplay of Shakespeare, the ruthless political survivalism of Machiavelli and the gutting sentimentality of Mario Puzo."
Harlots,1,"In its third season, ""Harlots"" maintains everything that has made it occasionally difficult to watch...but those aspects are what makes this series worthwhile since they also pay off with insight, spirit, and cheeky humor."
Harlots,1,"Harlots' second season was better than the first, and this one could make you flip your powered wig."
Harlots,1,"If you haven't heard by now, Harlots, a Hulu Original period piece, is the most feminist television programming out there...As the series has done in other seasons, it's all about survival..."
Harlots,1,"Harlots proves it can still do what it does best, which is explore its themes with humor as it gives its female characters some very real obstacles without reducing them to outright victims."
Harlots,1,"Now in its spectacular third season, Harlots is back and it's still Hulu's most underrated gem."
Harlots,1,Harlots skips with a rebellious sense of joy this season.
Harlots,1,"In a world of arson, hangings, incest, bare-knuckle boxing, molly houses and murderous cults, the fact that Harlots still manages to keep its viewers on their toes is a true testament to its greatness."
Harlots,1,"While initially suffering some narrative foundering, season three retains the show's campy flourishes."
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
Ramy,1,"Squirm-inducing scenes aside, this is a fantastic show that it is easy to gallop through, as it takes a fresh and frank look at a group that historically hasn't been shown much on TV."
Ramy,1,"It's all a very different kind of punchline that allows the storytelling to feel much more authentic-even when the plot feels completely unrealistic, it's still grounded in reality."
Ramy,1,"I didn't expect season two to have the low-grade anxiety of Uncut Gems (for me), where you're always on your toes because you know that Ramy is going to mess up... I think that it's impressive that I love a show about an awful, horny man."
Ramy,1,Not since Master of None has the displaced immigrant experience been told with such authenticity and such tongue-in-cheek humor.
Ramy,1,"The standout episode focuses solely on Uncle Naseem (Laith Nakli)... The way Youssef and his writing team force you to look at him in a new light reminds you why this is among TV's most challenging, and finest, shows."
Ramy,1,"Ramy improves on its first season by refusing to rest on its laurels, continuing to pose deep spiritual questions while making you laugh."
Ramy,1,"In Ramy's continuous and confused struggle to be a better person, we can also see our own urban struggles navigating relationships and ideologies. There is a universality to Ramy's experience that is independent of his ethnicity and faith."
Ramy,1,"Ultimately, what makes Ramy powerful is how it manages to stay non-judgmental of its protagonist, and also steer away from him when it becomes overwhelming. The show provides no answers to any question he asks, and it's best that way."
Ramy,1,"Ramy eventually veers towards episodes that highlight side characters which allows the series to have multiple perspectives on the Muslim-American immigrant experience. It's in these tangents, that the show shines."
Ramy,1,"If in its first season, Ramy ... was a breath of fresh air (merely by focusing on an American-born Muslim), then the second season is a display of the series' empathetic depth."
Ramy,1,It is a rare show where the central drama revolves around forgiveness and seeking God. Ramy uses humor not to mock these concerns but to make them accessible and compelling.
Ramy,1,Unique and rather wonderful.
Ramy,1,RAMY brings a new perspective to the screen as it explores the challenges of what it's like being caught between a Muslim community that thinks life is a moral test and a millennial generation that thinks life has no consequences.
Ramy,1,"When the laughs do come, they're highly rewarding. The most engaging aspect of Ramy, though is that simple, dogged question: how to be yourself, how to be modern, and still be a person of faith."
Ramy,1,"Through Ramy's increased devotion, viewers get a broader understanding of Islam's tenets of peace and self-awareness, in addition to Youssef's brand of humor, which still illuminates the difficulties of being Muslim in American culture."
Ramy,1,"Season 2 of Ramy Youssef's Hulu dramedy is just as life-affirming, poignant, and funny as the first-only now it features one of the best actors on the planet..."
Ramy,1,"Ramy presents us with an exceedingly flawed protagonist. The show doesn't want to make him an example, and we not only see the beautiful aspects of his experiences but also the ridiculous ones."
Ramy,1,"Throughout the 30-minute format provides enough time to get the story told without lollygagging...""Ramy"" will jump from one scene to the next almost before you can get the laugh out. Yet it rarely seems hurried."
Ramy,1,"With a formidable mix of surrealism and humor, Youssef explores the complexities of being a religious millennial man."
Ramy,1,"Well-drawn supporting characters with sharp tongues help lighten the mood, and Hiam Abbass is hilarious as Ramy's daggy mother."
Ramy,1,"Perhaps the most potent insight in this second season is the lead's amenable but pathological defiance of personal responsibility, his well-meaning and winsome brew of good intentions and self-obsession."
Ramy,1,"Both depsite and because of uncomfortable moments like that, it's a joy to watch Ramy find his place in the world."
Ramy,1,"It's a smarter, better show for being so hard on Ramy, in part because it knows him well enough to not let the whole story rest on one young millennial's shoulders."
Ramy,1,"Ramy is still very funny and is as smart and easy to love as it ever was, and everything that made the first season award-worthy is present and stronger in its second go-round."
Ramy,1,"If there's a new release this week, or maybe even just this year, that has its finger on the pulse of the fear that again boiled over into anger, it's Ramy."
Ramy,1,"The result is a tremendous show that is heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and wickedly funny."
Ramy,1,Ups the stakes spiritually and otherwise this new season... With redemption and regret framing this truly American tale.
Ramy,1,"In a time when Americans repeatedly compartmentalize their empathy, it is a reminder that for many, these aren't topics to spotlight at will, but face every day."
Ramy,1,"It's difficult to make a show about a protagonist who's as lazily acquiescent as Ramy, especially when supporting characters are seldom given the vivivdness to shine on their own. And yet it's impossible not to be moved by season two's guiding observation"
Ramy,1,"Season 2 is moving and profane. Stupid funny, then scary serious. Topical and evergreen. Hyperspecific with wide appeal."
Ramy,1,"For everyone else, though, Ramy is most interesting and most arresting in the way it tells separate stories, finding flaws and humor and humanity for its minor characters in ways it often struggles to do for its main character."
Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing."
Ramy,1,"The show is a wonderful celebration of faith and trying to be a better person. Even with some miscalculations along the way, the second season is on par with the first and continues to be a powerful comedy that deserves your attention."
Ramy,1,"Ramy is still one of the freshest, thought-provoking comedies of the streaming era."
Ramy,1,"""Ramy"" holds a strong footing as a deep dive into a rarely represented community, while parsing through the complexities of what it means to be a good Muslim man."
Ramy,1,"One of the many strengths... is how its star and creator widens the focus beyond its eponymous character's own journey to reveal the challenges of assimilation for the rest of his family, each of whom takes center stage in impactful episodes of their own."
Ramy,1,"The best television finds a way to make the specific universal and the universal specific. There is no other show quite like Ramy, because there is no other character quite like Ramy."
Ramy,1,"...a charming, melancholy meditation on the verboten."
Ramy,1,"Season two is moving, heartbreaking, and relevant. Just the right combination of what a perfect season looks like."
Ramy,1,"Despite a couple of misses in the middle, season two is a remarkable experience that retains Ramy's charming storytelling and comedic nuances."
The Umbrella Academy,1,Perhaps the most emotional and well-crafted installment of the series.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"In the end, The Umbrella Academy Season 3 is a mix of cute moments, a predictable plot, and some laughs. It’s an enjoyable watch, but easy to see the building blocks of the story and ultimately, feels like it falls flat."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"It’s still an overstuffed show, but in building up the relationships audiences truly care about, season 3’s existential musings become time well spent."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"If you’re a fan of this show, already expect for your heart to break and rebuild itself at least a few times over the course of this season, but you’ll enjoy having those strings pulled."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The Umbrella Academy's third season is a dark, character-centric addition to the series that works thanks to a committed cast and solid writing."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The Umbrella Academy continues to do what it does best – combining superhero antics with gore galore, universe-crushing stakes, quick-witted quips and character dynamics that the fanbase will happily lap up."
The Umbrella Academy,1,The Umbrella Academy continues to be as intoxicating to viewers as the Hargreeves family is to themselves.
The Umbrella Academy,1,So much swimming to die on the shore. [Full review in Spanish]
The Umbrella Academy,1,Umbrella Academy showrunner Steve Blackman and his team -- including trans writer Thomas Page McBee -- weave Viktor's experience into a plotline that's already running at full speed without a hitch.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Three seasons in, the series is trying to do too much, and some of the show’s best moments are the ones it never saw coming. The overall effect is of a season that sticks the landing because of good luck."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 of the series might be the weirdest so far, but it’s also one of its best — which is saying a lot."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Gloriously weird, refreshingly progressive, and happily pulling out every stop on the way to the alternate timeline plot generator, The Umbrella Academy is its own damn animal, and indifferent to any gripes from those unwilling to climb aboard."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Once the latest blueprint is established, the assorted subplots yield diminishing returns, indulging in strange detours while building toward the inevitable faceoff with the amorphous threat."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"More consistent than the second [season], but without the freshness of the first, the show is still a blast, but starting to think they shouldn't stretch it any much longer. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 has learned the best lessons from its predecessors. The Umbrella Academy is now the best version of itself: fun, witty, and stylish, more comfortable in its quirks and flourishes, and with a stronger sense of how best to use its growing ensemble."
The Umbrella Academy,1,[Keeps] the Hargreeves' adventures feeling fresh with powerful new character developments and a fun set of villains to face off against.
The Umbrella Academy,1,Think Wes Anderson meets Curb Your Enthusiasm – with a sprinkling of “biff pow!” comic book excitement stirred through.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 takes plenty of chances and nails a few of them. The inclusion of The Sparrow Academy is somewhat underwhelming, but there are more than a few great moments and characters to come from that."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The second half of the season speeds up quite a bit with the last three episodes hitting the accelerator to their finale, leaving me wanting more, sooner rather than later. Full review in Spanish."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"If perhaps the weakest season so far by a nose, The Umbrella Academy’s third go-around largely reaffirms the show’s singularly irreverent spirit."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The third season of has many ups and downs, but it will be highly enjoyable for fans of the characters and the general tone. While it retains the mind-bending time-jump horror of the source material, it struggles with handling so many characters"
The Umbrella Academy,1,The Umbrella Academy has found a formula that works and manages to make it feel new each time. I enjoyed this season quite a bit because it offered a return to established characters but manages to make them even more interesting than before.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Even if a lot of Season 3 feels like downtime, it’s still largely enjoyable downtime, thanks to a cast that understands their characters and how to play off of one another."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"While The Umbrella Academy borrows plot points from Way and Bá’s The Umbrella Academy: Hotel Oblivion, Netflix’s series is much more interested in digging deeper into its own continuity that showrunner Steve Blackman takes in surprising new directions."
The Umbrella Academy,1,It’s intriguing to see different arcs for each sibling based on the traumas they’ve experienced in previous seasons. The show handles the mix of emotions and overall stunted and complex love each sibling has for both themselves and others well.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"A compelling whirlwind of action that often sacrifices character beats and emotional weight for convoluted plot developments, but, nevertheless, remains a lot of fun."
The Umbrella Academy,1,The series’ rhythm and joyous moments set against the brute realities they face are beautifully composed and balanced.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Three seasons in, the writers have finally ironed out all of those kinks, creating a hilarious, explosive, and highly addictive hit. This is the best season yet, one that will floor fans and win over any cynics."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Gets off to a great start, but falls apart halfway through. Klaus still gets a fantastic storyline, however fellow fan favorite Five is basically benched while Allison suffers character assassination. Elliot Page's transition is handled respectfully."
The Umbrella Academy,1,Season 3 is a frustrating mix ... delivering exceptional arcs for certain characters while making baffling decisions with others.
The Umbrella Academy,0,The writers seem happy to undercut their big turns and moves without really mining them for their full emotional worth.
The Umbrella Academy,1,"It may initially seem less inventive and action-packed than previous seasons, but what it loses in wackiness, it gains in heart and the clarity of its message -- one that resonates whether your family is screwing up the timeline or not."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 blends together the moodiness of Season 1 with the brisk-pacing, bizarro nature, and enormous heart of Season 2. In fact, the third season of The Umbrella Academy may just be the most emotional and personal season yet."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The talent it takes to balance the varying tones and madness of The Umbrella Academy is vast. And then there is such tenderness, so much love that bleeds but glows at the precipice of disaster."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"This season might be the weakest of the three, yet it remains a wholly entertaining series that is unlike anything else being produced on television. It's a shame that Netflix doesn't want the world to enjoy it to its fullest potential."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"Season 3 doesn’t fully come together, once again providing more questions than answers, but it remains an enjoyable — if muddled — adventure."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"With a whole new family with new powers to get to know, this season is jam packed with action and drama. In true The Umbrella Academy fashion, the end of the season doesn’t feel like an ending at all, but rather a beginning for season four."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The Umbrella Academy does a heroic job of balancing its massive ensemble—but this time around, it’s a little too big."
The Umbrella Academy,1,"The Umbrella Academy season three is another brilliantly bonkers instalment, pairing the trademark dysfunctional-yet-touching family dynamics with fantastic fight sequences & another banging soundtrack."
The Umbrella Academy,1,Season three is still a lot of fun and absolutely worth your time. Just don't listen to any rumours that suggest these new episodes improve on what's come before.
Man vs. Bee,1,"Man vs Bee is the most harmless piece of comedy he has been involved in. Unless, of course, you’re a bee. Anyway, don’t pretend there aren’t worse things on Netflix."
Man vs. Bee,1,"... Beyond its basic simplicity, the series suffers from blandness and easy gags. [Full review in Spanish]"
Man vs. Bee,0,There’s something dispiriting about Atkinson’s determination to play idiotic characters incapable of accomplishing routine tasks without burning down the house or ruining very valuable works of art
Man vs. Bee,1,Hilariously entertaining comedy series from the legendary Rowan Atkinson. A simple but effective premise that delivers the utmost humor and havoc.
Man vs. Bee,0,"Despite its enticing if predictable premise, Man vs. Bee lacks a sting in its tail."
Man vs. Bee,1,Pink Panther (1969) but with Mr. Bean. [Full review in Spanish]
Man vs. Bee,1,You certainly need to be in the mood to laugh at slapstick in order to enjoy Man Vs. Bee. But there is no one on the planet who does slapstick better than Rowan Atkinson...
Man vs. Bee,1,"Man vs. Bee is a pure throwback to the slapstick comedies of old. It’s a breeze to binge, and Atkinson is at the top of his game."
Man vs. Bee,0,"It’s always a bad sign when a comedian resorts to dog doody for a laugh, yet that’s the level Rowan Atkinson sinks to here. And he doesn’t step in it, he face-plants it. This, from the guy who gave us Mr Bean and Blackadder? That's not funny. That’s sad."
Man vs. Bee,0,"While Atkinson’s performance is as commandingly skilful as you would expect, at times it is about as much fun as a boot stamping on a human face for ever, to borrow from George Orwell."
Man vs. Bee,1,"t’s a surprisingly good -- if one-note -- comedy fit for family viewing, and it made me laugh out loud multiple times."
Man vs. Bee,1,"Atkinson has lost none of his skill and you will watch it quite happily, but it just lacks the genius of Mr Bean."
Man vs. Bee,1,"As you’d expect from a Netflix production, it’s smartly produced and directed, and Atkinson as Bingley is much more engaging than Bean, and is still game enough to spend much of his time on screen in his underpants."
Man vs. Bee,0,"Imagine Parasite, if Parasite was the worst thing you’d seen in your life."
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
Man vs. Bee,1,"I’ve always felt, I now realise wrongly, that Atkinson’s best comedy was verbal and that Mr Bean and Johnny English were chiefly of interest to the lucrative dimwit demographic. What I should have appreciated is the continuity of Atkinson’s oeuvre."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Stranger Things,1,Stranger Things continues to deliver and has come just in time for a studio that needs a viable hit and is a pop culture phenomenon that still feels worthy of discussion.  [Full review in Spanish]
Stranger Things,1,"More, more, more. If this really is the end of the Netflix era, Stranger Things 4 threw the kind of Irish wake that requires a fire engine."
Stranger Things,1,I can't wait to be surprised by this inventive and bold series yet again.
Stranger Things,1,"Born in 1984, the Duffer Brothers have an uncanny grasp of what was happening during their toddlerhood and can locate the charm in pop cheesiness. This makes for era-specific comic relief that’s also timeless."
Stranger Things,1,"While the series is a wonderful, immersive thing, one can assume that these feature film-length episodes will seem interminable to anyone who isn’t a fan."
Stranger Things,1,This excellent penultimate season of Netflix's golden goose is the perfect antidote to lowest common denominator television: a show that offers much more than its audience asks for.
Stranger Things,0,"The whole experience felt like being forced to eat every menu item from the Cheesecake Factory over the course of a day: lots of deliciousness, some things you never wanted, and the whole experience leaving you feeling nothing but bloated."
Stranger Things,1,It’s to the show’s credit that its simultaneous shock-and-awe campaign and softer character beats don’t cancel each other out.
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things, no longer just a show about monsters or the retro novelty of cassette Walkmans, is exploring within its highly stylised parameters what its audiences really care about: the depths of the self and the complexities of human experience."
Stranger Things,1,"The show has matured past riffing on early-80s action-adventure movies, such as The Goonies; now, it's onto slashers and other horror films, complete with new characters called Fred and Jason. And with that, Stranger Things also gets bloodier and eerier."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things is still good. While it might have lost some of its initial shine, the performances, the chemistry, the story, it’s all still there."
Stranger Things,1,"The scares and the heart abound in season four, making it largely a success, though the remaining two episodes will be the real indicator if the writers got lost in excess."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things is still exercising its ability to be an entertaining, influential, and indicative coalescence of horror, fantasy, and the challenges that come with growing up."
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
Stranger Things,1,Once it hits its stride... you're on a ride.
Stranger Things,1,"Like Stephen King, [the Duffer brothers] take all the pop culture they consumed as children and bring it back to life... [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,Lots of monsters and monster action but it all seems a bit repetitive. Plus there are four plots and locales to of which to keep track. Still fun though.
Stranger Things,0,"The latest season of ‘Stranger Things’ may have some issues with bloated running times and narrative continuity, but hey, at least Steve Harrington continues to be charming as hell, right?"
Stranger Things,1,"In its fourth outing, Netflix’s marquee series is badly in need of streamlining, but that’s not to say it is time wasted."
Stranger Things,1,"This isn’t a perfect season so far–that overstuffing can lead to tonal whiplash and an occasionally dragging pace. However, it’s the closest to perfection since season 1."
Stranger Things,1,The season needed to separate everyone for all the pieces to come together... letting different characters take the lead or take a step back depending on the storyline. The growing friendships make the series more well-rounded.
Stranger Things,1,"It offers an unabashed spectacle that commands emotional investment, and more than a few frights along the way. It’s not flawless but it’s always pushing itself."
Stranger Things,1,Season four captures all of the magic — and horror — of the best parts of the series.
Stranger Things,1,"One of the better seasons of Stranger Things, offers more horror and higher stakes within its most ambitious story yet. [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,"If season 4 never quite delivers the gleeful sugar highs of 3, it nonetheless stays on track more satisfyingly."
Stranger Things,1,The editing in the first episode alone is incredible -- with multiple narrative strands intercut in a way that takes months and an army of assistants to make work. It's also a treat to see the themes and inspirations in this new series emerge.
Stranger Things,1,"Amid the show’s ballooning scale and scope, Stranger Things finds an unexpected anchor not in its ensemble of fan favorites but in its latest villain."
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
Stranger Things,1,The Duffer Brothers really swung for the fences this season. They were mostly successful.
Stranger Things,1,"On the whole, Stranger Things Season 4 is pretty good. Sometimes even pretty great."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things remains both true to its origins and takes a detour into lands unknown, settling into a gripping, bloodied version of itself that isn’t afraid to take a few gambles to experiment with its own voice."
Stranger Things,1,"The show’s writers have brought their A-game to the table, writing some of the funniest and scariest scenes in the show to-date. It’s also more mysterious than ever, with genuinely interesting mysteries to solve and trails of breadcrumbs to follow."
Stranger Things,1,"Overall, Stranger Things Season Four feels like it set itself up to be ambitious and is almost there. It has some of the best storytelling of the series since Season One and has some big payoffs for longtime fans."
Stranger Things,1,The pieces on the chessboard are placed decisively and intelligently... [Full review in Spanish]
Stranger Things,1,"The darkest, most wide-reaching chapter in the saga so far."
Stranger Things,1,Best season yet.
Stranger Things,1,I cannot wait to see how things shake out with the Hawkins gang when the series returns in July. I just wish we didn’t have to sit through even longer episodes with the rest of the stories to get there.
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things Season 4 is dedicatedly macabre and menacing, its deadly ambitions and volatile tempo keeps the mood edge-of-the-seat."
Stranger Things,1,"Goes darker and deeper in terms of its mythology and character development, though its lengthy runtime feels like a test of endurance at times."
Stranger Things,1,"The '80s horror influences inspired the Duffer brothers to make a tonal shift from the prior seasons, easily making Stranger Things 4 the darkest and longest — and possibly most entertaining — entry yet."
Stranger Things,1,"Even if you watch at a casual pace, this is still a highly entertaining, meticulously-constructed serving."
Stranger Things,1,"Like its characters, it’s still growing — no matter how un-photogenic the journey."
Stranger Things,1,"It doesn't pull its punches, but it also enriches the background and history... It has the dread and danger you had in the first couple seasons, but it also had the whimsy and fun with the characters."
Stranger Things,1,"The elements of classic horror coexist with suspense, it is no longer a fiction for the little ones, it is much darker."
Stranger Things,1,"Of course, those completely enamored with the show might decide there's no such thing as too much of a good thing, and Stranger Things rewards them with a fresh assortment of pop-culture references and homages."
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
Stranger Things,1,"While the reveal of the big bad on the show has had a slower build in the past, this doesn’t take away from Vecna’s ability to strike fear into the hearts of the characters and viewers alike."
Stranger Things,1,The new terror is one of the most horrifying creations yet from show creators and writers Matt and Ross Duffer. …this season features some of the most gore-infused moments to date.
Stranger Things,1,"Not only has our young cast grown up, but so too has the series, bringing along a richer story, a genuine sense of foreboding and a chance for the cast and its characters to develop further."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Stranger Things,1,"There’s so much story, so many people to follow, and so many locations... that what Season 4 is no longer resembles the story of the plucky group of middle schoolers and their telekinetic friends saving the world like it did during the first two seasons."
Stranger Things,1,"None of it is bad, and a lot of it is mostly fine. Those who have stuck with it for this long will probably find plenty to enjoy. They'll just be sitting there for 13 hours watching a story unfold that could have been done in half that time"
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things’ fourth season doesn’t go down as smoothly as its earlier entries, yet respectably attempts to do something different, even as it gets bogged down in major narrative bloat."
Stranger Things,1,"Four seasons in, I reckon it has never been better."
Stranger Things,1,"The Duffers... channel Spielberg and delay the evil appearance, just like Steven did in JAWS. [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,"Neither entirely a TV series nor a series of movies, it’s something stranger. But as this show has repeatedly demonstrated since its debut, sometimes strange is exactly what we need."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things is bigger, older, somewhat sadder – and as lovable as ever."
Stranger Things,1,"There were a lot of things in here that I was looking at through childlike eyes. Kids will grow up loving Stranger Things the way I grew up loving Dracula, Frankenstein, Godzilla, etc."
Stranger Things,0,"What we're left with is a disjointed poorer show. One that's trying to go in various directions, but doesn't always have the room for it, despite the crazy runtimes. I'm afraid Stranger Things 4 has gotten too big for its own good."
Stranger Things,1,"Fun, engrossing, full of jump scares and nostalgic adventure, continues to be one of the best Netflix productions. Full review in Spanish."
Stranger Things,1,"Season 4 Volume 1 is the most ambitious, suspenseful and bloody instalment of sci-fi horror yet from the Duffer Brothers."
Stranger Things,0,This volume of the Stranger Things saga could use some of the humor and warmth that made the show such a clever blend of nostalgia and fantasy.
Stranger Things,1,"Because we’re so deeply entrenched with these characters, it makes it easier to overlook the strain the ambitious scale places on the season. It helps that it's a darker, more mature season that embraces horror harder than before."
Stranger Things,1,The good news is that much of this season captures what people appreciate about the show. The bad news is it also struggles with much of what has disappointed viewers.
Stranger Things,1,The Duffer brothers deliver another addictive outing..the series forges a new and notably darker path.
Stranger Things,1,"Although the tonal shifts don't prevent the series from being as entertaining as when it premiered, this time [around] the particular mixture of nostalgia with odes to pop culture has lost its effectiveness. [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,"You can feel the show’s narrative engine, fuelled by nostalgia for the era’s films and a blithe mix of horror set-pieces and flippant dialogue, slowly revving up, but the wait is excruciating in part... You just have to be patient getting there."
Stranger Things,1,"It's not a dud, this fourth run."
Stranger Things,1,"Longer, bloodier, and scarier. This complex and brutally violent string of episodes provides ample frights and a frustrating wait until the season's movie length final two episodes that are arriving in July."
Stranger Things,1,Stranger Things is a comedic-horror party mix that keeps delivering on everything you loved about the series from the start (you just have to know when to cover your eyes)
Stranger Things,0,It feels both overstuffed and slackly paced at the same time.
Stranger Things,1,"What you can guarantee though are copious thrills, more than a couple of truly creepy moments and plenty of 1980s pop-culture references for Gen-Xers like myself to revel in."
Stranger Things,1,"For every welcome moment of dread and (fortunately) equal moment of comedy, not to mention some cool monsters, there are sequences that remind us of just how much is going on. It’s a lot to remember, but if you’re a diehard, it’s no doubt worth it."
Stranger Things,0,"The new season stretches out the most basic plot lines beyond their breaking point, the most unbearably dull belonging to David Harbour’s former chief of police Hopper. He cheated death during last season’s finale to end up in narrative purgatory."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things 4 is the most cinematic season we have seen yet, as every episode feels like a movie. There is a lot happening, but the way it all comes together down the stretch is brilliant."
Stranger Things,1,"The Indiana-set supernatural thriller series is back for a fourth and final season as the plucky kids, now all grown up, once again fight evil from the Upside Down."
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Stranger Things,1,"Length notwithstanding, “Stranger Things” Season 4 Volume 1 is an epic watch, albeit an uneven one."
Stranger Things,1,"It’s clear the Duffers have the daunting task to up the ante with bigger and bolder creative decisions. As they toggle back and forth between all of these threads, I’m hoping they coalesce together more as the season progresses."
Stranger Things,1,Stranger Things 4 is a binge-worthy blast from the past that is surprisingly relevant in our present reality.
Stranger Things,1,Netflix and the Duffer Brothers have essentially produced nine feature films and rarely has a show made as triumphant a return as Stranger Things has with this outstanding season.
Stranger Things,1,"The series builds a crescendo that reaches the level of gigantic blockbusters, but it does lack the dose of boldness in the end that would take 'Stranger Things' to another level. [Full review in Spanish]"
Stranger Things,1,"Season 4 may not be the best the show has ever been, but it’s definitely the most the show has ever been."
Stranger Things,1,"It doesn’t have the very specific weirdness of Season 1, the assault-on-all-fronts feel of Season 2, or the summer fun of Season 3. That being said, it is still so enjoyable to spend time with these characters again and combat a hair-raising new threat..."
Stranger Things,1,"The show is still loaded with smartly placed pop culture references from the era, stand-up-and-cheer moments of showmanship, and emotional crescendos."
Stranger Things,0,"""Stranger Things"" is back after a three-year hiatus, but it's hard to say it's a welcome arrival."
Stranger Things,1,"There’s still a lot to enjoy about Season 4, and “Stranger Things” remains an entertaining show. But, it also feels like it’s biting off more than it can chew."
Stranger Things,1,"It’s hard not to get swept up in the warm, cozy blanket of these familiar settings and endearing characters, and the sweeping blockbuster nature of the thing. Like a lot of the previous seasons, Season 4 remains a cozy retread of familiar ground."
Stranger Things,1,"There’s a lot to love about Stranger Things Season 4, especially when it comes to some of the character progression and the change in vibe which fully embraces the tropes of the best of ‘80s horror."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things season four might be unwieldy and imperfect, but it’s also absorbing in its scale and creativity. It's about as big as event TV gets."
Stranger Things,1,"It may have more characters than it knows what to do with, but Stranger Things’ most sinister season yet still knows how to send shivers up your spine."
Stranger Things,1,"This season is bigger, scarier, and darker than its predecessors and I feel confident saying that it's the best season yet."
Stranger Things,1,Season 4 may just be the best one yet which shows how well the cast and crew have done creating something worthwhile.
Stranger Things,1,"For me, this is a perfect followup to season 3 and a great continuation of the story."
Stranger Things,1,"This is bingeable television at its finest: propulsive, nostalgic and addictive. Well worth a sunny Saturday spent on the sofa."
Stranger Things,1,"A long, scattered ride that's at times disappointing given its reputation as a streaming blockbuster that's too big to fail. But it is still very much Stranger Things, and reuniting with its characters is enough to make it enjoyable."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things has always been walking a line between tribute and pastiche, and it sometimes ends up on the wrong side. The strange thing is that this cast remains so charming, I don’t really mind watching them going through the motions."
Stranger Things,1,"As Stranger Things 4 evokes the satanic panic that gripped pearl-clutching ‘80s parents who didn’t understand why people would want to fight dragons in dungeons, you get the sense this is the direction the Duffer Brothers always planned to take the show."
Stranger Things,1,"Part 1 is incredible - movie level entertainment.  The delay is made well worth it with basically a nine hour movie, or if you're smart a movie for 4 nights in a row.  Too good to binge, savor this. The new cast members are particularly good."
Stranger Things,1,"With season 4, Stranger Things retains being one of the compelling new shows in this generation’s zeitgeist. A season that excites, intrigues and is highly satisfying from beginning to end. Well, almost the end."
Stranger Things,1,"“Stranger Things” might be bigger and more expensive than ever, but it hasn’t lost its touch and hasn’t forgotten where it came from."
Stranger Things,1,"This season’s directors, including Matt and Ross Duffer, Shawn Levy, and Nimród Antal, utilize every space and factor to reflect the narrative’s nostalgic time and dazzle the loyal fans with the elaborate, emotional roller-coaster of a script."
Stranger Things,0,"The scrappy, soulful energy that defined Stranger Things‘ early seasons has been thrown out the window, and all that’s left is a parade of ’80s movies Easter eggs and increasingly obvious plot twists."
Stranger Things,1,This fourth season is the strongest since the first and delivers the scariest and most action-packed run to date. Stranger Things 4 once again is about to claim the title of The Show of the Summer and I cannot wait to see how it will end.
Stranger Things,1,"Suffers from some growing pains early on, but once the series finds its grooves, it takes it horrors to new levels and deepens the complex history of Hawkins."
Stranger Things,1,"Ultimately, <I>Stranger Things season 4</I> is more of the same, with emphasis on more. It’s hard to blame the show for wanting to give us more because the formula they’ve created works."
Stranger Things,1,"There's no sense of bloat to Stranger Things Season 4, despite the supercharged episodes."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things season 4 volume 2 came for our throats with family feels, honest moments full of love, and incredible story building we can’t stop thinking about. Were the two episodes a bit long? Absolutely. But were they worth it? Without a doubt."
Stranger Things,1,A summer blockbuster in TV form.
Stranger Things,1,"In a remarkably plotted and well-paced fourth season, Stranger Things marks a new level of sophistication in its technical and creative visions. ... This is not just another season of a popular TV show, but a piece of mainstream art with something to say."
Stranger Things,1,"The charms and gruesome horrors are still there and as effective as ever, but with seven episodes all hovering around feature film length, but...the sheer size and scope is enough to test even the most devoted fan."
Stranger Things,1,"Fresh locales, appealing new characters, and a rewarding expansion of the mythology give the new season of Stranger Things a jolt of joyful energy, just when the series needed it most."
Stranger Things,1,"Stranger Things Season 4 Part 1 is the show at its most ambitious in every way, and that ambition works far more than it doesn’t."
Stranger Things,0,"For every fun and exciting element introduced, there is an overwhelming mushy gray pile of slog to wade through."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 feels like it’s been designed to produce good data rather than quality entertainment.
Stranger Things,1,"If you liked Stranger Things before, you’ll like it again this time around. Formulaic TV works when the formula is this good."
Stranger Things,1,"Unless you’re for some reason dying for a reinvention of the wheel, you’re gonna love this. It’s suspenseful, exciting, funny and scary as hell."
Stranger Things,1,The Duffer Brothers’ own superpower is reveling in ’80s horror nostalgia. And the duo is on top of their game here.
Stranger Things,1,"The story soon picks up into a fever pitch of peak Stranger Things, with a narrative so irresistibly compelling that it becomes a compulsory binge."
Stranger Things,1,"It’s fair to say there are entire storylines this season I don’t care about at all. But it’s also fair to say that, even if bloated, there are still a lot of things about “Stranger Things” I like."
Stranger Things,1,"The biggest, scariest, most ambitious Stranger Things season yet. It’s also the least charming, least funny and least inventive season yet..."
Stranger Things,1,"Too much? Not a bit of it. Stranger Things is a 1980s Americana theme park, and it is all the better when it embraces that fact."
Stranger Things,1,Whenever “Stranger Things” does go back to Hawkins and what it does best... it’s easier to forgive some detours.
Stranger Things,1,"Intense, frightening, and nightmare inducing, this is by far the best season yet. It's long, but never slows down. Get ready for permanent goosebumps!"
Stranger Things,1,The mystery in the centre of the season is so addictive that makes this show the main victim of Netflix's binge watching model. Every episode would bring some wonderful debates and conversation. [Full review in Spanish]
Stranger Things,1,"The main characters are in high school with different problems than they had in childhood, but equally universal ones. Fitting in is still relevant, but many of them now deal with their first relationships."
Stranger Things,1,"Some storylines are stronger than others, but it's still an utter thrill and joy to be reunited with these characters. Of the bunch, the situation unfolding in Hawkins is the standout with some especially impressive work from Sadie Sink as Max."
Peaky Blinders,1,"Peaky Blinders returns in fairly bonkers style for its handsome, cinematic fever dream of a final season."
Peaky Blinders,1,"The series, Peaky Blinders shines because it’s complex, thoughtful to watch, and forces us to think about morals and the greyness between right and wrong. It’s hard to mindlessly watch the show, which is what makes it compelling. It’ll be missed."
Peaky Blinders,1,"Thomas Shelby knows that with each day he's more alive, more human, and as a result, closer to death. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peaky Blinders,1,"Steeped in blood, sopped in whiskey, and lit in brooding pools of yellow and gray, Peaky Blinders is mood TV escapism with a satisfying historical bent."
Peaky Blinders,1,"While this final official season of “Peaky Blinders” lacks a total sense of finality, it’s still a riveting watch."
Peaky Blinders,1,Peaky Blinders goes out in predictably thrilling fashion.
Peaky Blinders,1,... It doesn't taste like a definitive end. There are still things to be told. [Full review in Spanish]
Peaky Blinders,1,"Our need to suspend our disbelief has only increased... But at least its increasingly sweeping, operatic feel and expansive, usually extremely explosive setpieces mean that Peaky Blinders is many things, but it is certainly never dull."
Peaky Blinders,1,The final season wrangles peril and occasional pathos out of its increasingly political narrative.
Peaky Blinders,1,"...for all that climaxs catharsis, it seems too much like they waited as long as possible to set it off because they couldnt quite bear to actually move things forward."
Peaky Blinders,1,"One could say that Peaky Blinders is the triumph of style over substance, but what’s wrong with style?"
Peaky Blinders,1,"The pieces are in position, and Peaky Blinders presents its players -- and its audience -- with a new game plan. Let’s see it if it works."
Peaky Blinders,1,"It’s all here. The violence, yes, but also the flat caps, the undercut hairdos that have become inexplicably popular, the Birmingham burr, the contemporary music, the slo-mo, the gloomy oppressiveness."
Peaky Blinders,1,Peaky Blinders is a resounding victory for style over substance.
Peaky Blinders,1,It’s solid bingewatching melodrama. Easy to mock. But we’ll miss it when it’s gone.
Peaky Blinders,1,"While it seems the right time to retire Peaky Blinders it still has that heavy, clunking stamp of quality, the unique mix of early 20th-century gangsterism set against modern music and reassuringly uncorny dialogue."
Peaky Blinders,1,"While it has stumbled occasionally, Peaky Blinders has built an army of devoted followers. If this firing on all cylinders opener is a guide, this could be the best series yet."
Peaky Blinders,1,"This was the Peaky Blinders we have fallen in love with over the past nine years -- a dark, gloomy, tense, intricately planned (but never too complicated) show, full of exceptional performances and the underhand machinations of a loveable rogue gangster."
Peaky Blinders,1,"In Peaky Blinders, every scene -- every line -- is somehow vital... Peaky Blinders is its own world, to the degree that its frequent anachronisms hardly dent its sides."
Peaky Blinders,1,"The beginning of the end of one of the great British TV drama achievements of recent years is as movingly intimate, cinematically ambitious and sweepingly epic as ever."
Peaky Blinders,1,"Sadly, Series 6 has lost something of its soul without the presence of thunderous matriarch Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory), but there are some treats in store."
Peaky Blinders,1,I’m not worried: Knight has form for keeping things simmering until a boiling point crescendo and we’re only at the very start of the show’s curtain call.
Peaky Blinders,1,"This idiosyncratic style, held together by Cillian Murphy’s flawless lead performance as the antihero mob boss Tommy Shelby, is precisely what has made Peaky Blinders such fun."
Peaky Blinders,1,"What a pleasure it is to see Beau Brummies strut their heteronormative, masculinist stuff."
Peaky Blinders,1,Immediately absorbing...
Peaky Blinders,1,It’s clever – both predictable and yet exciting at the same time.
You Don't Know Me,1,"The well-written, skillfully told four-part crime series offers an engaging narrative that never quite ends."
You Don't Know Me,1,You Don’t Know Me is a pretty smart crime show told in a way that feels completely unnecessary.
You Don't Know Me,1,"The supporting cast are uniformly strong, especially Nsengiyumva as a gangster with a few surprises up his sleeve, but the whole thing revolves around Adewunmi."
You Don't Know Me,1,"The jarring twists of fate and gobsmacking personality-shifts of the protagonists are (if we're honest) a bit daft, but the piece is kept airborne by convincing performances from Nsengiyumva and Adewunmi in particular."
You Don't Know Me,1,I've awarded it four stars because the conceit is different and makes you think -- can someone be morally in the right while legally in the wrong? -- and the performances were all so strong.
Heartstopper,1,"Plunges so convincingly and inclusively into its characters' experiences that it feels like its heart is constantly bursting with affection for everything they do, want, hope for, dream of, pine over and go through."
Heartstopper,1,"An adorkable adaptation by comic creator Alice Oseman, featuring two incredibly charming leads. The suggestion that this is an ""ideal"" for queer media is disconcerting, but there's plenty to appreciate in the diversity, inclusion and stunt casting"
Heartstopper,1,"The style of the series may be nothing new—animated leaves, hearts, and sparks swoop around lovestruck characters like generic indie fare, the sad ballads drive one montage after the next—but there is plenty that is refreshing about how it’s all told."
Heartstopper,1,Heartstopper is nothing short of a minor miracle: a wish-fulfillment fantasy that yields more truths about the human condition than many more realistic portraits of adolescence.
Heartstopper,1,"Netflix’s attempt to make the queer public forget about Dave Chappelle’s descent into hacky transphobia, Heartstopper, is a pleasant YA series that would have meant the world to me as a teen."
Heartstopper,1,"For any adult who recalls surviving high school years as a gay, lesbian or questioning kid, it’s the valentine we never got."
Heartstopper,1,Director Euros Lyn has a gentle touch with Oseman’s material riding a fine line of truly understanding these characters and wanting the best in how we perceive of them.
Heartstopper,1,Adorable.
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper’s focus on the emotional dimensions of relationships allows it to plumb the characters’ interiority, delving into their confusion without leaping to despair."
Heartstopper,1,"It may not be realistic, but, then again, perhaps it’s worth questioning how revelatory any teen TV made by adults can really be."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is naturally an important show for queer teens, but the reason why even parents of straight teens should watch the show together is that it depicts just how harmful homophobia is, without it getting too dark."
Heartstopper,1,A portrait of adolescence… teaches us to learn and love freely without prejudice.
Heartstopper,1,"'Heartstopper' is a must-see for young LGBTQ people to realize that it is more than acceptable to be yourself, regardless of who you are or who you choose to love. For the older generation, let it be a reminder that progress is happening."
Heartstopper,1,"Whether you're a queer teen, the parent of a queer teen, or just wanting to escape pandemic and political related dreariness – this joyful show will provide all the warm fuzzies necessary for a winter evening."
Heartstopper,1,"It’s hard to be a human in the year 2022, and so we all need our little treats. Mine, this past month, was Heartstopper."
Heartstopper,1,"The series is created and written by the brilliantly subversive Alice Oseman. Her secret ingredient is to treat her characters in the most authentic manner possible, eschewing all notions of expected scripted TV tropes."
Heartstopper,1,"This teen romance is as sweet and lovable as a puppy, drenched in wholesome emotions and stocked with good-hearted characters trying, and usually doing, their best."
Heartstopper,1,"When Ive spoken to friends who have seen the show, there is a weird melancholy after you finish watching. That melancholy is evident because I think for some people in their 30s, or in their 20s, or who arent in school any more, they never had this."
Heartstopper,1,"There are some TV series so sweet, so joyous and so wonderful that the mere mention of them can make you smile. Netflix's ""Heartstopper"" is one of those shows."
Heartstopper,1,"This is one of the most important shows in recent years because it gives LGBTQ+ kids, and the adults in their lives, new tools to deal and speak about their identities, choosing hope instead of darkness. Full review in Spanish"
Heartstopper,1,"his is a sweet and endearing story of ""boy meets boy"", as they try to cope with the struggles of their own sexualities, first love, and GCSEs."
Heartstopper,1,"It is phenomenal, and everything about it lives up to its title."
Heartstopper,1,An enchanting and vibrant adaption of Alice Oseman’s popular series.
Heartstopper,1,"There is a joy to these eight episodes, to their gentleness and tension, that radiates too brightly to be rejected. They comprise four hours of happiness and hope."
Heartstopper,1,"Each actor is perfectly cast, but Connor (who appeared in 2019’s Rocketman and voices Pantalaimon in HBO’s His Dark Materials) is particularly strong as Nick, the popular rugby player grappling with his burgeoning bisexuality."

Heartstopper,1,"It might sound saccharine, but the skill with which Heartstopper captures these very earnest emotions seems to be able to melt even the coldest and most cynical of hearts."
Heartstopper,1,"The series has its serious moments, but at the heart of it is a story that makes sure to treat its queer characters with care."
Heartstopper,1,This is an ideal series for anyone in high school who feels the pangs of being different. It’s realistic but never bitter. You’ll fall for it just like Charlie and Nick fall for each other.
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper introduces itself through brilliant cinematography, a cotton-candy color palette, and perfectly poignant needle drops at every turn."
Heartstopper,1,"While Heartstopper certainly doesn’t reinvent the wheel, covering the heavily-trafficked topics of coming out and bullying, the series still finds ways to be fresh and heart-warming."
Heartstopper,1,Heartstopper heavily thrives off of the fact that there is no right way to come out. It dives into self-discovery in an authentic and careful way by portraying the fears and the catharsis that comes with exploring your identity.
Heartstopper,1,Heartstopper aces this portrayal of the bashful hope and gutting anxiety that accompanies young love. But the show isn’t just aimed at an adolescent crowd.
Heartstopper,1,"Its feel-good, without being contrived, or ignoring any of the challenges of coming of age as an LGBTQ teen."
Heartstopper,1,Heartstopper tells a gentle story about teens falling for each other in a way that makes even the issues they’ll face in their friendship and relationship just part of growing up. And that’s quite a refreshing way to approach that kind of story.
Heartstopper,1,This show is lovely. Charlie and Nick’s friendship and possible something-more-ship is a joy to watch in a simple kind of way that will melt as many hearts as it stops.
Heartstopper,1,"It's super powerful that this simple, beautiful love story can go on to impact so many young people who now have a chance to see themselves represented. Heartstopper is so genuine and positive in celebrating LGBTQ+ characters and their love stories."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper may not quite live up to the dramatic promise of its title, but this adorable teen romance is a heartwarmer, at the very least."
Heartstopper,1,A coming-of-age story notable above all for its sweetness... Heartstopper’s dulcet tone is addictive.
Heartstopper,1,"I'm so grateful that Heartstopper exists. Because if you can't see yourself in the world around you, it's hard to see a future for yourself too. And no one should ever be made to feel like that."
Heartstopper,1,"But its secret is its earnest heart, sensitivity, and sense of empathy; its easy to imagine many young people being able to find themselves through this show, and its hard to think of a better compliment to pay it than that."
Heartstopper,1,"With the warmth of bright sunlight and the liveliness of mixed pastels and neons, Oseman’s deftly written script has a certain lightness about it that doesn’t sacrifice watchability, an achievement in itself."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a wonderfully sweet story for teens across the spectrum of queerness. It is multiculti, bright, tangible, and a really lovely maybe-might-be-in-love story."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a wonderfully sweet queer story for teens across the spectrum of queerness. It is multiculti, bright, tangible, and a really lovely maybe-might-be-in-love story."
Heartstopper,1,"“Heartstopper” captures the joys and agonies of being a teen, when every stray text can make a profound impact, and being able to announce you are “going out with” someone means everything."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper offers up warmth and safety that reaches out and says ""youll be okay.""...If there is one thing that Heartsoppper does, its that it presents audiences with a blueprint for healthy friendships and romantic relationships."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a wonderfully heartwarming, tender and game-changing coming-of-age romance which will undoubtedly win over a whole new fan base."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is upbeat and gentle, full of sunlight and bright colours, with a welcome lightness of touch. Maybe the best way to describe it is to say that its a very inviting series  nice, in the most earnest and least dismissive sense of the word."
Heartstopper,1,"If anything, the only thing wrong with Heartstopper is its name: rather than stopping your heart, this perfect first season will get it beating again."
Heartstopper,1,"Heartstopper is a truly comforting, uplifting teen dramedy that's so loaded up on subtle moments of friendship and romance that your ticker will likely cease functioning at points."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"Themes regarding traditionalism versus globalism abound in the series, and tell a uniquely Korean story."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"On the whole, the interplay between these distinctions and dichotomies provides more than enough reason to give this series a chance."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,A disappointment that I've no interest in perpetuating. [Full review in Spanish]
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The biggest struggle comes from seeing the exact same story beats play out in a remake that is not too far removed from the original. The quality storytelling is there, but it will be interesting to see how it continues to distinguish itself."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"Money Heist: Korea brings up all of the same haves and have-nots issues that drove the Spanish original, but adds in everything that has made Korean dramas like Squid Game popular here in the States."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The end result is a series that’s perhaps best suited for either Money Heist superfans or those entirely new to the franchise. Still, Money Heist: Korea proves to be a compelling watch based on its updated geopolitical context."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The all-star cast is more than capable of delivering the goods. Yet the lack of chemistry between the romantic partners hinders, rather than enhances the plot. Here’s hoping that the second season will focus more on the backstories of the thieves."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,This crossover with the seismic force of Korean content — in the golden age that it is in right now — surely throws open the sheer scope of what Netflix can achieve with its ever-growing library of popular franchises.
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area is ambitious for its plan, exciting for the twists and turns, inviting for its characters, and is just plain addictive."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"This is a series that can stand on its own, compelling in its own right —yes, even with similar beats...Money Heist is expertly crafted to push tension and showcase action while also managing to investigate the way people interact with each other."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,"Basically, it reuses everything that gave personality to the [original] Spanish series and presents us with a copy instead of with an adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]"
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The purpose of Money Heist is to entertain rather than educate, and entertain it does with a story that hums along with all the thrills and twists required of a well-planned and inventively thwarted heist narrative."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,1,"The production is impressive, the script is punchy, and the characters do well to represent their original counterparts."
Borgen,1,It’s one of the first shows I’ve seen to reckon with the decline and fall of the archetype of the girlboss.
Borgen,1,"Add to this the superb acting by principal and supporting actors, and the brilliant, multifaceted performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte, and I have no reservations endorsing the fine political juggling on display in Borgen: Power & Glory."
Borgen,1,"Borgen: Power & Glory is a work of art, somehow towering over the already timeless three seasons of its original run."
Borgen,1,This chapter of Borgen lives up to its lofty reputation of excellence in dramatic television worldwide.
Borgen,1,"It’s a terrific, nuanced portrait of power and its downsides, especially the recognition that, for women in particular, family life does not sit well with a form of governance that nowadays is always “on”."
Borgen,1,"This new series of Borgen, titled Power & Glory, hits every beat, refreshes every memory, and fires every synapse, reminding you just how good Borgen was - and miraculously - still is."
Borgen,1,A contemporary lesson in this narcissist era multiplied by social media. [Full review in Spanish]
Borgen,1,"Welcome back Birgitte, you have been missed."
Borgen,1,"This new Borgen looks like other Scandi-noir dramas that have emerged since its inaugural run, but it is in a league of its own: Crisp, intelligent, and thrillingly addictive."
Borgen,1,"With more grey hairs and less scruples, Brigitte Nyborg is back, and as it happened before, it's impossible not to follow her every footstep. [Full review in Spanish]"
Borgen,1,"Borgen: Power & Glory is a satisfying drama, one that has a lot to say about power, about women and how we’re viewed by society, and about what happens after we reach a certain age."
Borgen,1,All you can do is cross your fingers for her and for the world. But then hope was always Borgen’s renewable resource.
Borgen,1,"Like a 2022 version of The West Wing, it is a fictional antidote to unbearable reality."
Borgen,1,Borgen treats its viewers like intelligent adults -- but adults who aren’t above light soap opera vibes.
Borgen,1,"Ultimately, the primary focus of Borgen remains its leading ladies and the series is wise to keep both Sidse Babett Knudsen and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen front and centre and grounding the show in their performances."
Money Heist,1,"For every wrong move it makes, it gives you a dozen reasons to feel giddy over its sheer audacity and how high its getting off its own genre fumes. It manages to keep stealing you back to its side. That's the real heist."
Money Heist,1,"Unsurprisingly, there isn't a dull moment here: it is once again all vim and vigour and a synthesis of style and substance."
Money Heist,1,"Money Heist had everything to lose... it has won again, and by a landslide. [Full review in Spanish]"
Money Heist,1,The ending it deserves. [Full review in Spanish]
Money Heist,1,"Money Heist has no intention of going quietly. Just like the gang, this acclaimed drama is going to keep up the good fight until its final breath."
Money Heist,0,"There comes a time in the life of a show where the story must end. The formula becomes predictable and the characters wear thin. Money Heist, or La Casa de Papel, has reached this unfortunate point."
Money Heist,1,"However, it's a good formula, there are always twists and you never know which character is going to die."
Money Heist,1,"The intensity continues to pick up as we approach the finale of this series, and season five keeps the momentum going."
Money Heist,1,"The characters engage with the soul. It feels like comfort food. Your heart paces, but you feel at home."
Money Heist,1,I dig smart heist stories. But I don't care much for ones about fictional wars and I'm worried about what Money Heist might become in future episodes. It looks like the show might have changed genres in its final season.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"Keep Sweet brings the critical hindsight this debacle deserves, clarifying an intentionally muddied narrative. But it also highlights the dangers of noncritically accepting the story you’re given."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,Irrefutable proof that human beings need to believe in something. [Full review in Spanish]
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"Outside of this, and some limited archive video and audio, the overall series doesn't offer much about the FLDS or Warren Jeffs that hasn't already been addressed in secular media."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,This engrossing series on Warren Jeffs cult plays out like a horror movie.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"At its best, it plays like an exposé designed less for viewers who would never find themselves in these circumstances than for those whose eyes have yet to be fully opened."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,... A narrative that will make you uncomfortable and angry at the same time.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"This Netflix production adds just enough to merit another return visit, with the understanding that in the current TV environment, it surely won't be the last."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,At a time when American women’s rights are threatened by a wider array of religion-based forces... this straightforward document of how extreme it can get looks pretty necessary.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"Though the four-part series from director Rachel Dretzin is extremely hard to watch at times, the first-hand accounts from survivors are nothing short of awe-inspiring."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,1,"The series largely focuses on the women who, despite almost total lack of knowledge of the outside world, managed to undermine the cult."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"This series seems to aspire to be something in between a workplace comedy and a supernatural romp, and it has its moments, yet as much as we love the actors not every comic premise succeeds."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"More often than not, the show’s sometimes endless willingness to get bogged down in office-life wordplay threatens to render the sublime mundane, rather than the other way around."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"Falcone’s heart is clearly in the right place, but all his goodwill is undone by a narrative that is both too simple and overly convoluted, underdeveloped characters, and chintzy production design."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"One of the worst shows of the year... Everything about this series is jaw-droppingly slack and unambitious, given the talent involved."
God's Favorite Idiot,1,"As funny as McCarthy is, Falcone doesn’t seem to be able to resist the temptation to let her loose before anything about her character can even be established."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"God’s Favorite Idiot is just sad. What a waste of precious time in the career of a talented performer, one whose fans will follow her anywhere, and who rewards them with so little of what she can do."
God's Favorite Idiot,1,"Falcone and McCarthy are great to watch, and the central relationship between their alter egos gives the whole thing enough charm, warmth and heart to get by."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,McCarthy doesn’t star in the series so much as crush it.
God's Favorite Idiot,0,God’s Favorite Idiot feels too casual for its own good.
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"There is nothing particularly novel about the series and its execution, but The Lincoln Lawyer will still effectively deliver your fix of suspenseful legal drama..."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"There's nothing too extraordinary about the series -- it's pretty standard fare. But as far as ""standard"" goes, it's entertaining and light enough to keep you coming back..."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Not quite up to ""Bosch"" level of entertainment yet but getting there fast."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Garcia-Rulfo had a hard act to follow given Matthew McConaughey’s performance in the movie, and at first the newcomer seems too young, too smooth, too handsome to be the ducking and diving Haller. He grows on you, though."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Punchy in its writing and crunchy in its casting, The Lincoln Lawyer is irresistibly entertaining, a Perry Mason for our time."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"The Lincoln Lawyer is fine, but it's nothing special."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"It all makes for a remarkably easy series to binge and, despite the much better shows on television right now, Lincoln Lawyer has a certain Bosch-like feel that makes it ideal weekend viewing."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"It’s not quite as rich as the other new Connelly show Bosch: Legacy, but it’s a solid courtroom drama/detective show -- the closest thing streaming has to Law & Order."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Although the writing is crisp and the storyline intriguing, Lincoln Lawyer doesn’t quite reach the heights of The Practice, Boston Legal or The Good Wife."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,Brings high doses of suspense and crime to an intriguing narrative framework. [Full review in Spanish]
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,It’s pretty good and frequently satisfying. That’s more than I can say about a lot of television.
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"The brisk writing and pace keep it engaging, and it’s certainly more fun than getting called in for jury duty."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,No objection here if Netflix wants to provide a well-acted throwback series complete with likable anti-heroes and colorful suspects.
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Sure, there's always a hard edge underlying these frothier elements -- this is ex-L.A. Times crime reporter Michael Connelly's Los Angeles, after all -- but aesthetically, it's those frothier bits in The Lincoln Lawyer that rise to the top."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Absolute nonsense, of course, from axle to axle. But you can work with it, even if no one’s winning here."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Its appeal comes from being something familiar done very well, and it's the kind of series Netflix should be making all the time."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"It’s easy to relate to this Haller as someone who is incredibly flawed, which makes him very relatable. His performance keeps the audience engaged enough to want to see the story through to its end."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"This series offers an inordinate amount of closure to its storylines by the season’s end, a refreshing change of pace in a Hollywood that constantly feels the need to leave things unfinished and set up the next money grab."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Netflix’s The Lincoln Lawyer will scratch the itch for anyone unexplainably hankering for a tedious, low-stakes legal drama."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"At its best, the Kelley legal drama has real bite and something to say. In The Lincoln Lawyer, working off of a novelist’s script, Kelley amasses incident -- personal and family drama along with court cases -- but doesn’t quite pull it all together."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"The show, written by David E. Kelley, still feels fairly broadcast network-y, albeit slightly elevated. Haller is the half-brother of Harry Bosch and ""Lincoln Lawyer"" feels of a piece with the ""Bosch"" series."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,[A] smart mystery filled with three-dimensional characters and a twister of a case.
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"It's the kind of TV you recognize but a little elevated - crime stories that are perfect for those of us who love the genre but need a little more challenging narrative than your typical ""NCIS"" or ""Chicago P.D."" episode can match."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Come for one man’s charisma, stay for the well-told law thriller, the female characters that never fall into a stereotype (despite the easy setup for them to do so) and one of the most surprising friendships on TV this year."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,It’s Netflix’s version of the sort of retro TNT drama that I only know exists because I left my television on after an NBA game...
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"Some 10-episode shows seem stretched out, but “The Lincoln Lawyer” is fast-moving and packed with incident. Yet Mickey’s personal life is also well developed."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,“The Lincoln Lawyer” is a clear streaming win that could’ve easily played just as well on network television.
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Despite some admirable efforts by its committed cast, this version of The Lincoln Lawyer never makes a compelling case for its lengthy and laborious existence."
The Lincoln Lawyer,1,"To be honest, I didn’t know what to expect from The Lincoln Lawyer, but over 10 episodes, I’m extremely in need of seeing more of Mickey Haller."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Part reality competition and part train wreck, this is a formulaic series produced to make its cast look pathetic."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"In this instance, hate the show, not the contestants, and what we learn is that just when you think Netflix won’t go lower, it certainly will."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"If their newest reality series becomes a success, we should only expect more of this sort of bootlicking, conservative garbage in the future."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A contrived Netflix reality show as dumb as all the others.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
Dark,1,Dark's last season overcomplicates the time travel experience but in some weird way creates an emotional goodbye to this technically incredible show. [Full review in Spanish]
Dark,1,Is it too early to say that Dark is one of the best series of the century so far? I don't believe so. [Full review in Spanish]
Dark,1,"And while Dark's final season does not deliver on every single thread, it does provide an overall great culmination to the story."
Dark,1,"Dark is much more than a series about time travel. It is a modern tragedy supported by a narrative artifice that makes it dynamic and playful for the viewer. Thanks to his narrative mosaic, unexpected twists... [Full review in Spanish]"
Dark,1,"Watching Dark's third and final season is like clutching the hand of a person who's dangling from a helicopter over a vast canyon-you're just holding on for dear life, desperate to maintain your grip on the wild situation."
Dark,1,Dark Season 3 is the ultimate salute to the complexities and knots human emotions can create.
Dark,1,The thing about Dark is that you don't need to maintain a complex diagram of overlapping timelines and rootless family trees to maintain an interest in what's happening to the people of Winden.
Dark,1,"Dark is, simply put, a must-watch!"
Dark,1,The third season features a satisfying conclusion that could be considered one of the best we have seen from this genre.
Dark,1,"But, early in the third and final season, I wonder if the show is beginning to collapse under the weight of its own complexity."
Dark,1,"It turns out nothing that happened in Winden was accidental. It was all connected in a grand, precise scheme with a beginning and an end, consciously orchestrated by creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese."
Dark,1,"In its final episode Dark ties up its paradox-like threads with ease, ensuring its whole audience is left satisfied. Kudos to all those involved with bringing this mind-blowing concept to completion."
Dark,1,"For Netflix's German-language sci-fi series Dark, the show's final season is written in a way that feels organic, and the characters get the send-off they deserve."
Dark,1,"In its final outing, Dark's creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese have delivered an ending the show deserved - one that isn't perfect, but befitting."
Dark,1,"This monster of a show did not end how I expected it to, but I can't imagine wanting it to end any other way."
Dark,1,"The longer I chewed on it, the more I grew to appreciate the feat Dark pulled off with this last act."
Dark,1,Dark offers more of the same for better or worse and should leave fans satisfied. [Full Review in Spanish]
Dark,1,"One of the delights about this show is that with each revisit, there will always be something new to pick up, [Full Review in Spanish]"
Dark,1,A strong final cycle that affects your brain and heart. [Full Review in Spanish]
Dark,1,"The headache inducing series has come to an end, with a confusing and lukewarm finale. But somehow, it worked. [Full review in Spanish]."
Dark,1,"One of the most mind-melting shows on television, and possibly the most unique Netflix original, Dark finishes its run with peak writing, shocking conclusions, and a bittersweet sense of finality."
Dark,1,"A series that will be sorely missed by fans, Dark bows out on a high with its third season."
Dark,1,"What makes the series effective is not its complexity. Rather, it recognizes our need for patterns and making sense of things despite the overwhelming flow of information."
Dark,1,"For a show with this many plates to spin, it's a wonder that Dark closes out on a final note that both honors the head-turning complexity of the show's plot and lands some much-needed emotional and thematic notes."
Dark,1,"This is groundbreaking television at its best. The viewing experience is a fully immersive one, pulling you under and keeping you there until the very last scene."
Dark,1,"Dark's third and final season on Netflix is a memorable journey through time and space, with thrilling character shifts and fascinating paradoxes to unpack."
Dark,1,It's here where a show that's always delighted in complexity finally explodes.
Dark,1,"""Dark"" has maintained that highwire act for three of the most thrilling sci-fi TV seasons ever made. To see it make it across the chasm with its ambitions and technique intact is certainly something worth remembering."
Dark,0,"For a series that thrives in its complexity, it's disappointing."
Dark,1,Its success on that front can partly be attributed to the fact that the series is a relatively rare recent example of something which seems to have been conceived as a trilogy right from the outset.
Dark,1,"Dark season 3 is beautiful and tenebrous in every sense of the word, and it's difficult to imagine how any other series could match this complex yet complete achievement."
Dark,1,Creators Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar provide a brilliant endgame that is as deeply satisfying and emotionally resonant as any fan could possibly hope for.
Dark,1,"These eight episodes are a fantastic conclusion for Dark, and co-creators Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar have successfully and at times brilliantly closed their storytelling loop in dramatic, emotional fashion."
Ozark,1,"Powered by solid performances by the ever-reliable Jason Bateman, the wonderful Laura Linney, and a spectacular Julia Garner, the season unveils all the answers..."
Ozark,1,Dear Ozark:  Atlanta and Georgia will miss you . . . though I will always hate-hate-hate that final episode.
Ozark,1,"The grayish hues set the tone for these condemned, cursed beings making transcendental decisions for themselves and their own. [Full review in Spanish]"
Ozark,1,The murder and mayhem that have characterized Jason Bateman & Laura Linney's crime drama has come to an enthralling end - with a shocking twist - so it's the perfect time to binge-watch all four seasons.
Ozark,1,"…an adult, intense show that aims for a societal fault line where crime and community intersect violently on Main Street…"
Ozark,1,"Ozark might have started out as a Breaking Bad imitator, but it ended as an American Horror Story."
Ozark,0,"The tension all goes slack, formerly compelling characters end up being waved at each other like wooden dolls, and yet another prestige drama leaves the audience wondering why they bothered."
Ozark,0,"Yes, I watched the second half of the Netflix hit series’ final season, and no, it wasn’t good. And I say this as someone who used to like the show."
Ozark,1,"Compared to Part 1 of this fourth and final season, this last batch of seven episodes is sleek, direct, and action-packed."
Ozark,1,"A chilly, thrilling narco saga told from the perspective of the Mob’s money launderer, Ozark deserves its place among the very finest TV takes on American dope, crime and corruption."
Ozark,1,These seven episodes are more about saying goodbye than good riddance–a staggering tonal shift for a show so dark it once threatened to drown a baby.
Ozark,1,Julia Garner has already won two Emmys for her work in Ozark and could easily pick up another for her work in the final season. She makes Ruth a ticking bomb ready to explode.
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
Ozark,1,"Ozark, however, never loses sight of the fact that selling your soul is rarely done solely for righteous reasons."
Ozark,1,"I wanted to see who lived, who died and how their stories ended, regardless of all the reasons I had to dismiss what was going on."
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
Ozark,1,"Think you know whats going to happen? Yeah, so did I."
Ozark,1,"It's a season that takes us slowly to the end, and doesn't go out with a bang so much as a controlled burn. That's all very Ozark, but, after the breathtaking twists and turns of part 1, it all feels anticlimactic."
Ozark,1,"The result is an ending that’s unbearably tense, obliquely poignant, and some of the best event TV we’ve seen on any streaming service."
Ozark,1,The Crime Saga Crashes Into Its Inevitable Conclusion.
Ozark,1,"It is just as engrossing, intense, and jaw-dropping as you would hope and expect."
Ozark,0,"More often than not, Ozarks double-crosses and shady dealings read like bullet points on a list the writers are running through, with no intrigue or connective tissue between them."
Ozark,1,"If weve learned anything from Ozark is that no reward comes without startling losses, unpredictable twists, and the sinking feeling that peace of mind is an unachievable high."
Ozark,1,"The new season manages to keep the pressure on, with a palpable sense that things are coming to a head...Part one offers real hope that the creators are set to stick the landing."
Ozark,1,"""Ozark"" is presenting half of its last season and it is a doozy. Wendy/Linney is still playing ""Lady Macbeth"" while Marty/Bateman is still trying to get back to the future."
Ozark,1,The final two episodes are surely going to go down on best-of lists by the end of this year with the seventh serving as an absolute gut-punch for fans of the series.
Ozark,1,"The first part of the Netflix series' final season repeats some familiar notes, but also hints at an explosive ending."
Ozark,1,"The acting throughout makes the sometimes ludicrous believable, and we're getting little shafts of insight into contemporary American problems. The tension and the fascination don't ever let up."
Ozark,1,"As longtime fans know, a viewer is required to suspend a lot of his or her disbelief to enjoy Ozark to its fullest. That won't change now, as swallowing even that the Byrdes are still alive at this point will take some effort on your part."
Ozark,1,"It can be seen as death of the American dream stuff. Mostly, it's just terrific drama. But yes, if you are looking for it, there is plenty said about the state the US is in."
Ozark,1,"Watching ""Ozark"" with the mindset of watching a soap opera opens the whole thing up. Oh the joy."
Ozark,1,"It's Garner's character, Ruth, who reminds us why we are still watching this."
Ozark,0,Better Call Saul is a chess game; Ozark is a shell game that quickly rearranges characters and alliances for no real reason other than to keep the story moving.
Ozark,1,"Ozark's finale is full of twists and turns, and continues to intrigue, it will leave you wanting more."
Ozark,1,The final episodes of Netflix’s “Ozark” almost confirm that some Peak TV can come close to achieving what was once called “the great American novel.”
Ozark,1,"The users and the people being used. The bleak binary has played out since 2017, but what makes Ozark consistently fascinating is learning how just about everybody occupies both roles at the same time."
Ozark,1,"When Navarro and Javi embrace to say ""Blood over everything,"" they mean that blood is thicker than water, but it foreshadows that there will be blood. There is no ""Red Wedding,"" but several characters won't make it out alive."
Ozark,0,"When each scene is over, it evaporates in the perpetual churn of increasingly insupportable plot points."
Ozark,1,The Byrdes' risky adventures in money laundering continue to captivate as the Netflix show nears its end.
Ozark,1,"There is, in fact, no end of trouble and danger. This time, however, there is a more coherent storyline."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
Ozark,1,"Increasing the kids' role without losing any of its potency, this Netflix drama remains among TV's best, unfolding with a perpetual state of dread."
Ozark,1,"Look, it grips me. I'll watch it all. All the ingredients of a hit are there. But it's still not quite enough."
Ozark,1,[Garner's] performance will go down in history as one of the finest ever seen on television or streaming services.
Ozark,1,"Laura Linney's performance as Wendy is all the more chilling because her face says apple pie, but everything she does curdles into evil."
Ozark,1,"With the atmosphere increasingly tense and pastries and ultimatums delivered with a flourish, Ozark fans can expect to find themselves losing the next few days to this addictive story."
Ozark,1,Ozark is en route to finishing an exemplary series excellently.
Ozark,1,"It all adds up to an overwhelming sense of stasis -- despite this fourth and final season bringing what ought to be a refreshing supply of new characters and cleverly written new developments... That said, Ozark remains a show of many strengths"
Ozark,1,"Ozark continues to take its audience on a suspenseful ride, delivering its most thrilling season yet."
Ozark,1,"Ozark is still going strong even as it nears the end, thanks to a stellar cast and sharp writing. Marty, Wendy & Ruth are some of the greatest TV characters of all time."
Ozark,1,The fourth season of Ozark confirms the growth that the series showed in the final stretch of the third and is paving the way for what promises to be an exciting finale. [Full review in Spanish]
Ozark,1,"A season on family, morality, dysfunction, and vengeance leaves us in the wake of an all-time best performance from Julia Garner and a jaw-dropping story. Ultimately, no one is safe inOzark."
Ozark,1,"The stakes are higher than ever, the Byrde family continues to get themselves in deeper, and the action picks up in the final few episodes. Linney and Garner, once again, steal the show."
Ozark,1,"If it all sounds kind of ridiculous it's because it is. But it's also massively entertaining, largely because of the performances."
Ozark,1,Ozark's long farewell is certainly off to a gripping start.
Ozark,0,All of this generates incident. But little has the heat of real drama.
Ozark,1,"It's all very tense, but the shocking plot turns deliver diminishing returns."
Ozark,1,"Be it the thrills, the performances, or morbid curiosity, Mundy's series is still searching for more meaning in its final hours."
Ozark,1,Ozark returns toprove its worth in the genre by remaining a riveting and satisfying crime drama to its bitter (almost) end.
Ozark,1,"While season four part one naturally is merely laying the foundation for Ozark's end game, there are already plenty of twists and major developments setting up a finale bound to be a fist-in-mouth ride right until the very end."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Arcane manages not only to transcend the video game adaptation curse, but with it's bold visual style, endlessly complex characters, engaging story and unique world, this show has easily become required viewing for any fantasy or TV fan."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,I'll probably never spend a minute of my life playing League of Legends. I'll spend many minutes and hours watching Arcane.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,It was brilliant and twisted and dark and fun and I loved it.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Mature and well-plotted storytelling, interesting and multi-layered characters and stunning animation meant that even though I had no interest in LoL I had a great time."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"There's a lot that works in Arcane: animation, characters, world-building, style."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,What really elevates the show's solid storytelling is its transcendent animation. Characters' faces register every flicker of emotion.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"An excellent TV show, which is a wonderful thing to be."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"""Arcane"" achieves a feat for CGI animation in a made-for-streaming series."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"A classic in the making, and the nail in the coffin of the so-called ""video game curse."""
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"""Newcomers should be equally enthralled by Arcane's compelling narrative, richly developed characters and detailed world-building, all realised through a visually dazzling blend of hand-drawn and computer-generated animation."""
Arcane: League of Legends,1,A visually stunning animated effort that easily stands toe-to-toe with the medium's most vaunted entries.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,A visual delight... The result is nothing short of miraculous. [Full review in Spanish]
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Arcane act one introduces an epic, mega, awesome world of so many layers where politics, sisterhood and magic collide!"
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"with the Netflix Original anime Arcane, the world of League of Legends is open to new audiences in a way that explores the depth and lore of the game like we've never seen before."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Most series wish they could start off this strong. A totally immersive and engaging story, Arcane is a force to be reckoned with."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"I was shockingly invested in the story after the first three episodes, in a way that almost snuck up on me."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Arcane features some of the most brilliant animation we have seen on Netflix, as the stage is now set for something epic to come."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Stunning. The next evolution in animation, after Into the SpiderVerse and Batman The Animated Series. Arcane also builds on the work of Don Bluth, with a ""Dark Disney"" vibe."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,I've largely come away surprised by how much I'm enjoying it.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Even if you're not a gamer, or a fan of League of Legends, Arcane will be more than entertaining enough to hold your interest, with an interesting story backed by amazing animation."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Even if you have no interest in picking up any kind of gaming console, do yourself a favor and give Arcane a try."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,Finds plenty of room to add to the world players already know and welcome new fans at the same time.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,There isn't anything about Arcane that I would call new or revolutionary. It's a fairly typical fantasy tale that just happens to be really well done.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,Nothing I have seen or read about League of Legends prepared me for the level of artistry and narrative poured into Arcane.
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"A visually stunning series with an extremely captivating story. Fans of the League of Legends video game will love it, but so will those new to the franchise."
Arcane: League of Legends,1,"Arcane is a riveting animated series from Riot Games and Netflix, and it's another win for video game adaptations."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"In all,  Love, Death & Robots proves why it deserves every one of its animation Emmy wins as it advances the industry while blowing our little minds. And this time around, there are more terrifically twisted tales to match an array of techniques."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Love, Death and Robots continues to delight, entertain and engage."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"That thing about third times being the charm is true, for Volume 3 of Love, Death & Robots is the best of them all."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Love, Death + Robots return to Netflix for a third volume of short stories just as wild, epic, and oftentimes unnerving as previous seasons."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,Sci-fi pills full of surprising endings... [Full review in Spanish]
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Season three is a series of dreams that unfolds with a kind of absolute possibility. I’m never tired of the soft interlude between one episode and the next, when the potential for the following imaginative leap is gently waiting behind the credits."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Love, Death and Robots’ third season continues to be as enjoyable as its previous seasons, but much like Season 2, could have done with more episodes."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"While there are some impressive examples of CG animation, the craftsmanship is mostly stronger than the stories featured."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Continues to push the boundaries of animated anthologies, with a collection of studios delivering some twisted sci-fi and horror tales."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Full of rich imagination, smart details, and a refreshing lack of restraint, in both its visuals and language."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Keeping the individual shorts shorter and snappier. There are more guts and gore than in season 2, though without the excessive sexual violence from season 1. We love to see it!"
"Love, Death + Robots",1,Arguably the strongest collection yet: nine genre shorts without a weak link among them.
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"While this collection of nine episodes is likely the weakest of the bunch to date, there’s still much to marvel at both in terms of its provocative storytelling and especially the diverse, alluring animation on offer throughout."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"Here’s hoping we have more Love, Death + Robots to look forward to in the future. This is one of the best things Netflix has ever allowed to happen."
"Love, Death + Robots",1,But the real advantage isn’t much of a secret – the show’s just made by talented people who have been given enough creative freedom to tell the stories they want to.
"Love, Death + Robots",1,"If this turns out to be the end of Love, Death + Robots then it’s done a sterling job at telling some deeply strange, unconventional, and aesthetically gorgeous stories, but hopefully there’s still more of this high-minded mechanical madness on the way."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The coincidences in the plot are too good to be true,  but the acting of all involved raises the level of enjoyment."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The only thing shocking about Anatomy of a Scandal is that David E. Kelley, creator of series like Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and The Lawyer, hasn't had a hit since the first season of Big Little Lies. [Full review in Spanish]"
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"It’s not the hard-hitting takedown of power and privilege it hopes to be, but the cast and pacing make Anatomy of a Scandal a binge-able, if messy, affair."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Provocative, suspenseful courtroom dramaerotic thriller, pivoting around the controversial concept of 'consent.'"
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The strength of Anatomy of a Scandal lies in its cast, who deliver scene-stealing performances, especially Sienna Miller and Naomi Scott. Its weak spot is its story, which isn't as nuanced as it could be."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Give me Hugh Laurie doing Agatha Christie, any day, over hysterical tosh like Anatomy of a Scandal."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"With legal TV impresario David E. Kelley at the helm adapting a novel with a grabby MeToo-inspired premise, this drama should be spectacular, but it doesn't quite hit those heights."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"In Anatomy of a Scandal, there is the matter of what constitutes consent and what is rape. But the muddled storytelling leaves the victim behind."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Protecting the family name is a luxurious burden of being British -- every season of The Crown reinforces this -- and that, I think, is why we can’t turn away from Anatomy of a Scandal. It’s simply too delicious when Brits go gonzo."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"This is serious subject matter, but it’s hard not to laugh at some bizarrely surreal flourishes, the howlingly bad dialogue and the preposterously prim accents."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The dull courtroom sequences occasionally slip into stagey reconstructions of what happened between defendant and accused. At no point does Kelley’s series pause to consider what it is it’s trying to say about, um, well, anything."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,Another standardized Kelley production where everyone is guilty of something and enough twists to keep watching to the unrealistic outcome.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"For all its flaws, Anatomy of a Scandal is a more-ish show that at least has a curiosity about the equally flawed world in which we live."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"While not as focused as it needs to be, this courtroom drama manages to maintain tension and keep viewers interested. It is occasionally difficult to watch, but the performances are great."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,Anatomy of a Scandal should be applauded for taking something so tricky... and for letting the audience sit in the greyest of moral areas for quite some time.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,A glossy yet gritty thriller.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"I needed a constant supply of Red Bulls to make it through to the end. It’s the sort of series you want to thrash with a broom, hoping it will leap into some kind of life."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Is this an erotic thriller? A courtroom drama? An expose of social issues? At times it is all of these things, though most of the time it exists in the listless space between any clear genre -- or sense of identity."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"There is, the wandering plot notwithstanding, plenty of reason to relish the antic tone, the way the aimless banter and the flashes of wit manage to instill life into otherwise feeble exchanges."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,Anatomy of a Scandal overcomes its flaws well enough to lay the groundwork for what's intended to become an ongoing franchise of tightly constructed self-contained thrillers.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The courtroom scenes are quite captivating and we, the audience, get to be the jury hearing the voices and opinions and interpreting them accordingly."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"A crafty mixture of classiness and crowd-pleasing pot-boilerishness, referencing major issues and slickly filleting them into commercial catnip."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"It’s not as good as Big Little Lies by a long shot, but it does scratch the same itch."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"It’s well written, witty, terse, precise, and moves at a nice pace once it gets going and the bombs go off."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Anatomy of a Scandal is compelling, even in its shortcomings."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The suspense builds from episode to episode as these three complicated, well-drawn characters knock against each other – in court, in private and in memory."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Kudos to the three principal stars — Friend, Miller and Dockery — who hold the story together despite its absurdist twist and help the series retain its strangely gripping, binge-worthy status as it chugs toward its conclusion."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Performance is key in “Scandal,” and there isn’t a bad one to be found."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s garbage, but it’s high-end garbage and eminently binge-able. That kind of thing has its place."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Anatomy of a Scandal struggles to thread the needle between [its] two impulses, resulting in a show that’s unsatisfying as either a lurid thriller or a serious drama."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"A paint-by-numbers thriller that ostensibly investigates the nature of sexual consent without really making us feel invested in any of the characters involved, however well-acted."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,There are several bizarre gaps in the shows structure.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"The result is a series with a slow burn that reaches electrifying moments and, ultimately, offers satisfying closure."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"There is, without a doubt, much more left to say on the topic—which is why it’s such a shame to see Kelley keep repeating himself."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"There are handfuls of well-observed moments that go some way in making up for these jarring ones. Every time that her young son repeats the phrase “Whitehouses always win!” to garner approval from his dad, you can see a part of Sophie dying inside."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,Anatomy of a Scandal most resembles a soap opera you’d watch in order to have something on in the background. But the ultra-serious subject matter make it an impossible mindless watch.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Like any paperback novel you’d pick up at an airport newsstand, Netflix’s Anatomy of a Scandal isn’t for all time, but it does make for a good time."
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Anatomy of a Scandal stars Sienna Miller as Sophie Whitehouse. Shes married to the square-jawed and perfectly coiffed James Whitehouse (Rupert Friend), a Tory UK minister. Theyre the epitome of conservative picture-perfection."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Out of all the thriller fare that Kelley has adapted for the small screen to date, the whole of Anatomy of a Scandal is disappointingly much less compelling than the sum of its parts."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,Anatomy of a Scandal still packs a punch as it reveals the inner lives of everyone involved in this high-profile scandal.
Anatomy of a Scandal,1,"Incisive, enraging and boasting an excellent ensemble, this timely drama may be made for binge-viewing but it offers plenty of food for thought."
Intimacy,1,"This well-written series, which is told with the help of flashbacks, keeps viewers in suspense thanks to a complicated investigation that take takes audiences to unexpected places."
Intimacy,1,"The series is at its best when it shows the historically ingrained ways in which society blames a victim, and how [the prejudices] extend to businessmen, government employees and even family, instilling fear, shame and blame. [Full review in Spanish]"
Intimacy,1,Sketches with broad strokes a long list of topics. There are manuals of values and morals with much less content. [Full review in Spanish]
Intimacy,1,"The series aims to balance the increasing tension of a thriller as the viral video makes its way up the political power chain, with the more dramatic consequences each of these women face as the world judges them. [Full review in Spanish]"
Intimacy,1,It goes above and beyond the mere entertainment the mystery element provides. [Full review in Spanish]
Intimacy,0,"Heavy-handed, and some of the dialogue seems like a first draft they never polished. [Full review in Spanish]"
Intimacy,1,"Intimacy makes a strong case that the status quo of how a victim of a privacy breach should just slink away in humiliation is not only old fashioned, but dangerous."
Intimacy,1,Intimacy serves the subject matter well. It represents the cruel nature of cybercrime and how it can upend a person’s life.
First Kill,1,"With vibes of Romeo and Juliet meets Disney’s Zombies meets Killing Eve, First Kill is a bit campy and doesn’t take itself too seriously."
First Kill,1,"Overwrought, chaotic messiness is exactly what I want and expect from such an unabashedly sapphic teen drama."
First Kill,1,"This modern, diverse approach to the teen vampire romance genre is refreshing yet meandering."
First Kill,0,"The story is one you’ve definitely heard before, the leads lack chemistry, and the whole thing is lit like a deodorant commercial."
First Kill,1,First Kill makes its stance as a vampire coming-of-age story that acknowledges its similarities to Romeo and Juliet.
First Kill,1,"Netflix's ""First Kill"" spins its teenage lesbian love story into an engagingly batty, B-movie-style horror show."
First Kill,1,"It definitely does not stand on the same level as Shakespeare’s love story, but it does something for those who continue to look for women-loving-women representation in the media."
First Kill,0,It's Buffy meets Riverdale in the worst/best way possible.
First Kill,1,It’s for the teen gays who don’t have to be on edge while watching girls kiss on the TV in the family room because they are fully out and no one cares.
First Kill,1,"First Kill breathes new life into the lesbian vampire genre, while shattering old tropes in the process."
First Kill,0,First Kill could have been a fun teen supernatural series. But its storytelling is so clumsy it’s just very hard to watch.
First Kill,1,"[First Kill] pulls together all the moody YA vampire trash we have loved deeply and distills it into a queer star-crossed romance that is enjoyable to watch, even if it doesn’t always make sense."
First Kill,0,"It's not a good show, but it does have a good message: Love is love. Netflix is releasing this during Pride Month for a reason."
First Kill,0,"First Kill is a soapy supernatural star-crossed romance that doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, or elevate itself above the other mediocre series of its ilk."
First Kill,0,"The one-line description -- Romeo and Juliet, only adapted here as the crucifix-crossed romance between a vampire and a vampire slayer -- seems ripe for mockery, and the execution doesn't do much to blunt it."
First Kill,0,"For all the work First Kill puts into making sure it hits all the right notes, the series feels more like an uncanny valley version of what it’s attempting to be rather than a worthwhile story all its own."
First Kill,1,"Though this show might not be for everyone, it’s definitely for all the queer girls who were Team Bella during their Twilight phase, or anyone who just wants to see a new take on a tired genre."
First Kill,0,"A dull, predictable Buffy the Vampire Slayer knock-off."
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
First Kill,1,"First Kill has something few other vampire shows have right now: a super hot, super sweet same-sex romance at its center."
First Kill,0,"First Kill features excellent chemistry between the two leads, and interesting lore, but the dialogue isn’t doing this story any favors. Even though there is potential, season one takes too long to find its footing."
First Kill,1,"First Kill has a lot of issues, but fans of YA paranormal romance are going to eat it up."
First Kill,1,"Fans of a certain age will, fittingly, eat this right up, especially the saucier bits and some aspects of the wider worldbuilding that imply all kinds of interesting themes and ideas that these eight episodes don’t have time to explore."
First Kill,1,"It’s a pleasant distraction that goes down easy enough — but it comes nowhere near capturing the all-encompassing allure of a really irresistible binge, let alone of a forbidden first love."
First Kill,1,"If you surrender to its delicious cheesiness, you’ll have a lot of fun."
Pieces of Her,1,"On the face of it, it seems as though Collette as Laura is under-acting, portraying her character poorly, with not enough emotion. But really the opposite is true."
Pieces of Her,1,"I’ve read and enjoyed a couple of Slaughter’s books. If you have, you’ll know there’s, well, much muchness about them in their pile-on of twists and revelations. Pieces is a good representative..."
Pieces of Her,1,Pieces of Her isnt perfectit feels at once overstuffed and truncatedbut its undeniably compelling television thanks to its strong cast and endless cache of surprises.
Pieces of Her,0,"Despite a gripping and finely acted opening act, this series fails to deliver on the type of artful suspense and nuance it hints at early on."
Pieces of Her,0,"A tedious, tiresome mess that almost put me to sleep."
Pieces of Her,0,"Collete is as watchable as always; she deserves better than this, though."
Pieces of Her,1,Karin Slaughter's suspense novel provides the twisting plot that will hold viewers rapt.
Pieces of Her,0,"In order to stretch out the drama...it can drag a little bit rather than make it interesting to
watch... By the time you figure out what's going on, which is four or five episodes in, it loses steam."
Pieces of Her,1,An immediately intriguing piece of work built on acts of political and family terror committed decades before the present day. Collette and Heathcote are both terrific in roles that contrast in some ways but echo each other in others.
Pieces of Her,1,"Toni Collette is central to both and is absolutely superb. Bella Heathcote is equally involved, and though her character has much less complex material to work with, she’s terrific too."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
Pieces of Her,0,"Collette is captivating as usual, but the same cant be said for the story. Featuring more than a few exposition-filled moments and strange decisions, it never fully comes together."
Pieces of Her,1,"The series coasts on several genuinely shocking and well-executed twists, which do indeed puncture the haze of passive-watching we’re so used to. And maybe that adrenaline hit is enough."
Pieces of Her,0,"Pieces of Her takes a similar premise, stretches it across eight hours, largely avoids the wrenching character drama of a child learning her mother is an entirely different person, and makes it all… nice. Very nice. Too nice."
Pieces of Her,1,"Pieces of Her is a thriller with an outstanding, can’t-take-your-eyes-away performance in the main role."
Pieces of Her,0,Pieces Of Her takes forever to come together.
Pieces of Her,0,Not exactly a page turner.
Pieces of Her,1,"Collette and Heathcote play off each other well, and Hardwick brings a soothing presence to the high-tension mother-son pairing."
Pieces of Her,0,"If, like me, you want something deeper, you’ll find Pieces of Her’s biggest mystery will be how this tonally mismatched, structurally messy show came to be."
Pieces of Her,1,"[A] relatively modest (in this case, eight-episode) commitment. Pieces of Her proves reasonably compelling on that level and those terms, but as such series go, still feels as if it adds up to less than the sum of its parts."
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Pieces of Her,1,What makes “Pieces of Her” something better than just a diverting entertainment are the central performances and the mother-daughter story that exists both within and without the thriller.
Pieces of Her,1,Toni Collette masterfully anchors the new Netflix mystery-thriller series as a seemingly mundane woman whose dark past threatens to upend the life of her and her daughter.
Pieces of Her,1,Why isn’t Collette in everything? Or at least a lot more than she is in?
Pieces of Her,0,"Slick enough to keep a viewer from turning off Netflix’s autoplay feature, but too broad and detached to generate much in the way of insight or emotional connection, Pieces of Her struggles to locate a beating human heart at the center of its mystery."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette never misses, but shes left stranded here by a script that doesnt go far enough to provoke B-movie thrills and is structured in a way that drains anything that feels realistic."
Pieces of Her,1,Toni Collette gives a satisfying performance as a woman who wants her past to remain just thata past.
Pieces of Her,1,Netflix's Pieces of Her delivers a very watchable by-the-numbers thriller that's strengthened by leading ladies Toni Collette and Bella Heathcote's dynamic chemistry.
Pieces of Her,0,"While a new Collette performance is an event, the show often seems to be hiding its most effective onscreen asset, in favor of time spent in the past. And that past likely worked better on the page than onscreen."
Pieces of Her,0,"The bad news is that most of the other elements are merely fine, such that there’s no great takeaway for viewers beyond “wow, Toni Collette!” and even that, repeated ad nauseam, becomes a kind of quiet damnation of everything else."
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
Pieces of Her,1,"Intense at times, but slow at others. The ending just kind of happens, but the ride is worth the anticlimactic final ten minutes."
Pieces of Her,0,It just could have been so much better.
Pieces of Her,1,"As all the parts fuse, “Pieces of Her” delivers a gripping murder mystery, fully realized for television, that leaves audiences guessing until the very last scenes."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game is effective at pulling you in. By the middle of the first episode, viewers are plunged into a world that’s as repulsive as it is gripping, complete with masked villains and hapless antiheroes ..."
Squid Game,1,Hypnotic. [Full review in Spanish]
Squid Game,1,A dark and funny look at the well-known injustices of modern societies. [Full review in Spanish]
Squid Game,1,"""Squid Game"" is deservedly one of the hottest shows of the year, and it highlights the good streaming can do in regards to breaking down cultural barriers and exposing viewers to masterworks from across the world they would otherwise not have access to."
Squid Game,1,"""Squid Game'' is a well-produced thriller with a couple of decent twists and a whole lot of violence."
Squid Game,1,"Its messages hit like a sledgehammer to the head, yet this vibrant, vicious series holds a surprisingly big heart at its core. A winning blend of spectacle and sentiment."
Squid Game,1,"There is a visceral, primal, can't-look-away feeling to the nine-episode series, which traffics in gore but also deep psychological horror and disturbances."
Squid Game,1,"This is a series that needs to be experienced, not discussed or analysed. It is one that will stay on in your mind long after you've watched it."
Squid Game,1,It's not the kind of apocalypse story that longs for hopeful human resilience; it's most eloquent on the topics of financial despondence and weaponized nostalgia.
Squid Game,1,"Compulsively watchable although, in the end, his dark dystopian story is lightened by transforming his protagonist into yet another hero. Forget it, Jake. It's Netflix."
Squid Game,1,"All of it works as an exercise not just in survival of the fittest, but also as a stirring study of the whims of fortune, imbued with all that social commentary."
Squid Game,1,"In the end, the devastation left by the game is tangible, leaving the winner in anguish and despair, while those at home are begging for more."
Squid Game,1,A masterful show that truly changed the game in storytelling.
Squid Game,1,"I'm almost halfway through its nine-episode run, and you know what? It is just about worthy of the hype."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game doesn't delve too deeply - and it's not subtle - but for a visual hammer-blow, this has made waves."
Squid Game,1,Macabre and addictive. [Full Review in Spanish]
Squid Game,1,"It's weird, but becomes increasingly hypnotising as the story progresses. And inevitably, there are plenty of loose ends left over to set up series 2."
Squid Game,1,"The Squid Game is a wonderfully crafted suspenseful show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. But as the episodes move forward, the over dramatic elements take center stage and the whole thing loses steam scene after scene."
Squid Game,1,"The originality of the idea, the visual effects and of course, the acting are outstanding and incomparable to anything we have ever seen on television in our lives!"
Squid Game,1,Netflix's breakout series depicts a world of violent and macabre individualism and desperation.
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game is many things, but above all it's top-notch junk TV, to be binged with swivel-eyed abandon."
Squid Game,1,"I don't know if anything is ""111 million views instantly"" good but at least Squid Game delivered on the hype, it's if nothing else a great TV series."
Squid Game,1,"This very bingeable Korean horror drama may not be a feel good watch, but it sure does feel good to see how internationally popular it has become."
Squid Game,1,"Directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the South Korean import is a diabolical, original parable about money and debt."
Squid Game,1,"Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, who spent a decade trying to get the project green-lit and was once so desperate he sold his laptop for cash, will probably have less trouble getting his next script financed."
Squid Game,1,"The South Korean TV sensation taps into the universal apprehensions of pressing debt, strained family relations and the longing for a better life."
Squid Game,1,"For the most part, writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk's mix of high and low elements like that works incredibly well."
Squid Game,1,"It's an amazing piece of work, and I truly applaud creator Hwang Dong-Hyuk on making this mesmerizing, shocking and emotional show."
Squid Game,1,"Hwang has created one of the most immersive television worlds since Game of Thrones, with relentless entertainment value and remarkably fleshed-out, sympathetically flawed characters. It's a provocative morality play."
Squid Game,1,Totally bingeable.
Squid Game,1,"This is a show that plays to Netflix's strengths. Only Netflix are able to have a show that can generate such a buzz globally in literally a matter of days, even if the show is not in the English language."
Squid Game,0,"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn."
Squid Game,0,"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing."
Squid Game,1,Hwang Dong-hyuk has done a great job of bringing this ghoulishly entertaining series to life
Squid Game,1,"In the end, we have a great show about the core of humanity that should be making... Hollywood sweat right about now."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game is a rousing, disturbing, candy-coated, brain matter-splattered experience steeped in societal ennui."
Squid Game,1,Squid Game has one of the best first episodes of television I've ever seen. It shows the results you can get by investing in programming from around the world.
Squid Game,1,Is there a battle more emblematic of this moment than that between individual rights and social responsibilities?
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game is smart, well-written, and has a talented cast that takes an often violent story and makes it emotionally resonate."
Squid Game,1,"It's just really great telly. It's tightly written, each episode packed with enough pace to make it truly binge worthy."
Squid Game,1,"As social commentary, it mostly works. As a show about brutal, larger-than-life games to the death, it also mostly works... But as far as final acts go, Squid Game stumbled pretty badly."
Squid Game,1,"What writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk has done principally involves serving old wine in a new bottle. Seen that way, ""Squid Game"" presents a visually arresting variation on themes seen plenty of times before, which include tapping into the class divide."
Squid Game,1,[It] never makes its action look glamorous. Its intensity comes from feeling that you've gone beyond the end point of a chain of absurdist logic and you really might not want to see what comes next.
Squid Game,1,It really is an excellent distillation of how predatory capitalism works.
Squid Game,1,"What you've got in Squid Game, for all its now-notorious darkness, is a brave, dark, ambitious tale, at times moving and at times terrifying. Its power is in its understanding that money is survival."
Squid Game,1,"Debt to a cruel system is inescapable and dehumanizing, the show constantly reminds us. But beneath the hyper-violence, it also suggests that our obligations to other people can be a source of meaning, compassion, and --just maybe -- salvation."
Squid Game,1,"Dark, twisted, and surprisingly emotional, Squid Game is a quick bloody yet visually stunning must watch."
Squid Game,0,Craptacular.
Squid Game,1,"It does say a lot about human nature, friendship, cruelty, and the way modern societies have abused its poorer citizens. [Full review in Spanish]"
Squid Game,0,"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time."
Squid Game,1,"A twisty, fast-paced, action-packed show whose episodes end in killer cliffhangers-in other words, the ultimate binge bait."
Squid Game,1,Netflix's Korean thriller is on track to be the most watched series in the streamer's history. It's also giving people nightmares.
Squid Game,1,"As far as sociopolitical statements go, you also couldn't engineer a better strike to the millennial and Gen Z nerves than a show where characters have to perform useless tasks in order to marginally improve their luck of the draw."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game lays out its strengths early. The cast are terrific, the action is inventive and brutal and the influences are worn shamelessly."
Squid Game,1,"This unflinching look at how desperation changes us makes Squid Game as moving as it is exciting. It searches for an answer to one terrifying question: When pushed, what are your limits? What would you do? Its chilling brutality has us hooked."
Squid Game,1,"Equal parts gut-wrenching and squirm-inducing, it's a white-knuckle thriller, drama, and episodic psychological breakdown with a sickly pastel veneer. It's one of the most unique things you'll watch this year -- and maybe ever."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game culminates emotionally in episode six, centered on a childlike game of marbles that's paced with excruciating slowness as the main characters have to make, literally, life or death decisions with one another."
Squid Game,1,The human aspect of this show shines over the morbid. For some reason we are addicted to the unmeasured violence and the isolation and behavioral analysis of human beings in movies and TV shows. Recipe for success. [Full review in Spanish]
Squid Game,1,"Ignore some glaring red herrings, plot holes, occasional shoddy pacing and in-your-face gore, and Squid Game is worth bingeing."
Squid Game,1,"""Squid Game"" is fairly thoughtful, and the fact that there is no sexual component to the violence is something in its favor."
Squid Game,1,The ins and outs of the games are thrilling.
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game marks its own territory, first with its especially savage premise and the constant tension around life-or-death scenarios, and second, by focusing on each character's decisions, as they struggle to choose between survival and humanity."
Squid Game,1,"Stylish, gripping, and well-acted by an excellent ensemble cast, Squid Game will keep you pressing play, no matter how scared you get."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game is thrilling and original and full of gripping emotional twists-and despite being a big-budget Netflix show, it also feels subversive in our current media landscape."
Squid Game,1,"Truth be told, Squid Game is not for the faint of heart, but -- like some of the best genre content -- there's more going on between the kill or be killed."
Squid Game,1,Some predictable plot points distract from the fine acting and the high-minded concept. Fans of dystopian thrillers will enjoy this series. Sensitive or younger viewers should avoid this one.
Squid Game,1,"This series does not hold back. Squid Game is unabashedly violent, chaotic, and visceral."
Squid Game,1,Squid Games takes a fresh idea and spins it into a thrilling drama; we hope it continues to build the tension we saw in the last 20 minutes throughout the season.
Squid Game,1,"It's a strange, violent, disturbing adventure, and if that sounds like something you'd like, I can't recommend Squid Game enough."
Squid Game,1,"Squid Game doesn't offer an escape from the horrors of the real world; within its limitations as a fictional drama, it gives us something far rarer: an affirmation that they exist, and that we're not alone in finding them nightmarish."
Squid Game,1,"Overall, this is still a savagely entertaining slam dunk from Netflix Korea, which is likely to be embraced around the world as its predecessors were."
Squid Game,1,"Thematic intelligence aside, Squid Game is also a white-knuckle watch, thanks to its visceral competition element."
Squid Game,1,"Aside from being stretched just a touch too thin in spots, I'd say [Squid Game] deserves all the praise it's going to get."
Sex/Life,0,The eight-episode season easily could’ve been boiled down into two TikToks...
Sex/Life,0,"It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable."
Sex/Life,0,"That ""High Impact Sex Scenes"" content warning strikes me as blatant false adverting."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life is billed as comedy drama. If it's funny, though, it's for all the wrong reasons."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
Sex/Life,0,A Road Runner cartoon has more sophisticated characterisations.
Sex/Life,0,"Having watched all eight episodes of the show, what I remember from it isn't how steamy the sex scenes are (not least because they aren't), but how frustrating I found Billie and all of the people around her."
Sex/Life,0,This epitomizes trash TV; it's a soapy melodrama that could be interpreted either as emotional or hilarious depending on the viewer's interpretation.
Sex/Life,0,Dig a little deeper and you'll find a very naked truth: Sex/Life is nothing more than a series of dimly-lit sex scenes propped up by groan-inducing dialogue.
Sex/Life,1,"Amid all the hot and heavy, the performances are surprisingly good, as the characters navigate their messed-up love triangle, emotional baggage and lingering heartbreak. But there are times when you will get turned off by the choices they make."
Sex/Life,0,"There is a lot of sex and a lot of nudity in Sex/Life and while Netflix probably had hoped that Sarah Shahi's presence would elevate the series, the shoddy directing and the bad writing from Stacy Rukeyser mostly drags Shahi down with it."
Sex/Life,0,Sex/Life is about as sexy as running a UV wand through a cheap motel room that hasn't changed its mattress in seven years.
Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency."
Sex/Life,0,"Rather than interrogate why Billie's sublimated her needs for the sake of a relationship, the series seems concerned only with titillating viewers -- and, despite Shahi and Demos' athleticism and enthusiasm, even that gets old."
Sex/Life,0,"All of this would be laudable if the writing weren't hilariously atrocious. At least it's adhering to form, which means you can fast forward through most of it."
Sex/Life,1,"It's refreshing to watch a show where the female gaze is prioritized, and there's not a stigma around a woman craving sex and sexual attention from her partner."
Sex/Life,0,A show that has no idea what kind of message it wants to send.
Sex/Life,0,"Whatever inherent truths the show explores -- marriage is hard, the magic/romance fades, etc. -- get overshadowed by the wanton silliness."
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
Sex/Life,1,"Even as I was rolling my eyes at some of the insanely stupid actions of the lead characters and chuckling at the at-times overwrought score, I can't deny ""Sex/Life"" had a certain binge-worthy quality."
Sex/Life,0,"The primary failing of Sex/Life is its inability to balance the acrobatic-romp and woman-finding-herself elements of its concept; there's so much of the former, and not enough of the latter."
Sex/Life,1,An intensely steamy battlefield that will leave audiences feeling charged.
Sex/Life,1,"While not everyone will relate to the particulars of our heroine's conundrum, lots of us do have a toxic-but-hot ex who had an inexplicable hold on us, and we question whether or not we can be satisfied with someone who feels safe."
Hellbound,1,"The shows many thrilling scenarios present contemporary parallels with issues that bitterly divide us today, from social inequalities to Covid-19 vaccinations and global warming denialism."
Hellbound,1,Hellbound is a nasty piece of work that starts off fascinating and then blends its genre elements with its philosophical concepts into an unwieldy blend of thrills and heady ideas that land somewhat inertly by its conclusion.
Hellbound,1,Such good writing.
Hellbound,1,Hellbound gives its viewers no respite. [Full review in Spanish]
Hellbound,1,"Yes, something weird is happening in the world, but the real marvel here is how these beautifully realised characters try to wrap their heads around it."
Hellbound,1,"Terrific imagination, insight, characters and performances make for captivating viewing."
Hellbound,1,"Suddenly, South Korea is beginning to look like a powerhouse in the making, with consecutive big ratings hits with Squid Game and now Hellbound."
Hellbound,1,Will Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho's new streaming horror series be the next Squid Game?
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
Hellbound,1,"Between the sporadic and horrifying monster attacks, this series is a pretty compelling traditional detective story."
Hellbound,1,"Despite how slow and disjointed the first episode of Hellbound is, it sets up an interesting story that could go just about anywhere."
Hellbound,1,"Vibrant, haunting, horrifying and thought-provoking, and boasting plenty of twists and turns."
Hellbound,1,"Where it gets fascinating... is with how all of this presumably supernatural peculiarity is handled and sometimes exploited by all involved, from the cults cashing in to the police finding it just another bloody hassle."
Hellbound,1,"Hellbound may be endlessly bleak, but its mercilessly sharp focus on humanity's hypocrisy and evangelical panic reveals a highly gripping drama that holds no punches in exposing our true darkness."
Hellbound,1,It's in the sheer bleakness of the execution that makes Hellbound worth your time.
Hellbound,1,"""Hellbound"" is savvy in the way it treats this season with a bit of an anthology touch, avoiding the trap of following just one person as an audience surrogate."
Hellbound,1,"Hellbound uses its fantastical premise to create an intellectually exciting and genuinely disturbing religious horror show, even if some of the plotlines are a bit overly dramatic and cliche."
Hellbound,1,"At a time when many shows struggle to keep you engaged to the end of a pilot, piling on contrivances and reveals to force a sense of momentum, Yeon and Choi begin with a bang... and then immediately ground the drama."
Hellbound,1,"A fascinating entry into stories about faith, while not having a self-seriousness to its ideas. The wrath monster trio might be absurd, but the madness within Hellbound is extremely believable."
Hellbound,1,Hellbound finds a tricky moral tightrope underneath its phantasmagoria...
Hellbound,1,It's hard to keep your eyes away from Hellbound because the concept is so enticing and addictive.
Hellbound,1,"There can (and probably will) be more mystery to this story in future seasons, and I'll be devouring them with all the intensity of a supernatural smoke ape."
Hellbound,1,"Train To Busan's Yeon Sang-ho has crafted an eerie, twisty police procedural that uses supernatural ideas to explore far grander concepts around death and sin."
Hellbound,1,"All in all, Hellbound is an intriguing, albeit unfocused series with a solid hook."
Hellbound,1,"Hitting at various social themes in such a short amount of time is a difficult task, but Yeon Sang-ho gets the most out of his actors and the story to give us a captivating deconstruction of society."
Hellbound,1,Hellbound is a dark delight.
Hellbound,1,"Not only does it rock your socks off, it can get your brain working with the same amount of force."
Hellbound,1,The series showcases not only the strength of adapted content but the strength and diversity of K-drama as well.
Hellbound,1,"Hellbound unspools like a mix of Clive Barker, The Da Vinci Code and the iconic Japanese horror, Ring."
Hellbound,1,"This series proves to go much deeper than anticipated, as the philosophical questions become just as interesting as the horrific violence. While the balance may not be perfect, there is plenty that will have viewers locked in from start to finish."
Hellbound,1,"Hellbound's pacing might seem slow at first, but the narrative steadily evolves into a compelling mix of police procedural, violent horror and shrewd commentary around ideas of human flaws, mortality, sin, justice and the influence of media."
Hellbound,1,It's uniquely twisted how this series has contemplated miracles in 2021. The sorts of reactions that might fly up from the ashes are the juicy material I can't want to see spill out in coming episodes.
Midnight Mass,1,It connects us with Gothic tradition... redefines the vampire idea without mentioning the word once during the series. [Full review in Spanish]
Midnight Mass,1,Flanagan in [his] purest form. [Full review in Spanish]
Midnight Mass,0,"While some of the show's themes are talked to death, others wither away, undeveloped."
Midnight Mass,1,"While it may try your patience, it's still a good yarn."
Midnight Mass,1,"Though it certainly features too much speechifying, this is Flanagan's most thought-provoking material yet and a welcome addition to his expanding horror tome."
Midnight Mass,1,A memorably dark and gory and twisted saga...
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass goes further than tension or thrills, presenting a dense and somehow hopeful epic that leans into the existential terror of being alive."
Midnight Mass,0,"""Midnight Mass"" has something to say. It just can't help saying it too loudly-and without bothering to stop and spook us out."
Midnight Mass,1,"I found it consistently committed and admirably bonkers, even when it tested my patience."
Midnight Mass,1,Midnight Mass is a layered tale of retribution and rebirth.
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
Midnight Mass,1,"It's a must-watch for horror hounds, Halloween lovers, and people who just enjoy great storytelling."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's not that Flanagan 'transcends' the horror genre, it's that he fully inhabits it in the best tradition of the great authors. [Full review in Spanish]"
Midnight Mass,1,"Occasionally the monologues go on a little long, but the rich and complicated analysis of faith and religion, the stellar cast, the great direction and amazing creature design all make this one of Flanagan's best works to date"
Midnight Mass,1,"Not only is it a must-see this Halloween, it's the best thing the genre has produced in years. Holy Hell what a show."
Midnight Mass,0,"For me, Midnight Mass's conclusion feels less like a soothing balm in a moment of crisis, and more like an outright lie."
Midnight Mass,1,"The near slow motion demands patience, complicity, and involvement. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Midnight Mass,1,Hamish Linklater is fantastic as a priest. [Full review in Spanish]
Midnight Mass,1,No work has so passionately tapped into the [recent] anxieties of Christianity...Mike Flanagan's religious allegory is essential viewing for Christians in America.
Midnight Mass,1,"As a recovering Catholic, I certainly understand the underlying conflicts that this family is torturing itself through, & the island that is there to judge them. Ave Flanagan?"
Midnight Mass,1,"A real standout is Rahul Kohli, whose quiet turn as Sheriff Hassan speaks volumes (and could well be the launch to bigger things)."
Midnight Mass,0,"Had it been a 90-minute movie, Midnight Mass could pass as innocuous entertainment. But lasting seven hours, this is nothing more than an unfortunate waste of time. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Midnight Mass,0,"The series lacks a strong protagonist, and it is that all the time it distracts us with secondary characters to safeguard the mystery."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's substance abuse, more than vampirism, that occasions strong moral judgments, especially when others are harmed."
Midnight Mass,1,"Flanagan put his whole self on the line here, and I don't need to agree with every single choice to know that I'll be chewing over the entirety of this show for a very long time."
Midnight Mass,1,"I really appreciated Midnight Mass for delivering a product that balanced out the dark, cult-like aspect of faith, but also the things about it that can be beautiful."
Midnight Mass,1,"As an artistic representation of someone deconstructing their faith, Midnight Mass employs horror tropes to explore the ways religion responds to pain, both in ways that heal and ways that destroy."
Midnight Mass,1,"Though initially best watched without extensive knowledge of the plot, Midnight Mass offers deeper concepts worthy of follow up viewings."
Midnight Mass,1,"Even though Flanagan has hit multiple creative highs in his career already, Midnight Mass is undoubtedly his crowning achievement as a visual storyteller."
Midnight Mass,1,"There are moments where you can really see Flanagan taking it to the next level; a montage set to Neil Diamond's ""Holly Holy"" might be the best single thing he's done yet."
Midnight Mass,1,"At its best, Midnight Mass manages to make room for the scary and the sublime, the perverse and the personal and the profound."
Midnight Mass,1,"A masterfully directed, slow-burn tale that explores religion, fanaticism, trauma and grief, through some superb writing. Mike Flanagan's best work so far. [Full review in Spanish]"
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass is a seven-episode Netflix miniseries that explores religion and faith with Mike Flanagan's usual trademarks, prioritizing characters and emotions over cheap scares and shock value."
Midnight Mass,1,"Lurking at the dark heart of Mike Flanagan's latest is a Very Good Idea, one that I'm not sure has been done on screen before, and it's an absolute doozy."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass grips you tight with an enigmatic story, as Flanagan has once again created something so captivating and original."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass has a number of issues (especially with its long, winding monologues), but it is saved by its strong cast."
Midnight Mass,1,"With Midnight Mass, director Mike Flanagan further proves he is a master of emotional horror with a gory, heartwrenching tale about redemption, despite too many monologues that distract from the show's overall terror."
Midnight Mass,0,"Flanagan seems to have made a spiritual, contemplative turn in his life and writing. Good for him; not so good for those who liked his earliest stuff. I'm taking a pass on Mass."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass takes those elements we love from Mike Flanagan, and the soulful, heart-wrenching examination of the human experience, and turns it on its head."
Midnight Mass,0,"The major revelations present no real crisis, and they should."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass takes the time to establish its characters and setting before even getting to the freaky stuff, which allows it to deal with bigger themes like religion and redemption."
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Midnight Mass,1,"""Midnight Mass"" is so heartfelt. It burns with energy and life. And death. Death is the all-consuming factor here."
Midnight Mass,1,"The melodrama can get too much at times, and there's a lot of 'Midnight Mass' that gets way too heavy-handed after the third episode. Yet, by all accounts, 'Midnight Mass' is a darkly familiar fable of the hope and loss of faith in modern times."
Midnight Mass,1,'The Master' meets 'Storm of the Century.' This is easily the best series or film that Mike Flanagan and Trevor Macy have ever done.
Midnight Mass,1,-Mike Flanagan has written some powerful monologues delivered by his exceptional cast that will continue to sit with you. He takes on you on a wild ride narrowing in on the journey many of us have with our faith.
Midnight Mass,1,"The Netflix series deserves praise for its distinctive ambitions and jolting surprises but too often plays like a long-winded sermon, frittering around the edges of its homily."
Midnight Mass,1,"Ultimately, while the performances and the story on the character level are heartbreakingly superb, this angel's chaotic and creepifying introduction brings Midnight Mass down."
Midnight Mass,0,Flanagan's study of religion and immortality sometimes rekindles memories of actual midnight masses in that it can be a little exhausting in its preachiness with a few too many monologues.
Midnight Mass,1,"Relevant and controversial themes such as fanaticism, faith, despair, and economic hardship collide for powerful storytelling, although the journey is a bit sluggish at times."
Midnight Mass,1,"Flanagan's best work, whom seems to have used all of his previous projects as practice for this thrill machine, a series that broke my heart into a thousand pieces and left me thinking about his last moments long after it ended. [Full review in Spanish]"
Midnight Mass,1,"Flanagan is an actor's director, and he gets career-best performances out of Gilford, Siegel and Kohli."
Midnight Mass,1,"There will be screams, yes. There will be blood. But not before Midnight Mass has seduced its audience into caring about what happens."
Midnight Mass,1,Midnight Mass makes up for the somewhat predictable nature of its mystery with the thoughtful and varied ways the characters react to the changes overtaking Crockett Island.
Midnight Mass,1,"They won't be to everyone's tastes, granted, and the show isn't, at least on a superficial level, scary. But it finds terror in its contortion of Catholic staples such as Holy Communion, and of unwavering belief as an excuse for bigotry and fanaticism."
Midnight Mass,1,"More than just the sum of its scares, Midnight Mass is Flanagan's most thoughtful, carefully paced exploration of the horror genre's potential so far, and that's saying a lot."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass is astounding. This series perfectly balances religious themes, character depth, and traumatizing moments. It may be the best show of the year."
Midnight Mass,1,Flanagan has created a rich and menacing setting brimming with mystery and ideas...which begs to be explored further.
Midnight Mass,0,"The ensemble cast does some great work with the material given, and Linklater gives one of the best performances of his career. But it lacks the enveloping nature of Flanagan's previous horrors."
Midnight Mass,1,A confident tale of slow-building supernatural horror
Midnight Mass,1,"The journey is a gripping, bloodsoaked ride that makes for a Halloween watch that will be extremely difficult to top."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass is arguably Flanagan's greatest work to date, a mosaic of familiar themes elevated by an unbelievable harmony of performance and direction that sits easily among the best TV of 2021."
Midnight Mass,1,Makes fascinating connections between religious traditions and familiar demons while also respecting the value of religious belief.
Midnight Mass,1,"Mike Flanagan is known for inventive, effective storytelling, and Midnight Mass still exceeds expectations. The atmospheric horror is arresting, the production design is stunning and meticulous. It's truly a masterpiece."
Midnight Mass,1,[Flanagan] manages to have fun with the most macabre symbolism of Catholicism while asking pertinent questions around the confirmation bias of fanaticism and the banality of mob violence.
Midnight Mass,1,Linklater's Father Paul is the fervent glue that holds the series together.
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass ultimately sounds a warning against religious extremism but it also presents a spectrum of thoughts on faith, from a sensible argument for atheism to a rapturous description of the comforts of belief."
Midnight Mass,1,"So much of the show is quiet and thoughtful, which makes the dark moments hit really hard."
Midnight Mass,1,"Where its slow-paced execution feels draining, its acting is extraordinary."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's part religious thinkpiece, part pure horror as its finest. It's also a rare case where, while at times the one-hour episode runtime feels slightly too long, it ultimately pays off in a sensational way."
Midnight Mass,1,"Flanagan's shows are like islands in a storm-not always the cleanest or most elegant on the surface, but hearty, solid refuges nonetheless. And Midnight Mass is his best one yet."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's hard to knock Midnight Mass for taking too much time to think, especially when you consider the alternative."
Midnight Mass,1,"There's no doubt Flanagan has delivered his best series yet, as the blending of supernatural horror with startling religious undertones puts ""Midnight Mass"" in a class by itself. Rejoice! Your next obsession has arrived."
Midnight Mass,1,"Even in its weakest moments, Midnight Mass is a meticulously crafted exploration of religion, guilt, trauma, mortality, and what it means to truly have faith."
Midnight Mass,0,"Though it engages with potent ideas, the ultimate impact of Midnight Mass is softened by a lack of follow-through. It's a very talky show that struggles, in dialogue, to answer the questions it poses."
Midnight Mass,1,"A searing, complete work at the intersections of faith and doubt, life and death, it's genre storytelling at its most emotionally rich."
Midnight Mass,1,"More than being a scary story, this series is a haunting reflection of the excesses of religion as well as addiction and will leave you, like the denizens of this island, wanting more."
Midnight Mass,1,"At its best, Midnight Mass exudes a narcotic pull in everything from its aesthetics to monologues that suggest the weight of confession."
Midnight Mass,1,"Rahul Kohli maintains his status as the internet's most talented boyfriend as Crockett's new sheriff, so sturdy a presence it takes a few episodes to realize he's tamping down a hard-earned rage every second of the day."
Midnight Mass,1,"Mike Flanagan's Midnight Mass is his best work to date. It's filled with compelling characters and plenty of frights of both the supernatural and human varieties, but it's also a deeply personal story."
Midnight Mass,1,"It's genuinely, thrillingly, unique and certain scenes and moments will live with you long after you've finished watching."
Midnight Mass,1,Screams are a good thing in horror shows. It isn't particularly difficult to figure out what is going on on Crock Pot. But it is satisfying to see it play out and wonder how Flanagan will resolve everything.
Midnight Mass,1,"Linklater is absorbing as Father Hill, the enigmatic miracle-worker who announces himself as a surprise stand-in for the ancient and infirm town priest, last seen embarking on a Holy Land pilgrimage."
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass delivers creeping dread while exploring themes of faith, fanaticism and redemption. It's heady, highbrow horror that, though talky, grows more engrossing the longer you stick with it."
Midnight Mass,1,"In another, it's a measured, yet spooky take on group psychology, the need for faith in sorrow, and the ethics of leadership with such vulnerable followers, weighing whether these impulses represent human goodness, evil, or simply nothing at all."
Midnight Mass,1,Yet another winner from Mike Flanagan. A chilling examination of faith with knockout performances -- particularly Hamish Linklater and Samantha Sloyan.
Midnight Mass,1,"Midnight Mass is an intricate, gorgeously shot series with crafty dialogue, beguiling characters, and chills in time for the best season."
Midnight Mass,1,"Though Flanagan isn't interested in determining who is righteous and who is wicked, he has Midnight Mass ultimately arrive at a place of hope and light, using empathy and love as a guide through the darkness."
Midnight Mass,1,A culmination of everything Flanagan has gained and learned throughout his career. MIDNIGHT MASS is the filmmaker at his most vulnerable and most introspective.
Midnight Mass,1,This type of horror leaves a mark. It's as though Flanagan became such a quick study of what makes Stephen King's small-town horror tales resonate and is now primed to outpace the master.
Midnight Mass,1,"An intense, heart pounding, bone chilling story that perfectly weaves thriller and horror together while exploring human nature. The last scene -- stunning."
Midnight Mass,1,The weakest of the three Flanagan Netflix properties still hits the emotional punches you'd expect it to while featuring jaw-dropping performances from the entire cast.
Midnight Mass,1,"It's not always an easy watch, but it is a rewarding one. Be afraid, be heartbroken, and be (somehow) uplifted by Mike Flanagan's most profound work to date."
The Staircase,1,"Seriously, get this watched."
The Staircase,1,"Where Making A Murderer dragged, The Staircase darts. Where Making A Murderer has you applauding your guesswork, The Staircase has you damned."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase functions best as a documentary looking intently on the shortcomings of the American legal system, and how things can become so convoluted and messy that both victims and the accused will never find justice, closure, or peace."
The Staircase,1,"Most of us would like to think that, if we were in Michael Peterson's position, certain processes would be in place."
The Staircase,1,"By the end of its examination of the ways a trial can be skewed by investigators and faux ""expert"" witnesses, you will never want to break the law and face a so-called jury of your peers."
The Staircase,1,The sheer amount of archival footage in this show is absolutely nuts.
The Staircase,1,It makes for very powerful TV.
The Staircase,1,It's illuminating how flawed and nave the concept of blind justice is.
The Staircase,1,"This rotating cast of vampires and misfits not only makes for a thrillingly sloppy and mad case, it creates extraordinary telly, all whittled down from 16 years of footage."
The Staircase,1,"If The Staircase is a puzzle, it's one that still works no matter how you decide to arrange the pieces."
The Staircase,1,Unmissable stuff.
The Staircase,1,"It is a tragedy of epic proportions, sprawled out over 15 years. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. The case drags on. Yet Kathleen Peterson remains dead, reduced to a series of graphic images, to pieces of bloody evidence."
The Staircase,1,"Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""The Staircase""...is that you can watch all 13 episodes and ultimately still not be able to decide whether the protagonist, Michael Peterson, is guilty or innocent."
The Staircase,1,Groundbreaking true crime documentary is still compelling.
The Staircase,1,"At its core, there is an extraordinary study of the character of a man, Michael Peterson, a storyteller caught up in his own drama, playing along."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is less like other true crime documentaries and more like the Richard Linklater film Boyhood, although much sadder and involving real people."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase is like a true-crime version of the Up series, albeit on a much more modest scale. It is compelling, but like many entries in this genre, not exactly an objective work of journalism."
The Staircase,1,"The one-sidedness does mean you never get any sense of Kathleen...and certain questions go unanswered...Still, it's 13 hours you won't mind never getting back."
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
The Staircase,1,"There's a lot of waiting around, a lot of eavesdropping on the minutiae and small-talk of the legal system. But that offers its own insights."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase leaves you with an understanding not of how righteous justice is, but how evasive for so many, and how the best investigative work is thorough and slow-like the documentary itself."
The Staircase,1,"This three-tiered telling of ""The Staircase"" -- which builds, step by methodical step, on what transpired before -- is an extremely shrewd demonstration of getting maximum bang for its bucks."
The Staircase,1,"The Staircase demonstrates how to ride the wave of a sensational true story, zooming in on fine details before pulling back to unleash game-changing revelations at the steady rate of one stunner per episode."
The Staircase,1,"It's tricky to write about this series without giving spoilers and, by dint of it being a trial drama, it's much more satisfying..."
The Staircase,1,"Every episode is more in-depth than the last, making this series and its two sequels one of the most thorough true crime projects ever created."
The Staircase,1,"Should the outcome go one way or the other at any point in the game, one wouldn't necessarily be surprised. Engrossed, yes. And hungry for more."
The Staircase,1,"With the right approach, a complicated whodunit can supply truths about the best and worst of the human condition, even when the ""truth"" of the case is destined to remain beyond our grasp."
The Staircase,1,It's a fascinating series that well deserves to be held up as the gold standard among true crime documentary series.
The Staircase,1,"The level of detail is astonishing -- not a scintilla of the storyline is tossed aside. It's a terrific, troubling case to fall into and a sublime summer distraction in the true-crime genre."
The Staircase,1,It's a must-watch for anyone interested in true crime shows as it's not only a fascinating case on its own but really the template for so much that's on television and streaming services today.
The Staircase,1,"Far more than just a riveting mystery about whether Michael Peterson is a killer, this expanded version of The Staircase is a warts-and-all portrait of the frustrating intricacies of the American judicial system."
The Witcher,1,A more confident and cohesive second season...
The Witcher,1,"Netflix's most popular, live-action fantasy series gets better in its sprawling second season, conjuring up a more coherent plot and eliminating the multiple timelines."
The Witcher,1,"Holding true to the source material from Andrzej Sapkowski, this sword and sorcery epic made an impression."
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher season 2 finally delivers on the promise of family that season 1 set up, and it does so in the best/worst of ways, in that it gives us enough to get us invested, and then it ends when it finally seems like we're going to get more."
The Witcher,1,"By expanding its scope, The Witcher lays out its fundamental themeswho are the real monsters when humanity is in conflict with itself?on a wider canvas that leaves even more WTF world-building in its wake."
The Witcher,1,"Overall, the latest season of ""The Witcher"" is a dark fairy tale full of violence, gore (a lot of gore ... maybe too much?), and Destiny with a capital ""D."""
The Witcher,1,"A lot of gory, magic-woo-woo nonsense, trying to be the next Game of Thrones, but not taking itself too seriously."
The Witcher,1,"The show might not be important TV to many, but it's charming, never boring and filled with interesting storylines, which is more than enough for fantasy lovers looking for entertainment that honors the genre."
The Witcher,1,"Overall, The Witcher season 2 is a worthy continuation to season 1, and a great bridge for so much more Witcher to come on Netflix."
The Witcher,1,I suppose we should be glad for what we get. I just wish there was more like this to look forward to.
The Witcher,1,"I just genuinely enjoy the Witcherverse, and I'd like more of this world."
The Witcher,1,"High budget, great action and a really enjoyable, if occasionally overly bleak, story made these eight episodes fly by and I'm already looking forward to more."
The Witcher,1,"Season two of The Witcher smartly leans into character building, helping temper the sometimes confusing mythology."
The Witcher,1,"While there is a lot to like about season two of The Witcher, including some very cool monster moments, it's a real mixed bag. The writers really need to work out the strengths of the characters and what we're invested in and focus on those."
The Witcher,1,"I entirely expected Season 2 to be more of the same. It's not. It's better, at least based on the first four episodes..."
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher isn't afraid to be complicated, weird, violent, funny, magical, and horny in its second season. Who wouldn't toss a coin to that?"
The Witcher,1,Among the many things this show does right is defy the ancient sword-and-sorcery traditions of the white knight savior and the goodness of some kings countering other rulers' evil.
The Witcher,1,"For fans of this show and newcomers, ""The Witcher"" still delivers enough escapist fun."
The Witcher,1,"The next saga in the Witcher series is just getting started. While far from perfect, there's a lot to love in the way the show brings the monster-infested world to life."
The Witcher,1,"The good news about The Witcher Season 2, or at least the six (of eight) episodes that were provided to critics, is that it does away with most of those most pernicious problems."
The Witcher,1,Season two allows a deeper exploration of the forces motivating its characters.
The Witcher,1,"If you loved Season 1, you'll love [The Witcher] Season 2, and if you've been skeptical about jumping into the Continent, now is time to take the leap."
The Witcher,1,"The beauty of Game of Thrones wasn't just the size of the ensemble, but how it made full use of it. [...] The Witcher is lacking that."
The Witcher,1,"Sadly, though Season 2 continues ... stories of all our beloved characters in sometimes satisfying ways, it does so in a far less experimental manner, and suffers because of it."
The Witcher,1,I enjoyed these adventures with Geralt of Rivia far more than I did in season one and I am looking forward to even more from The Witcher for years to come.
The Witcher,1,Delightfully spooky and suspenseful.
The Witcher,1,I like The Witcher. I'm not sure why.
The Witcher,1,"Mind you, the visual effects team has had two years of COVID delay to really show what they can do, and it's an undeniably spectacular final product showcased here."
The Witcher,1,"In the most pleasant surprise of all, the series feels more emotionally effective than it ever has before."
The Witcher,1,"The writers understood what people liked and didn't like about the debut, because they give us more of the former, eliminating almost all of the latter. [Review in Spanish]"
The Witcher,0,"In its attempt to build a bigger world, the series falls prey to more fantasy tropes than it masters."
The Witcher,1,"Cavill's character has softened, emotionally and psychologically, into an unexpectedly efficient father figure, but there's still a lot of intrigue and action, too."
The Witcher,1,Henry Cavill is your new fantasy daddy.
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher had a lot to prove in returning for its second season. Could it recreate the magic -- and viewership numbers -- of Season One? And I'm here to tell you that it does, and then some."
The Witcher,1,The Witcher has ways of keeping your interest up...
The Witcher,1,"If you like your costumed fantasies mythology-forward and you find the mechanics of world building to be an end in themselves, then this new, more mysterious and portentous season of ""The Witcher"" may be for you."
The Witcher,0,"The show remains uneven and somewhat impenetrable to anyone not truly invested in it, which isn't helped by the long layoff."
The Witcher,1,"Watching the foundation get laid isn't always exciting, but it does feel like showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich is building toward rousing sequences and cares about each of the characters equally."
The Witcher,1,"we love fantasy shows because they make humanity heightened, and when you get a hero as tightly wound as Geralt, that heightening is fun to watch."
The Witcher,1,The narrative changes are much more dynamic. [Full review in Spanish]
The Witcher,1,"Season 1 of The Witcher started on shaky ground and picked up steam with each episode. The first 6 episodes of Season 2 continue its upward trend, resulting in what is easily one of Netflix's top original series."
The Witcher,1,"Season 2 is absolutely packed with action as well as essential world building that adds up to a show that is, once again, incredibly fun to watch and easy to become immersed in."
The Witcher,0,"The Witcher plods along on its wayward course, piling on complications that, by and large, fail to consistently create the type of urgent stakes-or sense of import."
The Witcher,1,"If the greatest sin The Witcher season 2 commits is being so intent on delivering more of the same but better, then fans excited to toss another coin in Geralt's direction will find a valley of plenty."
The Witcher,1,"No matter if you've read and played everything or if you're entirely new to this world, you're going to have a blast."
The Witcher,1,Yet The Witcher is still a pleasure to watch.
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher season 2 improves upon the original in almost every way. The result is a season of can't-miss television, and it's a season that should delight any fan of the franchise."
The Witcher,1,"Season two expands upon the first for a more cinematic & confident instalment, complete with improved depth of character for the central trio & an intriguing central mystery."
The Witcher,1,The pace of the series' second season allows for a more rewarding sophomore arc as it shifts focus to its characters instead of its continuity.
The Witcher,1,The season presents a strong sophomore entry for the existing fans of the show. [...But] the world is no easier to step back into and a Season One rewatch is essential...
The Witcher,1,Season 2... seems to not only have learned from the missteps of its predecessor but is even willing to gently poke fun at itself in the process.
The Witcher,1,"So far, The Witcher Season 2 holds on to just enough of its arched eyebrow to survive; here's hoping it remains the show so many became addicted to in the first place."
The Witcher,1,The Witcher's second season is vastly more confident about leaning into the high fantasy and higher stakes of Sapkowski's lore...
The Witcher,1,"The second season has great momentum that keeps it moving forward, along with an even more well-rounded cast than before. But it also felt like the show was slowly moving away from much of what made it so distinct."
The Witcher,1,The Witcher season 2 is an undeniable improvement on an unnecessarily complicated first season.
The Witcher,1,"All in all, Season 2 of The Witcheris a beautiful expansion of Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer's story, with all the witty dialogue and monster-hunting action that fans expect."
The Witcher,1,"More accessible than its complicated first season, Netflix's multi-tentacled fantasy builds on a commanding lead performance from Henry Cavill while leaning into its horror elements to increasingly impressive effect."
The Witcher,1,"The Witcher continues to be a light and entertaining adventure in its second season, despite some lingering pacing issues."
The Witcher,1,"In a world where high fantasy needs to take itself seriously in order to be taken seriously, The Witcher just about manages to be something quite rare: fun."
The Witcher,1,It's great fun provided you're willing to buy into the Playstation 4 quality of the whole thing.
The Witcher,1,"Season two is a resounding success, expanding on what we love about this world while also improving everything that held the first season back from greatness."
Mindhunter,1,Wendy and Kay's storyline on Mindhunter is a diamond in a coal mine.
Mindhunter,1,"With the legwork of the first season out of the way, the show feels like it's really gotten into a fantastic groove."
Mindhunter,1,"What Mindhunter does with the story is notable-for a series inspired by the memoirs of a profiler, it nevertheless makes the surprising choice to challenge the very foundations of psychological profiling."
Mindhunter,1,"Chilling, intriguing and beyond compelling."
Mindhunter,1,"If Season 1 of the Netflix series presented a sort of preamble to serial killer psychology, the new season expands on the mythology...If Season 1 was more theory, now it's more practice."
Mindhunter,1,Mindhunter features some unsettlingly good portrayals of notorious killers...
Mindhunter,1,"Freed from establishing the rules of its psychological game, Mindhunter proved smarter, looser, and more deeply unsettling [in season 2]."
Mindhunter,1,The second season makes [its] point without ever ceding one ounce of the authenticity or humor that made it famous in the first place.
Mindhunter,1,An imposing and ominous second season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mindhunter,1,"This season of Mindhunter gives us what we want, with our characters getting developed while offering thrilling scenes of tense conversations with killers."
Mindhunter,1,"Ford interviewing serial killers while Tench or others uneasily watch still has an incredibly high entertainment value, as Jonathan Groff excels once again at towing a very difficult line with his character."
Mindhunter,1,"What's frustrating about Mindhunter season 2 is that it's just as good, if not better than, season 1, but that it feels both unfinished and unfulfilling."
Mindhunter,1,"The writing of the show may be a little unfocused this season, but formal prowess just about makes up for all the clunky plotting."
Mindhunter,1,"As the BSU takes its business further into the wild and attempts to apply its logic to other cases, Season 2 still delivered plenty of killer soundbites and teased more cat-and-mouse games to come."
Mindhunter,1,"The politics and racial discussions in the show are thoughtful, even if they are somewhat cynical. The supporting characters take over the show, and it's for the better."
Mindhunter,1,"The soul-crushing dread that comes from looking into an abyss and realizing that you may never comprehend its nature is vividly felt in the performances of [Jonathan] Groff, [Anna] Torv and especially [Holt] McCallany."
Mindhunter,1,"Atmospheric and chilling as ever - generally without being gory beyond clinical crime scene still photos - ""Mindhunter"" remains one of the current era's best series."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter is compelling, but after watching, you might feel you need a shower."
Mindhunter,1,One of [Netflix's] most notable series. [Full review in Spanish]
Mindhunter,1,The analysis does not go deeper. It just takes another turn as the realism is considered as motive. [Full review in Spanish].
Mindhunter,1,"All in all, season 2 ups the ante and improves upon the already brilliant 1st season replete with strong performances across the board. If you haven't yet seen this latest Netflix venture you really ought to. It will not disappoint."
Mindhunter,1,"It's all wonderfully rich material that the creative team, headed by David Fincher, makes the most of. And there's plenty of movement plot-wise, too."
Mindhunter,1,"I wasn't as turned on by the new season of Mindhunter, but it continues to be a provocative vehicle for raising questions about workplace ethics, and gender, sexual and racial politics."
Mindhunter,1,Excellent performances. [Full review in Spanish]
Mindhunter,1,"By yanking [Holden Ford] into season 2, a story with more nuance and care than he seems capable of, the series holds a mirror to the revered concept of the callous genius."
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mindhunter,1,"It's all very, very dark, which for me is very, very intriguing."
Mindhunter,1,"Andrew Dominik and Carl Franklin ensure that the handsome cinematography and meticulous attention to detail is maintained throughout. Jason Hill's eerie score further adds to the dark, chilling ambience."
Mindhunter,1,"Compelling as it may be, Mindhunter does not make for easy television - by its very nature, it's frustrating and cruel, caring not a jot for resolution or conventional payoffs."
Mindhunter,1,"A show full of sad, dark conversations in rooms has become a hypnotic exploration of how we keep our own houses in order when working with madmen."
Mindhunter,1,"It doesn't appear the popularity of true crime media will subside anytime soon. As frightening and macabre as these sinister people and acts may be, it's endlessly fascinating."
Mindhunter,1,While Mindhunter exploits society's obsession with scary monsters - that indefensible yet commonplace notion of serial killers as celebrities - it manages to remain rooted in history and research.
Mindhunter,1,"The late Seventies-set tale oozes style and class, as one might expect when director David Fincher (Seven, Network, The Social Network), among others, is on the team."
Mindhunter,1,"Season two is just as clever, but it has a lot more heart - emotional intelligence, a psychologist might say."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter is an acquired taste but, for those who enjoy its languid pace and cerebral tone, the new series does not disappoint."
Mindhunter,1,The show's second season reveals the intricate intersections between personal and political neuroses.
Mindhunter,1,"[It] isn't fixated on solving any particular cases but taking time to study the methodological eccentricity of each crime and the increasingly dark obsession of the detectives, sucked ever more inextricably into the transgressive vortex."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter's second season is absorbing, upsetting, and fascinating, and it leaves us wanting more. Television can't do much better than that."
Mindhunter,1,"From the little I've seen, the high standards of season 1 haven't dipped a bit."
Mindhunter,1,"Thankfully, season 2 delivers more structure and story across nine episodes, more deeply acquainting us with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit."
Mindhunter,1,"That Mindhunter manages to be a satisfying FBI mystery on top of that is a testament to its sharp directing and mostly smart writing, even as some threads never quite come together."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter grips you -- not with the promise of some big reveal, but for what it chooses to unravel in the story of killers who've controlled their seductive narratives for far too long."
Mindhunter,1,"If you are going to spend your weekend guiltily luxuriating in a show about the depths of human depravity, you might as well make it a stylish one."
Mindhunter,1,"What's most compelling about Mindhunter is the way that, like its protagonists, it investigates the human response to violent crime and, in particular, the way that close proximity to such crime can burnish one's image."
Mindhunter,1,Mindhunter's second season embraces a world where enduring mysteries don't always have satisfying conclusions.
Mindhunter,1,"While it mostly hangs together for now, there are already more signs of strain than there were back in 2017."
Mindhunter,1,"It is effective, haunting, scary, and one of the most provocative shows ever and hands down one of the best shows of the year"
Mindhunter,1,"While the series benefits from giving everyone more to do, the pacing could be quicker."
Mindhunter,1,Things really fall apart before they come back together for our Mindhunters.
Mindhunter,1,"After all is said and done, Mindhunter's sophomore effort shows an ambition when it comes to its craft."
Mindhunter,1,"""Mindhunter"" succeeds again because its quality has not diminished."
Mindhunter,1,Mindhunter season 1 established the rules. Mindhunter season 2 proceeds to break them.
Mindhunter,1,"David Fincher takes a perverse, almost lusty thrill in exploring the minds of serial killers. It's incredibly nerdy fun."
Mindhunter,1,The series feeds more on the idea that knowledge and understanding of the human condition - in all its sometimes horrific glory - is what's truly fascinating.
Mindhunter,1,"Finding a way to never show that which is supposed to be scaring us is so, so, so hard, and Mindhunter succeeds at it more often than not, usually by careful shot selection, terrific performances, and expertly calibrated dialogue."
Mindhunter,1,"While Mindhunter: Season 2 doesn't exactly race out of the gate as it builds on the foundation of Season 1, it remains a compelling and impeccably shot crime thriller."
Mindhunter,1,"""Mindhunter"" is deeper, richer, and more affecting this go round, even as it steers away from studying proven killers."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter's most impressive accomplishment, though, is to weave an engrossing mystery without trivialising these real-life killers and their atrocious crimes. The series fascinates rather than unsettles."
Mindhunter,1,"Mindhunter is a series about difficult conversations - with bosses, with family members, with serial killers - and none of that would work without its impeccable ensemble."
Mindhunter,1,David Fincher's drama returns with new terrors and a greater emphasis on its central trio
Mindhunter,1,"It's chilling stuff that burrows under your skin, and not suited to delicate constitutions."
Mindhunter,1,The long-awaited second season of David Fincher's Mindhunter affirms the program as Netflix's strongest drama.
Mindhunter,1,"Compared to the last season, 'Mindhunter' Season 2 works on a bigger canvas, but doesn't lose any of its focus."
Mindhunter,1,A stupendous season 2. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mindhunter,1,"Maybe everything really is coming up Mindhunter. But in the dark and cruel world these characters live in, it all seems awfully convenient."
Mindhunter,1,"As with last season, David Fincher directs the first episode with his usual panache, especially during the cold open."
Mindhunter,1,"There's a recalibrating of Ford that includes panic attacks and a consequent popping of Valium, one of several character developments to remind us that Mindhunter isn't too cool for detective-show tropes."
Mindhunter,1,"The series is still far more Zodiac than Seven, but it's also more propulsive now, with no fewer than three ongoing investigations."
Mindhunter,1,"It already feels like the series is evolving and maturing, becoming more complex as the relationships start to change, both professionally and personally."
Mindhunter,1,"Those who slept on season one should take note; David Fincher is at his full power on Netflix and makes ""Mindhunter"" a must-watch."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is definitely back, entertainingly so, and serving up another wonderful on-screen matryoshka doll of life-pondering insights and time-twisting trickery for audiences to entrancingly unstack."
Russian Doll,1,"It's not quite as riveting as the terrific first outing, but the trippy second season's imaginative twists and turns are sure to vibe with fans of offbeat comedy dramas."
Russian Doll,1,"Natasha Lyonne is always entertaining to watch, but Russian Doll feels less special the second time around."
Russian Doll,1,"The reason to watch is the rude and edgy convictions of its star, whose wisecracking, strutting Nadia is one of streaming’s greats. You probably wouldn’t want to spend any actual time with the character, but she’s fine while contained by a screen."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll 2 jumps the shark quickly; the narrative is too different, and meanderingly self-indulgent, and the charm of the cast wears thin"
Russian Doll,1,"They managed to give all the characters something to do in this new iteration, and I like the fact that it went into new territory but kept the same logical world that exists for what they set up in Season 1."
Russian Doll,1,"Intelligently written and stylishly crafted, Russian Doll remains as entertaining and as mind-bending in its first season, with a voice that feels wholly its own."
Russian Doll,1,"Raw, bruising, and existentially heavier than its predecessor. If the first installment felt miraculously complete, the seven new episodes feel instead like a slide down into a darker space."
Russian Doll,1,"With its expanded new cast and twisting multiverse plot, Russian Doll pulls out all the stops to create a thrilling season of television."
Russian Doll,1,The show is a shining example of how the sci-fi genre doesn’t have to consist of laundry lists of nonsense fake science terms and explosions; it can be used to tell thoughtful stories that speak to the roots of human nature.
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll‘s acerbic wit, sharp writing and exploration of complex themes make it endlessly rewatchable in my book."
Russian Doll,1,"Any show that finds a way to use Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus” not once, but twice, will make a believer out of me."
Russian Doll,0,"It is an ambitious but ultimately lacking attempt at illustrating how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, at the expense of the protagonists’ development and season one friendship."
Russian Doll,1,"I never thought this season would be possible, and not only is it good but it will certainly be considered one of the best shows of 2022."
Russian Doll,1,"I mean -- you could try and watch it in instalments, but the lure of binge-watching in a single session is just way too powerful to resist."
Russian Doll,0,"The altered nature of Nadia and Alan’s predicament mostly just feels like, “Well, we got picked up for another season, so why not?”"
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll season two is a mind-bending, time-bending, genre-bending wonder that more than proves its right to exist."
Russian Doll,1,There is still plenty to dig into.
Russian Doll,1,"Instead of feeling like a rehash, “Russian Doll” becomes even more of a funny, evocative story."
Russian Doll,1,"The wider scope and deeper questions of Russian Doll’s second season thrillingly build on the first season’s foundation, and bring the viewer along for an extremely satisfying ride."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll manages to pack in big laughs, real emotional moments, and an effective time-traveling plot that fits right in with what happened during the show’s trippy first season."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is still the Russian Doll we know and love. Its humor, its darkness, its curiosity in the history of the self in the context of greater history let it stand apart in the television landscape."
Russian Doll,1,"This new season is less a Russian doll than a Fabergé egg. Gilded, ornate, almost ostentatiously clever and beguiling, but with that crucial surprise -- a nugget of emotional clarity -- that emerges as the egg is cracked."
Russian Doll,1,"If Russian Doll were a place, it would be less like the grid plan of Manhattan and more like the incoherence of Boston. But Ms. Lyonne is certainly an entertaining tour guide."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll's second season finds a way to keep the feistiness of time trickery alive with a Quantum Leap-style story that, of course, leads to wonderfully tender and meaningful catharsis."
Russian Doll,1,"Its all about discovery with Russian Doll, they do not hide the festering wound of the human spirit."
Russian Doll,1,"While fascinating, the sophomore season doesn’t quite have the magic of the zeitgeist-capturing first season."
Russian Doll,1,"""Doll"" didn't really need to come back, but Lyonne and the writers found a way to advance the story without ruining it."
Russian Doll,1,"“Russian Doll” turns somersaults to get where it’s going, but its conclusions are emotionally unambiguous and universally useful and consonant with the previous season’s themes of attachment and surrender."
Russian Doll,1,"After the first series achieved that rarest of feats — a truly neat and satisfying ending — this largely enjoyable new instalment feels just a little more jumbled, and a little less than necessary."
Russian Doll,1,"It dares to ask big questions about trauma, grief and fate. If that doesn’t sound amusing, well, it still manages to be."
Russian Doll,1,Lyonne reveals the exhaustion and exhilaration of carrying so many multitudes within. She makes complexity look easy.
Russian Doll,1,"It was always going to be difficult for any follow-up to have the same impact given that first season was so snappy and smart, but even a dimmed second season is better than 95 per cent of what you find on any streaming platform."
Russian Doll,1,"I liked it more than the first season and, perhaps because I was able to identify more with some themes than in the first, I couldn't stop watching it until the end. Highly recommended. Full review in Spanish"
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is delightful, dense, and thought-provoking."
Russian Doll,1,"The show’s new season with Natasha Lyonne at the helm is more honest, more experimental, and more reflective of its maker."
Russian Doll,1,"Multiverses and diverging timelines are everywhere in movies and TV lately, but as with the first season, Russian Doll confidently forges its own path."
Russian Doll,1,"In its second season, iRussian Dolli continues to straddle the line between realist tragicomedy and run-of-the-mill sci-fi."
Russian Doll,1,"Under its trippy surface, the story is anchored by humanity."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll is intriguing and unpredictable, with its own distinct edge. It may not have needed a sequel, but it makes for a comforting return to a whacky pre-Covid 19 world."
Russian Doll,1,"While it may not live up to the tightly-wound brilliance of its freshman season, there’s still a lot to love."
Russian Doll,1,"That first season set a very high bar, so even though season two can easily be classified as a disappointment, there is still much to delight in."
Russian Doll,1,"A very worthy follow-up, finding a new time-tripping premise that recaptures the sci-fi fun of Season 1. Most importantly, though, it serves as a fantastic showcase for Lyonne."
Russian Doll,1,"Nadia’s wit and fabulous hair remain firmly intact, and it is satisfying to see the lovable, imperfect protagonist on the small screen again."
Russian Doll,1,"This season is more like Back to the Future crossed with Quantum Leap. It’s a messier fantasy than the perfectly contained first season, but still smart and absorbing -- a head trip well worth taking."
Russian Doll,1,"""Russian Doll"" season 2 is messy and complicated, but ultimately emotionally enlightening  just like the trauma therapy it represents."
Russian Doll,1,"As season 2 nears its end, it progressively becomes more metaphorical, embracing its science-fiction credentials with much gusto, all the while showcasing the inherent humor embedded in each of its scenes."
Russian Doll,1,"An absorbing lead performance from Natasha Lyonne is the guiding light of the shows success, and the actress continues to bring the same charisma she initially infused into the role."
Russian Doll,1,"This time travel story is more traditional and a little less fun than last season’s perpetual weird night out, but it’s still a treat to spend time with one of modern television’s most interesting characters."
Russian Doll,1,"A relatively quick viewing experience and, for the most part, a distinct successor to 2019’s original run... But Season 2 ultimately suffers from a lack of momentum and misguided assembly."
Russian Doll,1,"With its second season, Russian Doll crafts a narrative that is far more confounding and less structured than the first, and while it might not always work, the result is a season that is far more layered, emotionally satisfying, and engrossing..."
Russian Doll,1,"Between Lyonne's performance and many moments of interdimensional claustrophobia, it effectively plays into the strengths of the first season without simply repeating them."
Russian Doll,1,"Its exploration of how fruitless ""what if"" thinking is and the importance of taking agency in your own life despite your generational baggage builds wonderfully on the themes explored in the first season."
Russian Doll,1,"Season Two is no lazy rehash. The tone is similar, even though the story and sci-fi gimmick are different. In many ways, it’s more audacious in scope and themes."
Russian Doll,1,"Russian Doll Season 2 is good, but it’s not quite as great as Russian Doll Season 1."
Russian Doll,1,"For the most part, while the experimental aspects of this season didn’t fully work, I do think the risks are worth taking. More TV should be weirder!"
Russian Doll,1,"After too long away, Netflix subscribers are in for a treat as they unpack Russian Doll once again."
Russian Doll,1,"Stepping to the forefront of the show’s creative team, Natasha Lyonne has delivered seven episodes that are more personal and take bigger intellectual risks than anything in the initial run."
Russian Doll,1,Nadia and the show both allow themselves to get messier than either might’ve thought possible after Season 1’s conclusion.
Russian Doll,1,"It reinvents its protagonists and its mythology, using the duo’s complex ancestry as a gut punch to further develop them."
Russian Doll,1,"Time travel was a clever way to keep Russian Doll Season 2 in the same milieu, while trying something different. Season 3 will have to go into the future or into space to really explore everything science fiction has to offer."
Sex Education,1,"Arguably the jewel in Netflix's queer representation crown, Sex Education, does not get enough credit for how well-crafted, well-written, and caring it is when it comes to attention to stories of teen sexual identity and orientation."
Sex Education,1,"No one series can undo generations of stereotypes and blind spots within the coming-of-age sub-genre, but that wont stop Sex Education from trying."
Sex Education,1,"We've long ignored great performances in teen-centric series. So it's a shame that Asa Butterfield, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, and Gillian Anderson in the performance that she should have won the Emmy for (not The Crown), keep being passed over."
Sex Education,1,A show that explores its subjects far beyond the surface level. [Full review in Spanish]
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education keeps getting better because it approaches storytelling the way it teaches us to approach sex - with curiosity, excitement, and a willingness to learn."
Sex Education,1,"This colourful, honest and non-judgmental series doesn't treat sex with kid gloves or mince words with euphemisms."
Sex Education,0,"For the first time, Sex Education seems to be trying to figure out what type of show it wants to be."
Sex Education,1,"Season 3 sheds more light on [Jean's] views on motherhood, independence, and her fears. If Eric is the heart of the series, Jean is the architect behind everyone's emotional journey."
Sex Education,1,I was completely blown away by how much this show has changed from its very first episode. This is the best show on Netflix right now.
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education's third season is, frankly, great, with strong writing, direction, and performances. It's a must see."
Sex Education,1,"All the young actors shine, but none of them more than Ncuti Gatwa, who plays Eric with an energy and resilience that is inspiring to watch. This season, Gatwa isn't just a joy; he brings more nuance and authenticity than ever."
Sex Education,1,"This season is entertainment in its purest form. It is raw, unafraid, and brilliant with how it handles its characters."
Sex Education,1,"The show has trouble maintaining the sheer volume of story involving so many characters, and unfortunately, any single review of the season simply cannot cover it all. Every plot is worth taking a look at, though."
Sex Education,1,No show currently on TV is as progressive as Sex Education. That makes it a gem.
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education season 3 is full of fan service for the devoted viewer - but it's to its credit as well as its detriment. They're pushing their limits, but Sex Education provides a world that lets them get away with it."
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education returns with another wonderfully raunchy and riotous season filled with lovable characters and insightful inclusion. Like the character of Otis, the show is hopped up on hormones and surprisingly wise about it."
Sex Education,1,"Every show covets the kind of character development and narrative strength on display here, and Sex Education makes it look easy."
Sex Education,1,"The drama that springs between characters isn't as earthshaking as the drama rising at Moordale, and this may be ""Sex Education""s most important detail. Relationships will always, always meet conflict"
Sex Education,1,A sub-par Sex Education is still a good and joyful thing.
Sex Education,1,In Season 3 Lily is not just a joke; she's simply a person who can't help being herself. Reynolds has previously been a strong comedic player but here she finally gets to show her capability for dramatic depth.
Sex Education,1,Sex Education season three really is the binge-watch you've been waiting for.
Sex Education,1,"The magic of the show remains that nothing 'heavy' ever feels hectoring, tokenising or clumsy. In fact, the lightness of touch does it all."
Sex Education,1,"This time ahead of season three can instead be used to highlight a poignant message regarding the importance of individuality, uniqueness and embracing one's identity."
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education, once again, masters the difficult undertaking of being both entertaining and enlightening."
Sex Education,1,"The show remains comical, relevant, and fun."
Sex Education,1,"What holds it all together is a real sense that as funny as all this is to the observer, when you're at that age, in that place, it all feels titanically important."
Sex Education,1,"On the whole, it's a very satisfying bounce-back year that suggests Sex Education would still have stories to tell in a fourth (and, given the characters' ages, presumably final) season."
Sex Education,1,"Quietly subversive, proudly progressive, and blessed with a delicate, empathic tone; Netflix's deceptively titled show remains wildly stimulating."
Sex Education,1,"As we reach the third season, it's time to say that Sex Education has passed the test. It hasn't befallen to third season syndrome, and it's kept the story consistent and informative."
Sex Education,1,"Yet another hilarious, heartfelt and deeply honest season for the Netflix gem."
Sex Education,1,What makes Sex Education stand out from the crowded genre of high school content is how it's not afraid to address things that others skate over.
Sex Education,1,"In its third outing, the series remains cringingly honest and engagingly heartfelt, with just the right amount of pathos and the occasional outrageous sight gag."
Sex Education,1,"The show once again does an excellent job of showcasing its lesser-seen, supporting characters, who are still in need of sex advice, particularly with Otis and Maeve now retired from their clinic side-hustle."
Sex Education,1,"It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and even after eight (almost) hour-long episodes, it'll somehow still leave you wanting more."
Sex Education,1,"It continuously seeks out subjects and identities that have been marginalised or stigmatised, and finds new ways to work them into a comedy framework without sacrificing heart and integrity."
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education retains its inherent sweetness and relatability, fleshing out its protagonists' backstories and friendships without seeming overstuffed or superficial."
Sex Education,1,"Sex Education season 3 proves the show is just as fun as ever with belly laughs and emotional moments in spades, even if some elements are a little too one dimensional and has the potential to frustrate."
Sex Education,1,...quite possibly the best season of Sex Education so far.
Sex Education,1,"Season 3 has been a long time coming, but it's absolutely worth the wait, so strap in and enjoy the ride!"
Love & Anarchy,1,"Love & Anarchy takes the formula it established in its first season and shakes it up, sending the show in an interesting new direction that keeps the spirit of its first season intact."
Black Summer,1,"It is intense, and certainly not a show for everyone. For those who like their zombie shows pure, uncut, and undiluted, however, Black Summer continues to do the trick in season two."
Black Summer,1,"More accomplished and more confident, Black Summer ends with enough mysteries and unanswered questions to merit a third season."
Black Summer,1,"The randomness of their deaths, and knowing that anyone could go at any time, is a huge part of Black Summer's appeal. But because it's so relentless, character beats are few and far between, which also means you end up caring about them far less too."
Black Summer,1,"Black Summer is currently one of the best zombie entries across media in season 2 here, and a picture of what The Walking Dead has lost over the years, and something it can probably never reach, given the formula it's now locked into."
Black Summer,1,"Black Summer getting a Season 2 is a wild and wonderful thing but if Season 1 had been the end for the show, it would have been hauntingly excellent."
Black Summer,1,"This season dives even deeper into the human interactions, but the narrative structure and brilliant cinematography were the standouts this time around."
Black Summer,1,"Don't be gulled by ""zombie apocalypse."" This ain't The Walking Dead or any of its spinoffs. It's formally brilliant, politically loaded, terse and mind-blowing."
Black Summer,1,Black Summer has encapsulated the intricacies of human flaws.
Bridgerton,1,"Promises more of the same, but better... [Full review in Spanish]"
Bridgerton,1,"In its reimagining of Regency-era London (between 1811 and 1820), Bridgerton continues to be colourful and colour-blind."
Bridgerton,1,"This season is more ""Pride & Prejudice"" than Season 1 which was more ""Fifty Shades  of Gray."""
Bridgerton,1,"Season 2 is not quite as risqué as season 1, but the fireworks between Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley are off the charts. And all the supporting characters continue to provide compelling storylines that will have you YEARNING for next season."
Bridgerton,0,"Season 1 may have left audiences hot under the collar and begging for more the first time around, unfortunately its successor is more likely to leave viewers yawning, such is the state of affairs with season two."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
Bridgerton,0,"Now that we’ve all binged the new season of Netflix’s Regency romance, let’s unpack the biggest disappointment: How did our beloved Penelope become the absolute worst?"
Bridgerton,1,"The frothy period drama struggles in some areas, particularly with its handling of race, but its new cast members and high production values make up for it."
Bridgerton,1,"While the season struggles with its story, it NAILS the foreplay. Kate and Anthony are all about the LONGING and the YEARNING and the PINING."
Bridgerton,1,"The second season lacks the sexy spice of the first, focusing on the slowly simmering romance between far less interesting characters. Nevertheless, it's addictive..."
Bridgerton,1,"I mean, we have Anthony sniffing the fragrance that surrounds Kate like a man obsessed  romantic TV doesnt get any better than this."
Bridgerton,1,"Weve reviewed so many period dramas that always feel the same  theyre always static, laboured and slow. Bridgerton is like the antidote to all of that."
Bridgerton,1,"They seemed to have a very clear idea of what the main three players needed to be, but maybe felt a draft or two away from smoothly transitioning those stories between the polite societal standards and volatile horniness they all engage in."
Bridgerton,1,Many of the main characters’ faces are now a little too familiar; some of the charm (and the sex) of the first installment are gone. But it’s still a comfy watch for the undemanding.
Bridgerton,0,"Even at its best, Bridgerton was never high-minded in what it had to offer, but at least it was a harmlessly salacious good time. Now that’s gone, the period drama is little more than a glass of champagne carelessly left out all night."
Bridgerton,1,Season two arrives keeping the soapiness intact while surprisingly toning down the saucier material.
Bridgerton,1,"The new season of the Netflix smash hit may not be as physical, but in the crackling chemistry and relentless self-denial that defines the leads’ dynamic, there’s plenty of eroticism."
Bridgerton,1,"While Anthony and Kates story isnt quite the bodice-ripper that its predecessor was, its still plenty watchable. Bridgerton may not be on fire this season, but its still got its spark."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton 2 is all fine escapist fun, and it’s probably more tightly-written than the first series, but its revised format lacks the shock-and-awe impact of its predecessor."
Bridgerton,1,"This is, indeed, more a tale of longing and, yes, withholding -- but emotionally, not in the ‘Hot Simon’ sense -- yet it’s still gorgeous, silly, spirited fun, and so moreish."
Bridgerton,1,"Chemistry matters in a romance and it has been so long since I’ve seen really good ones on screen, so not only was this a delight to watch, but I actually felt satisfied with the relationship."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton season two has gone in the opposite direction. The result is a season that will likely delight returning and new Bridgerton viewers, but may disappoint fans of the source material."
Bridgerton,1,"This sophomore run is simply not as effusive a watch... That said, many of the series pleasures still remain intact"
Bridgerton,1,"From the overdressed sets to the overdressed cast, it is a show that indulges our basest qualities, but does so delightfully."
Bridgerton,0,"While the actors brought it in season 2, there was a spark missing in this season due to the writing, pacing, and production choices."
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
Bridgerton,1,"Even without the sex, it excels at the colourful, colour-blind, MTV Jane Austen genre that it has invented."
Bridgerton,0,"The hit series Bridgerton returns with diminished swagger. Not only has The Gilded Age taken the lead on lavish costumes and set decoration, the new season begins with considerably less heat and a tendency to the ridiculous."
Bridgerton,1,"The sophomore outing of Bridgerton is just as delightful as its first, even if it’s much safer. The Shondaland-produced series is still an effortlessly binge-able, dreamy fantasy of a diverse and passionate Regency-era London."
Bridgerton,1,The new run of Bridgerton has less sex -- but is sexier than the first season. It's also more compelling in almost every way.
Bridgerton,1,"It’s a wonderful escape from today’s insanity, and you can transport yourself to a place where you know you’re guaranteed to witness a happily ever after."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton remains a cleverly conceived modern wrinkle on the Jane Austen formula, down to its anachronisms, like playing a musical version of Madonna's ""Material Girl"" as accompaniment for a debutante ball."
Bridgerton,1,"From the opening moments of its long-awaited second season, the sumptuous drama proves it’s lost none of its sparkle."
Bridgerton,1,The anachronistic soundtrack works great -- Nirvana’s “Stay Away” is perfect for standoffish neurotic Lord B. And the show is still way more satisfying than The Bachelor.
Bridgerton,1,"For all its sexy delights, Season 1 is much shakier than this more confident and more restrained second season."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton is in fine health and ready for what will doubtless be many more seasons. Next time, though, it might need to work harder to feel new."
Bridgerton,1,"Take my word, dear reader, this second helping of the smash Netflix series still smolders. Despite  a drag at midpoint and the no-show of season-one sex magnet Regé-Jean Page, the dishy cosplay brims over with eye-popping spectacle and ravishing romance."
Bridgerton,1,"I love the series’ repositioning of history and society, its diversity and the art design /wardrobe is to die for."
Bridgerton,1,"Characters old and new almost burst with vim, vigour, machination and comedic foible in every corner."
Bridgerton,1,"While the privileged atmosphere, back-stabbing, rampant rutting and frocks are certainly part of the Bridgerton allure, so is the refreshing acknowledgment of how dumb it all is. Even the carriage horses seem to be in on the joke."
Bridgerton,1,"While the hit drama has been known for its outlandish plots, soapy elements, and everything in between, the storytelling on Bridgerton Season 2 is far tighter than its predecessor."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton remains gorgeously frothy, deeply silly and highly watchable - its legions of fans will eat this up. The honeymoon period might be over, but this romance looks like it will go the distance."
Bridgerton,1,"Where the first season of the show was compelling because it's groundbreaking in so many ways, its romance between two beautiful people who have the hots for each other pales in comparison to the barbed sexual tension between Season 2's leads."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton is still a great show and is worth the watch, but for me, I just didn’t feel the burn this time around."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
Bridgerton,0,Season 2 timidly skimmed the surface of such representation when I needed it to leap into sumptuous storytelling. I couldn’t escape into it while I was also trying to navigate its unsatisfying approach to inclusivity.
Bridgerton,0,"As soaps go, one can certainly do worse than Bridgerton, but season two... feels like a bland mimeograph of season one."
Bridgerton,1,"I breezed through all eight episodes, never surprised, but always pleased by what I saw -- especially whenever the wonderful Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury is on screen."
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Bridgerton,0,"Theres something to be said for familiarity, but Bridgerton keeps most of the less interesting stuff from last season and jettisons the scandalous intrigue we tuned in for in the first place."
Bridgerton,1,"""Bridgerton"" has a strong sophomore season that should keep its fans happy, even if they might wonder where all the sex scenes went."
Bridgerton,0,"All the crowded balls, deer hunts and horse races in the world can’t distract from the second iteration’s greatest disappointment: its utter expectedness."
Bridgerton,1,"It could be that Lady Whistledown isn’t the only one who sees where all of this is going — but what a lovely, colorful, steamy and gorgeous ride we’re all taking."
Bridgerton,0,"Aren’t these boring statements of morality the exact thing last season flouted with its copious, luxuriant shots? Bridgerton, it’s like I don’t even know you anymore!"
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
Bridgerton,1,"It’s all done with buoyant wit, both in front of and behind the camera."
Bridgerton,1,"Prepare for big reveals, unexpected liaisons, scene-stealing turns from Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) and Lady Danbury (​​Adjoa Andoh) and tear-jerking moments..."
Bridgerton,1,"Season 2 does a fine job of keeping fans gleeful while being much more probing and, in the end, quite superior to the first season."
Bridgerton,1,"While not as steamy as season one, season two thrives when focusing on the central romance. The chemistry is on full display, and the world around them is fleshed out well."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
Bridgerton,1,"It would behoove this show to focus more on the compelling, seductive romance it has in the present rather than setting sights too far ahead to next season's drama."
Bridgerton,1,"Despite its positives, Bridgerton is ultimately not as fully, effectively transportive this go-round."
Bridgerton,1,There are also lots of swoonworthy moments viewers will go nuts for
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton Season 2 is still really enjoyable television and there’s a lot to like here... The end result is something that is, on all accounts, honestly mostly fine, but that is ultimately tarnished by the memory of how good what came before it was."
Bridgerton,1,"It may falter a little in one of its subplots, but the developments within the Bridgerton family, the central romance, and the saga of Lady Whistledown ensure that this follow-up is far from a disappointment."
Bridgerton,1,"While its not as raunchy as the first season, in many ways this season is more romantic and I dont think the returning audience (unless theyre maybe die-hard fans of the books) will be disappointed. Bailey is outstanding, as are the costumes."
Bridgerton,1,Those looking for romantic escapism with picture-perfect historic detail could do a lot worse than Bridgerton.
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
Bridgerton,1,"We are not often prone to Shakespearean language, dear reader, but one might suspect a shrew is ready to be tamed. The only question is which, the lady or the viscount?"
Bridgerton,1,"Still beautiful, still fun and still excellent."
Bridgerton,1,"With the added complexity of the tensions caused by Lady Whistledown, Season 2 of Bridgerton is a fun, light-hearted, and classical watch."
Bridgerton,1,"Bridgerton Season 2 is very much not an adaptation of The Viscount Who Loved Me. If anything, Season 2 is loosely inspired by the book, and nothing more."
Bridgerton,1,"Season 2 brings new drama, new love interests, and a new match season  but it doesnt hold a candle to the entertainment of season 1."
Bridgerton,1,"Season two of Bridgerton still is very much steamy and sexy, between Anthonys frequent shirtlessness and, especially, because its difficult to take your eyes off of Simone Ashley and Jonathan Bailey every time their characters bicker."
Bridgerton,1,"Now that we’re all a bit less delirious, we can judge the arrival of series two on its dramatic merits. And it is still silly fun, though the novelty has worn off."
Bridgerton,1,"'Bridgerton' Season 2 isnt terrible, but it isnt wonderful. There are some engaging moments, themes, and scenes. However, there are annoying and repetitive components that can take someone completely out of it."
Bridgerton,0,"While “Bridgerton” Season 2 arrives with all of the scandal, gossip, and sartorial excellence we’ve become accustomed to, the sophomore outing lacks the fresh appeal and engaging pace of the first season."
Bridgerton,1,"As deliberately frustrating as the main love story becomes, the actors playing it are very, very good."
Bridgerton,1,"Whatever its stumbles in other areas, Bridgerton continues to nail it in the one arena that counts most — its central romance."
Bridgerton,1,A sophomore season that all but drives its predecessor from memory.
Bridgerton,1,"It may never reach the status of high art, but as high camp and escapist entertainment it’s pretty irreproachable."
Bridgerton,1,Exuberant and swooningly romantic...
Bridgerton,1,"With a second season that's more clever, moving, and emotionally complex than the first, this period drama proves that it's not just a titillating trifle."
Bridgerton,1,Yearning can be just as satisfying as burning. It just takes a little longer.
Bridgerton,0,"Although it's hardly a failure, Bridgerton Season 2 suffers from too many extraneous storylines and not focusing enough on its leading two characters, and that's where it falls short."
Bridgerton,1,Has a clever way to create new chemistry without repeating itself.
Inventing Anna,1,An irrestistible story.... [Full review in Spanish]
Inventing Anna,1,"Holding it all together is Garner, who makes Anna a charismatic enigma, chic behind huge sunglasses, speaking in an odd German-meets-Russian accent, sometimes engaging, other times appallingly superficial..."
Inventing Anna,0,"As watchable as the show can be, one cant help but see the better version lurking beneath the surface. Ultimately, iInventing Annai misses the point of what made Delveys story a viral sensation."
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Inventing Anna,1,"Ultimately, viewers are left with a captivating story about a Gen-Zer who almost girlbossed her way to the top. The series could have greatly benefited from a tighter narrative, providing an insiders look at the modern jet set"
Inventing Anna,1,"One of the most fascinating series of the year so far, playing right into our collective loves of gossip and scandal  because Rhimes knows exactly what shes doing."
Inventing Anna,0,"What’s the point? In the case of Inventing Anna, the answer is some ethically muddled, bizarrely patronizing mumbo-jumbo about how women are punished for doing things that men get away with. Okay? Is that all?"
Inventing Anna,0,A dull spin on an otherwise captivating story...
Inventing Anna,1,"The episodes become more intriguing as you go, and each are peppered with a host of recognizable Shondaland thesps. Standouts include the fabulous Kate Burton, hottie James Cusati-Moyer, Anna Deavere Smith and the real star of the show Anna Chlumsky..."
Inventing Anna,1,"It takes very real people, inspires a few fictional characters and fully runs with it."
Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled."
Inventing Anna,1,"Even when Inventing Anna comes off as vapid as its main character, it’s worth checking out purely for how much it revels in overindulgence. There’s more than enough to fill you up."
Inventing Anna,0,"The show certainly provides indulgence (if maybe not enough for my taste). Its failure is in the framing of Delvey’s story: It’s depicted as a quasi-feminist, girlboss-adjacent revenge fantasy."
Inventing Anna,1,Inventing Anna is one of the best new series of 2022. Its a grimy and uncomfortable con-story that keeps you guessing until the end.
Inventing Anna,1,"In all honesty, I appreciated the show’s refusal to reproduce the same bland, measured morality tale we always get when TV rips scammer stories from the headlines."
Inventing Anna,1,Settle in for an utterly bingeable bit of fluff about a woman who is never quite who she claims to be.
Inventing Anna,1,"""Too bad the series wastes s so much time on the whiny, annoying journalist (Anna Chlumsky), rather than brazen, manipulative Anna and her gullible victims."""
Inventing Anna,0,"As a true-crime nerd, I followed the story, and I thought it would be an interesting tale to dramatize. Yet, what came about was... a mess."
Inventing Anna,1,"while Inventing Anna is a dubious proposition morally, its more-ish as a television spectacle"
Inventing Anna,1,Julia Garner is the Meryl Streep of our generation.
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna’s chronic inability to get to the point is reflected in its sprawling nine-episode length, each one lasting an hour or more, not least because the show keeps recycling its own flashbacks as if poking us to stay awake."
Inventing Anna,1,"Garner’s performance (and accent) are as electric as one would expect here, and it’s a real treat to watch her go."
Inventing Anna,1,A fascinating and frustrating watch.
Inventing Anna,1,"The true story it's based on is fascinatingly bizarre, and so is this series stocked with sublime actors, but using the journalist who broke Sorokin's tale as an entry point was a tactical error."
Inventing Anna,1,"Garner fully commits to the role without missing its comedic beats. She seems to both be steeped in Anna’s world and ironically to the side of it -- in a series that is often flattened by its formal mediocrity, hers is an excellent performance."
Inventing Anna,1,"Inventing Anna is as easily digestible and enjoyable as that of can’t-miss first season Scandal even if, in the end, it feels a little hollow."
Inventing Anna,1,“Inventing Anna” isn’t a tough watch. The actors do a lot to compensate for what’s missing.
Inventing Anna,1,"This might not be the Anna Delvey drama we expected. Its more trash than grit, though undeniably enjoyable. Once you try to take it as seriously as her crimes, its hard to see Inventing Anna as anything other than a very expensive PR campaign."
Inventing Anna,1,"If youre looking for an in-depth analytical exploration into her behaviour, this wont be the Netflix drama for you. If youre looking for a Real Housewives meet Gossip Girl drama about scamming the snobby wealthy of New York, youre in for a treat."
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
Inventing Anna,1,"Sometimes there is no morality tale -- because your subject is simply amoral. It’s not a comfortable ending, but perhaps, like Anna, we don’t deserve one."
Inventing Anna,1,"It is one of those shows that plunges you straight into the heartless world of the very, very rich and it is fascinating."
Inventing Anna,1,"What keeps giving oxygen to a cluttered series is Garner’s snappy performance, which grows more intense as her character races towards a famous downfall."
Inventing Anna,0,"An overwrought, overlong mess, with writing and performances that feel too over the top even for a soap opera."
Inventing Anna,0,"Like Delvey herself, “Inventing Anna” is all flash with little substance — offering little insight into this enigmatic figure."
Inventing Anna,1,"While the focus of the series isnt always consistent, the story itself is fascinating. Garner plays her in a way that makes it impossible to look away when she is on screen."
Inventing Anna,1,"Thoroughly entertaining thanks to a wealth of Manhattan elites who fell for Delvey’s schtick, Inventing Anna proves an addictive, who-is-she? riff on the whodunit."
Inventing Anna,1,"Even with an occasionally clunky script, Inventing Anna is ridiculously watchable, aided in part by another scene-stealing performance from Julia Garner and a top-notch ensemble."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
Inventing Anna,1,I suppose it’s inevitable that a story about a phony heiress feels a little hollow… but it’s a fun ride while it lasts.
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
Inventing Anna,1,"Despite the lies and the fraud, Inventing Anna remains mostly light and even campy."
Inventing Anna,0,"The show misunderstands what made the grifter at its center a viral sensation; for all the promise in its ripped-from-the-headlines premise, Inventing Anna is a shabby letdown."
Inventing Anna,0,"The whole thing just does not work. It’s an over-stylised, overlong, over-acted and hilariously overblown soap opera."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
Inventing Anna,1,"There is a lot to like about this slick, intriguing storyline, it just could have been told in a more focused way."
Inventing Anna,1,"A series with a dynamite central character, insight, wit and schlocky charm."
Inventing Anna,1,"Ultimately, Garner’s committed performance adds a layer of complexity to Inventing Anna that might otherwise be absent."
Inventing Anna,0,"If Inventing Anna possesses any relevance at all, its due to the quality of its cast."
Inventing Anna,0,"Delvey’s story is riveting. The series, sadly, is not."
Inventing Anna,0,"The series is not nearly fun enough to justify its length, quality, or even existence."
Inventing Anna,1,"It may have more heft than it initially appears, but it is played essentially as a modern soap opera – and God, is it fun."
Inventing Anna,1,"A Binge-worthy series you will find once it has you, you too will be under Annas spell."
Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts."
Inventing Anna,1,"Garner is, not surprisingly, fully up to the difficult task of portraying a person with no center, both for laughs and for drama. She is compelling throughout."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna careens all over the place, and one of its only consistencies is an exhausting insistence that Delvey was talented but misunderstood."
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s a Sisyphean task to get us to care as much about the writing of an article as the escapades of the person being written about, and neither the series nor a surprisingly depthless Chlumsky succeeds in doing so."
Inventing Anna,1,"The series lacks a clear focus and has an inconsistent tone. Overall, I was rather disappointed, but the premise and a few standout performances make the series worth watching."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
Inventing Anna,0,"By the end, Inventing Anna may test your resolve as you decide how much time you choose to spend in the company of an unrepentant bossy narcissist, regardless of how well she’s played."
Inventing Anna,1,Shonda Rhimess first limited series for Netflix is a win for both her and the streamer. The series boasts an outstanding lead performance from Julia Garner as well as good to great performances from the entire supporting cast.
Inventing Anna,1,"Imagine a stitch, combining the investigative style of Law & Order with everything intrinsic to a Shondaland series, including the pivoting plotlines, messy humanity, and the nearly diabolical (its so clever) dialogue."
Inventing Anna,1,"Like too many streaming series, it trades in efficiency and force for length and reduced churn. Still, there’s a lot to chew on, including a handful of delicacies yet to be so earnestly unearthed in all those other stories of the rich and famous."
Inventing Anna,1,Inventing Anna is the perfect Shondaland series in that it is incredibly fun to watch but filled with issues.
Inventing Anna,1,"The modesty of its thematic and narrative ambitions keep Inventing Anna from being a great show. It could have been truly great if it had decided to really be about something, but instead it's content to just be fun."
Inventing Anna,1,"Even if I was hooked by Anna's story of artistry and deceit, I felt Shonda Rhimes new proposal could have used less runtime."
Inventing Anna,1,The series suffers from a few meandering detours but succeeds in its goal of elevating its central figure.
Inventing Anna,1,"A show all about superficial pizzazz, in which flashy aesthetics ripped from reality TV arent just surface texture. They're text and subtext too, appearing each time someone recalls when they were first lured in by Delvey's mysterious charm."
Inventing Anna,1,"The plot of Inventing Anna can feel a bit convoluted at times, but all the various jigsaw pieces of the story come together in a satisfying way by the end, albeit some more interesting and outrageous than others."
Inventing Anna,1,"Slick, shiny and enjoyably ridiculous entertainment - though I imagine that the people caught up in Delvey’s real-life racket might struggle to see the funny side."
Inventing Anna,0,"There is a brilliant drama to be had from the story of Anna Delvey, and when someone makes one I’ll be sure to let you know."
Inventing Anna,0,Inventing Anna feels like a ghost of a shadow of its central narrative. What’s left is a show that is so obsessed with the idea of its main character that it forgets to explore who that young woman is.
Inventing Anna,1,Part of the perversely entertaining allure of both Delvey and the series is being able to admire her epic gall while also being glad you’re not her.
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s an overly long muddle, never quite sure what it wants to say about its title character, or how to say it."
Inventing Anna,1,"At once, it manages to be a largely gripping recounting of the original scam, that will satisfy anyone who eagerly lapped up Pressler's feature, and a sophisticated dissection of a postmodern media event."
Inventing Anna,0,Ends up feeling like a show-length adaptation of a novelty T-shirt that reads ANNA DELVEY DID NOTHING WRONG in big block letters.
Inventing Anna,1,The series has all the hyper-competence and polish that one would expect from a Shondaland property.
Inventing Anna,1,Watch enough of the series and she’ll infect your brain; you’ll start reading sentences to yourself in Anna’s voice. You’ll get as obsessed with her as Vivian and those who knew Anna do.
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s too much that adds to too little. There is a compelling story to tell here, but “Inventing Anna” isn’t it."
Inventing Anna,1,"The results are occasionally messy and often unwieldy — most of its nine episodes clock in at over an hour each  — but they’re also savvy, sly and compulsively watchable."
Inventing Anna,1,"Even as the show around her stutters, Garner leans into her role with a vulpine, barely there grin that proves irresistible."
Inventing Anna,0,"Despite its more evocative performances, Inventing Anna demands patience that doesn’t pay off, squandering its promising potential along the way."
Inventing Anna,1,"A juicy, messy, series that is jam packed with drama, betrayal, manipulation, twists, turns, and surprises. One of those shows that will have viewers creating their own timelines and taking notes  doing everything they can to piece it all together."
Inventing Anna,1,"Inventing Anna is an engaging series, well made and revelatory, with great pacing, so hunker down for 10 hours of WTF moments."
The Pentaverate,1,"Mike Myers has returned to joke about poop, butts, farts and pee, but with the confidence and courage of someone who knows the ins and outs of comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Pentaverate,1,"The Pentaverate is a funny satire of secret societies and conspiracies [...] and a great return to form for Mike Myers who plays 8 characters, all with moments to shine, and never overpowering. Lydia West expresses wonderful comedic talent every episode."
The Pentaverate,0,Mike Myers' affectionate but uneven conspiracy theory comedy is let down by its lowbrow humour.
The Pentaverate,1,"The story is involved, but the plot is episodic and the comedy mostly genial, with puns, excessive accents and bodily function gags (lots of those). It’s nice to have Myers back, but this is at best a distraction."
The Pentaverate,0,"While I am glad I didn’t have to pay to see this on the big screen, I enjoyed laughing at some dumb jokes for a couple of hours."
The Pentaverate,0,"Although its fantastic to have Mike Myers back in action, the series is underwhelming in elaborating its premise and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
The Pentaverate,0,"It appears Myers learned nothing in the past 14 years, and The Pentaverate is as big a dud as he’s ever made."
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
The Pentaverate,0,"A less-than-stellar return to comedy for Mike Myers, featuring outdated jokes, an attempt at topicality that falls flat, and a waste of talented comedians."
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
The Pentaverate,0,"If you're not bowled over by the eight rubbery faces Myers cycle through its six episodes, maybe it's because they're only slightly removed from versions of his characters you've laughed with before but whose humor feels crustily outdated in 2022."
The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite."
The Pentaverate,1,"""The Pentaverate"" is simultaneously silly and pointless, and a welcome return to form for its star."
The Pentaverate,1,"There’s an undeniable thrill to watching Myers, still a comedy genius when he cares to be... throw himself into caricature after caricature of broken, insecure men."
The Pentaverate,0,'The Pentaverate' is unbelievably bad.
The Pentaverate,0,"Had The Pentaverate been made in 1997, it still might not have been much good, but it would have perhaps made more sense. I’ll give it this, mind – it’s nice."
The Pentaverate,0,"Underneath its mildly amusing, emotionally scattered exterior, The Pentaverate is a flawed but heartfelt ode to the importance of honesty in an era where lies are widespread and popularized."
The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough."
The Pentaverate,0,The Pentaverate struggles under the weight of its main talent.
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
The Pentaverate,1,"This is a Myers show, and it offers all the comfort and eye-rolling fatigue you’d expect from that, regardless of what year it is. That’s the resilience of juvenile humor: It never ages."
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
The Pentaverate,1,"For between 25 and 28 minutes at a time, it should take you out of yourself and into a world of mustard-robed elders, bum jokes and general daftness."
Outer Banks,1,I'm enjoying the camaraderie of the teens and their problem-solving in working towards a goal. Be prepared; it's ultra-drama.
Outer Banks,1,"The way it's all packaged together, however, makes it slick enough that it's irresistible to all ages. Don't feel guilty if you feel a little too old for this show before you begin, because that bonkers mystery will keep you clicking."
Outer Banks,1,"Maybe it's a show that's still trying too hard at points, but it's easy to imagine that fans of ""Outer Banks"" watching Season 2 will find much of what they're searching for."
Outer Banks,1,"It was a compelling beginning to the season, and the fact that Terrence, Stubs, and Cleo turned on them came out of nowhere."
Outer Banks,1,"One thing Outer Banks never fails to be is fun, and with a plot so far-reaching, this counts for a lot."
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
Outer Banks,1,"The real draw of Outer Banks is its sense of fun and outlandish adventure-like an older Goonies with more death-defying stakes attached. As someone once said, stupid things have positive outcomes all the time."
After Life,1,"It is by turns outrageous, uplifting, unflinching, sad, hilarious and angry."
After Life,1,"The end of this elevating, energizing series may cause confusion, but the conversation that follows ""After Life"" will add one more layer to Gervais' admirable foundation."
After Life,1,"Ultimately, it's worth sticking with, but you can't help feeling it would have worked better as a single 90-minute special."
After Life,1,The bitterness gives way to a refined dignity; it’s like watching an irreverent comedy confess that it was a coming-of-adage drama all along.
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
After Life,1,After Life remains a cleverly constructed dark comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
After Life,0,"Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like Ted Lasso."
After Life,0,"Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
After Life,1,"A great closing for the story, highlighting above all its unbeatable ending. [Full review in Spanish]"
After Life,0,"Its themes have become repetitive to the point where ""Life"" has clearly run its course."
After Life,1,"Season three provides a sweet and satisfying finale to a near-perfect series that warms the heart, challenges perceptions, confronts demons and, yes, makes you laugh out loud."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"A well-structured, complex, attractive story. [Full review in Spanish]"
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
Behind Her Eyes,1,Whiplash twists and turns make this a worthy watch as this uncomfortable trio enters new territory.
Behind Her Eyes,1,"Seductive and compelling, this mystery series boasts interesting characters, expertly doled out twists, and lots of intrigue."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"Good cast, good story but it all just takes too long to tell."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"I admire, for its sheer, nasty audacity, the double twist that ends the story. To achieve its impact, though, the limited series requires you not merely to suspend your disbelief, but strap it to a rocket and send it to the Milky Way."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The show's insistence on progressing towards that bonkers twist, however, results in it sacrificing storytelling in favour of shock. Not only is it frustrating on its own, it's detrimental to the writing..."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"It is hard to tell who is warden and who is prisoner, who is crazy and who is sane, and the Netflix show revels in this uncertainty."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"If you're in the mood to crack open a bottle of wine, enjoy some steamy sex, and get your mind blown in one of the silliest ways possible, it's a highly entertaining ride."
Behind Her Eyes,0,An engagingly jagged and creepy revenge thriller that degenerates into a steaming pile of paranormal malarkey.
Behind Her Eyes,1,"A little trite, but nicely done and ever watchable."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Your time would be better spent reading a book. Just not the book this train wreck of a drama this based on.
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The mad, chaotic energy of Behind Her Eyes feels almost like a practical joke, the kind of prank you'd expect to end with an epilogue featuring a drunk Ashton Kutcher explaining that this, in fact, a simulation."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The last stretch is as surprising as ridiculous, but spending time with these characters is a lot of fun. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Behind Her Eyes,1,We're hoping that the mysteries in Behind Her Eyes won't disappoint.
Behind Her Eyes,1,It's weird! It's nuts! You could do worse with yet another aggressively indoor weekend!
Behind Her Eyes,1,"It is probably intended to make you want to go back and watch the whole series again with fresh eyes (remember the title?). The only problem is, the run up is so ponderous you might not even make it as far as the twist in the first place."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Ultimately, Behind Her Eyes has a lot of style to offer, but not much substance."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"In its favor it is beautifully made, tonally distinct and exceptionally well-acted. It is gripping and slightly sinister from almost the start and fueled by an off-kilter erotic charge."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Behind Her Eyes just doesn't know what it wants to be and takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a muddled mess that could - and should - have been cut short."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Behind Her Eyes is just too ridiculous to take even half as seriously as the show takes itself.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The buildup works well, but many will question the unexpected ending. Regardless, the journey proves to be intriguing."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Anything beneath the surface in Behind Her Eyes is irrelevant by the end.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
Behind Her Eyes,1,"This was something I personally enjoyed, as it felt like a new twist on a fairly well-worn theme - but I can also see how it might be off-putting to some viewers."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"By the time it's over, this sci-fi-tinged limited series becomes a buzzworthy binge, one that will likely have you thinking back to clues you might have missed along the way."
Behind Her Eyes,1,You'll either love or hate the big reveal.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"It's also not a particularly sexy show, despite sex scenes a plenty. David and Louise's illicit trysts lack chemistry and, while Hewson smoulders entertainingly as Adele... her emotions never properly explode."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"""Behind Her Eyes"" isn't about people, really. It's about #WTFThatEnding. I liked the journey more than the destination, but then, I don't skate."
Behind Her Eyes,1,There's certainly enough of a draw and not too much of a commitment to at least make taking the plunge worth the effort.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Although it retains the book's shocking twist (it was marketed with its own hashtag #WTFThatEnding), even that is not enough to give Behind Her Eyes an edge over its umpteen counterparts."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"A fantastically entertaining magic trick of a TV show, so confident in its incongruous genre mashup that you won't be able to look away."
Behind Her Eyes,1,The ultimate question is - Are the six chapters worth the twist? And the answer is a resounding yes.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"It's creepy and engaging throughout the early chapters. But then? Well... then, Behind Her Eyes becomes a different kind of story altogether, and a much sillier one."
Behind Her Eyes,1,"The six-part series, created by Steve Lightfoot, does what it does very well, as long as it remains rooted in the human."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"When you start dreaming about chess after watching a single episode, you'll know you're hooked."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Anya Taylor-Joy is absolutely impressive in a show that glows with trust in the filmmaking process. A story around self-stimulation, power of mind, adversities, forgetting what's written and the danger of the uncontrolled. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Queen's Gambit,0,A glamorous Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't show the true cost of addiction - but rather a rose-tinted view of womanhood and paint-by-numbers redemption.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"While the chess matches themselves were exhilarating to witness-yes, they really were-it was the relationships Beth forms throughout the series that truly gave this stunning period piece unexpected soul."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The absence of villains, especially for an American show portraying Cold War era Russians, complements the dignity of the show."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Chess may be the central subject of this spectacular Netflix series, but make no mistake in thinking that The Queen's Gambit is solely about this game of strategy. It's about so much more."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"An empowering tale about a female chess prodigy that, thankfully for amateurs, does not get bogged down in fine details and is still satisfying to those who do know the game."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"...an instant classic, as meaningful to the literate over-thinker as to casual audiences, and exactly the kind of original project that rarely seemed to find purchase in cinema over the last few decades..."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Jury's out, but it's one of the best series of the year, I would definitely say so. Well-crafted and directed."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Not the best series Iv'e ever seen, but it's really up there. Well-crafted and fun."
The Queen's Gambit,1,It may be a surprise that a show about chess has become one of Netflix's most-streamed shows of the past couple of weeks. But it shouldn't be -- not when it is filled with standout performances and its chess competitions play out like boxing matches.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Raise your hand if you anticipated a coming-of-age, period-piece drama about a female chess prodigy in the 1950s and 1960s becoming perhaps the most addictive and binge-worthy series of 2020."
The Queen's Gambit,1,Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't make a single false move in The Queen's Gambit.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Written and directed by Scott Frank, an Oscar nominee for his ""Logan"" script, ""Queen's"" is electrifying. Frank's direction is full of quick cuts, artful framing and beautiful shots."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Yes, this is a series about a chess player, but it is more about her journey there and the heavy and deep emotions that take you through the path is what makes this a must-watch."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's a terrific, emotionally intelligent hour of television - one that refuses to distinguish between the cost of sporting immortality and the price of human history."
The Queen's Gambit,1,One of its strengths is knowing when to leave a good thing alone - much of the dialogue is word-for-word what Tevis wrote.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"""Alma's not pathetic, she's just stuck,"" says Beth about her adopted mother. I can't think of a better way to summarize this unfortunately arrested miniseries."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The series also succeeds in making the cerebral game of chess come alive even for viewers who don't know a rook from a pawn.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's a performance that really grabs the viewer's attention, and which elevates The Queen's Gambit from a reasonable drama series to a truly engaging piece of television."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is clearly not a cheap production. Every scene is eye-pleasing, a feast of color and pattern, fashion and scenery."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's so natural it's easy to overlook, but growing up onscreen is hard, precise work, and this young talent makes it look easy."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The results aren't ""important,"" or ""improving."" They're just pretty irresistible."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"What makes ""The Queen's Gambit"" so satisfying comes in large measure from the character Taylor-Joy brings to screen: a charming, elegant weirdo who delivers her lines with a cool, wintergreen snap, and never really reacts the way one might expect."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A stunning adaptation of Walter Tevis' novel, starring Anya Taylor-Joy as a chess prodigy who thrives in a system designed to keep her down..."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A sublime little seven-episode sitter, with no room for sequels, which throughout managed to be tense without melodramatic, yearning without cloying, popular without pandering."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is the rare show that is as smart as advertised, and even more engaging."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The distraction of her beauty aside, Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing, well supported by director-actor Marielle Heller as the woman who adopts Beth but has her own demons to fight..."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"While it is frustrating to see Black characters still reduced to stereotypes in what has been the supposed golden age for Black roles and representation in television, it's not all that surprising."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"You don't have to care about chess to enjoy The Queen's Gambit-though the chess matches are enthralling even for the uninitiated-because the series is stylish, entertaining, and engrossing."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance, portraying a young female pro-chess prodigy. One of the best series I have seen on Netflix"
The Queen's Gambit,1,Young female chess prodigy struggles with drink and drugs.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Taylor-Joy spreads a kind of energy field around her, which is the real momentum of the series. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Part addiction drama, part rags to riches story just teeters on the edge of intrigue with solid all-round performances, but at times it felt a bit too stretched out to fully achieve a checkmate."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is undeniably sentimental, but I would argue that it's the various ways it holds back that makes it so effective."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Taylor-Joy makes you fascinated by the character without being sure you exactly like her, or necessarily approve of her actions..."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit probably could have wrapped in six episodes, but when a show's world is rendered so beautifully, you won't mind a little extra time to look around."
The Queen's Gambit,1,A compelling coming-of-age story that also explores how substance abuse has become such a killer in western society.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"...all the rage now, and deservedly so..."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"That Beth's exquisite, porcelain features remain so remarkably untouched by the scourge of alcohol and drug abuse is one of the few flaws in an otherwise fabulously entertaining tale of how an orphaned girl found herself through the mastery of chess."
The Queen's Gambit,1,Queen's Gambit has become the rarest of things in the modern age: a watercooler show that has more than a 72-hour shelf life.
The Queen's Gambit,1,One of the things i love about this miniseries is it's not just a peek behind the curtain. You really feel like you have a backstage pass into this world of competitive chess play.
The Queen's Gambit,1,Scott Frank varies the progression to the thrilling end with just enough flashbacks in the plot.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"There's never really any doubt of the outcome in this glossy, moving, and fabulously enthralling fantasy, in which Beth seems able to turn her addictions on and off almost at will."
The Queen's Gambit,1,Scott Frank made an entertaining film. But its heart and soul come from Walter Tevis.
The Queen's Gambit,1,Anna Taylor-Joy is a joy to behold as the prodigy chess player. The series could have been shortened but the overall effect is solid entertainment.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Even if you don't know your knight from your bishop it's thrilling, while the naturalistic script flows beautifully. Most satisfyingly, every time you think it's going to fall back on some awful 'woman in a man's world' trope, it just doesn't."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's perfectly good, very watchable, and fills in the blank spot that The Crown has left in its absence."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A story that addresses all of its issues with depth, consideration, and elegance. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Queen's Gambit,1,More female led television series like this one please!
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The fact that you are constantly surprised by The Queen's Gambit's refusal to fall for trite, well-trodden tropes makes it more surprising that this is a work of fiction."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Taylor-Joy delivers a screen acting masterpiece, as she expresses flickers of emotion with a faint widening of an eye, a miniscule tilt of the head or a twitch of the lips. Terrific."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is a drama peppered with elegance both in terms of cinematography, music and performance."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Chess is not just a contest on the board, but a contest within Beth's mind: between her insatiable appetite for winning and her compulsive urge for self-sabotage."
The Queen's Gambit,1,An intriguing exploration into the emotional price paid for genius.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Young Beth Harmon (played equally brilliantly by Isla Johnston as a child and Anya Taylor-Joy as a teenager and adult) is a poor waif living in a Kentucky orphanage... Bright lights beckon, as do darker things. Captivating."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The miniseries is at its most affecting in what goes on between the matches. This is where (creator Scott Frank) showcases Beth becoming a well-rounded woman, not just a resounding victor."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The Queen's Gambit is quietly terrific.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's unsubtle, obvious, on-the-nose. But it's also compelling. Taylor-Joy is endlessly watchable, and the casting is really fun: every character has a fascinating face. And then there's the chess, treated seriously, with integrity, with respect."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It has the heft and depth of a great novel, going deeper and deeper into the main character and probing her soul with an outsider's keen, curious eyes."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"We learn about Sicilian defences and doubled pawns; about adjournments and endgames. But at no point is the show inaccessible. This is a remarkable achievement. It moves elegantly and enthrallingly, without ever alienating its audience."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Holding everything together is Taylor-Joy's mesmerizing, perplexing, elusive performance. The wonder here is that by the time it's over we feel we at last understand this young woman who may be incapable of fully understanding herself."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The show's emotional anchor is its love story between the eccentric kid and the orphanage janitor... No intergenerational relationship on-screen this year can match the warm tears they'll make you shed.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit has flaws. It's maybe a little too long... But The Queen's Gambit also has a healthy dose of Happy-Go-Lucky-ness at its core, in a way that almost makes it a mirror image of that film."
The Queen's Gambit,1,Creators Scott Frank and Allan Scott have managed the impossible here. They have succeeded in turning a story about one of the most docile and unglamorous sports into something truly magical and outstanding.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is addictive, entertaining, and ultimately hugely satisfying. There aren't a lot of layers to The Queen's Gambit, and as addiction dramas go, it's barely surface deep."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"With excellent pacing and a sure sense of itself out of the gate, The Queen's Gambit is a work of art-riveting, radiant, and simply spellbinding. Like Beth, it triumphs through its devotion to a love of the game."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The series itself is beautifully shot, with lush cinematography and a high production value that makes each episode feel cinematic."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"This will certainly fill the Mad Men-shaped hole in your life, even if only briefly. Taylor-Joy is one of the most compelling young actresses working today and Marielle Heller is a revelation."
The Queen's Gambit,1,A simply mesmerising performance (only tantalisingly glimpsed at in episode one) from Taylor-Joy.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It is a transporting tale of an extraordinary life and a window onto a world of addiction and empowerment, pawns and queens."
The Queen's Gambit,1,An intelligent and personal period piece.
The Queen's Gambit,1,This is an intricately constructed story that moves as deliberately as pieces on a chessboard and yet it plays on the screen as effortlessly as the characters play the game. The Queen's Gambit is a must-see.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Opens up a world that feels inscrutable at times, told through the eyes of a prodigy who embraces her genius, but is as human as the rest of us."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"There's a set of the jaw, a mercenary narrowing of the eyes in Anya Taylor-Joy that hisses ""relentless."""
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit has almost everything one could ask for in a dramatic miniseries. It's intimate yet cinematic, delicate and fierce, and brisk but reflective."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The budding star at the center of Scott Frank's new Netflix series has a rare magnetism, the kind that can sell even the most esoteric of subjects."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Even at its most contrived, The Queen's Gambit never slows down enough to bore you."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Nothing in The Queen's Gambit feels haphazard, with Meizler filling every frame with period detail. Uli Hanisch's production design evokes both the suburban tackiness and growing luxury of Beth's ascension with equal ease."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Just as you feel a familiar dynamic forming, in which a talented woman ends up intimidating her suitors, The Queen's Gambit swerves; it's probably no coincidence that a story about chess thrives on confounding audience expectations."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is still largely satisfying anyway, as a handsome-looking period piece, another showcase for Taylor-Joy's talents (and her eyes), and a consideration of anxiety, unprocessed trauma, and how both can so easily conspire to drive a genius."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Whatever quibbles I detail here in the name of thoroughness, I was involved from beginning to end; there are chess games and human games, and I was alert to Beth's losses and wins, in both respects, in an actual bodily way."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Unlike chess, The Queen's Gambit is slightly less than the sum of its parts, but you will have a great deal of fun watching them at work."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"A lightly sad, wholesomely cynical, romantically sinister series with a competent, charismatic, world champion as its lead... A rock star with perfect hair and a killer game. We loved every minute of it."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"""The Queen's Gambit"" makes all kinds of unexpected moves."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's stylish, eerie and uneven and seems stretched at seven episodes."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Anchored by a magnetic lead performance and bolstered by world-class acting, marvelous visual language, a teleplay that's never less than gripping, and an admirable willingness to embrace contradiction and ambiguity, it's one of the year's best series."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit is watchable, but lacks the kind of genuine mystery that would elevate the material beyond that middling bar. It's better than a draw, but not much more."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Taylor-Joy excels in the quiet moments, her eyelids narrowing as she decimates an opponent, her whole body physicalizing angry desperation when the game turns against her."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The Queen's Gambit is a remarkably intense bingewatch.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"If it doesn't win you over, ""Gambit"" will at least play you to a draw."
The Queen's Gambit,1,This is the sort of delicate prestige television that Netflix should be producing more often. It's smart and gentle and tastefully assured in the worthiness of its subject.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The tale of a troubled chess prodigy, Taylor-Joy's magnetic presence is enough reason to watch this handsome Netflix limited series, even if the seven-part production gets dragged out about three episodes too long."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Scott Frank's latest limited series, The Queen's Gambit, is an intelligent, anxious, detail oriented character study that's a perfect reflection of the game at its centre."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"With its strong themes and understanding of the times, this is a must-see drama this year. This series serves a checkmate in its opening chapters."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Ms. Taylor-Joy is really the beginning and endgame of The Queen's Gambit, and gives a performance that is as precisely physical as it is emotional."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"The Queen's Gambit manages to personalize the game and its players thanks to clever storytelling and, in Anya Taylor-Joy, a lead actor so magnetic that when she stares down the camera lens, her flinty glare threatens to cut right through it."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"It's a unique sports film that examines feminism while also touching on ominous Cold War politics. ""The Queen's Gambit"" is one of the most intelligent and engaging Netflix series presently on the streaming platform."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"An aesthetically beautiful project with several superb performances, all in service to a story that starts to feel padded long before the end comes."
The Queen's Gambit,1,The Queen's Gambit is a visual character study thanks to its period setting and nifty cinematography.
The Queen's Gambit,1,"When coupled with its earnest and talented cast and its lush and stunning aesthetics, The Queen's Gambit is easily one of the strongest binge-worthy shows of the fall season."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"With a performance at the center that never falters, and rich storytelling, this is one of the most consistently entertaining and impressive shows of 2020."
The Queen's Gambit,1,It's a rare series that can accurately render a particular form of genius without alienating the viewers who will always be the spectators.
Alias Grace,1,"In the show's best moments, it's about something darker and more complicated; about how there's things we'll do for the sake of ourselves and things we'll do for the sake of those we love, but when both are on the table, dangerous doors swing open."
Alias Grace,1,The real power of the book and the Netflix series lies in the exploration of what it means to be a woman under the patriarchy.
Alias Grace,1,"Although it may not have so much visual strength, there are some quite inspired moments that help 'Alias Grace' to be a jewel that deserves to be discovered. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Alias Grace,1,Sarah Polley's script makes for a thrilling domestic mystery.
Alias Grace,1,"It's ultimately a testament to the level of mystery surrounding Grace Marks and the murders for which she is imprisoned, a mystery that remains even today."
Alias Grace,1,It's a fantastic cast and is very well written... I was very intrigued right from the start.
Alias Grace,1,"The series is a jewel: a harsh story, that of a life mistreated from birth by the mere fact of being a woman, treated with subtlety and elegance and always away from the ravenous stimulus of the most elementary morbid... [Full Review in Spanish]"
Alias Grace,1,"The series, whose duration invites to be devoured in one sitting, plays with the unreliable narrator to keep the viewer constantly alert and reconfiguring the puzzle of the story as presented by the protagonist. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Alias Grace,1,"What the TV series does exceptionally well is paint this authentic world of masters and servants, and show, to quote Grace, how one person is rewarded and another punished for the same sin."
Alias Grace,1,Grace is being pushed towards an edge; now it's just a matter of how she'll tumble over it.
Alias Grace,1,"It's good, and worth watching; it just doesn't feel as essential as Handmaid's does."
Alias Grace,1,"Seen in full, and judged not as a conventional crime drama, but rather as a psychological character study, Alias Grace is a rousing success."
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace is a savagely political tale, dressed up in modest aprons and bonnets for the period drama crowd."
Alias Grace,1,"That's the ultimate appeal of Alias Grace: the subdued, no-shit narrative approach to Grace's story, and Gadon's performance of quiet strength."
Alias Grace,1,"Margaret Atwood's heroines don't own their sexuality. With Alias Grace following The Handmaid's Tale, the revolution is being televised."
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace is a solid, well-made piece of television that doesn't hide its intelligence under a bonnet, as costume dramas can do. Nor does it attempt to keep your attention with soap opera style cliff-hangers."
Alias Grace,1,"[Sarah] Gadon is extraordinary as the chameleon-like Grace, who seems at once naive and canny, calculating yet open-hearted, traditional but rebellious."
Alias Grace,1,"A haunting, subtle performance from Sarah Gadon."
Alias Grace,1,"Through Sarah Polley's rhythmic writing and Mary Harron's moody visuals, Margaret Atwood's beautiful prose has been translated to moving poetry in this engrossing series."
Alias Grace,1,"But in Alias Grace, there's an even more galvanizing heroine for our time. Of course the system is rigged against us, Grace says, so don't try to bring it down. Use it to our own ends."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace is a remarkable story.
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace is smarter and better than Handmaid's Tale, though subtler and slower."
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace is a beautiful piece of work. Its every detail is rewarding in a way that's rare for television these days, especially on streaming platforms. On top of that, it's a narrative about women, made by women"
Alias Grace,1,"... Alias Grace is discomfiting, compelling, deeply insightful television."
Alias Grace,1,"It is a beautifully shot and well-written story that does amazing work with few sets, makes the most of its talented cast, and has no filler or dragging."
Alias Grace,1,"This is an important work that has, as its thematic root, a reality in which half of the world's population have many reasons to fear the other half. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
Alias Grace,1,Gadon's wily performance strikes the right note between the knowing connivance of a remorseless killer and a space alien's innocence about humans and their inscrutable hang-ups.
Alias Grace,1,True story of a murder is another dark Atwood dystopia.
Alias Grace,1,Producer Sarah Polley's masterful writing transforms a brilliant novel into a captivating television experience.
Alias Grace,1,"... a historical cautionary tale about gender, class, and identity, it's is a solid entry in a rather cluttered genre."
Alias Grace,1,Superb.
Alias Grace,1,"Paquin plays the part beautifully, not just the death scenes but the slow-building deterioration of her relationship with Grace, bitter rivalry twisting a superficially pleasant connection into an emotionally explosive situation."
Alias Grace,1,"I defy anyone to end this series not a little in love with Gadon's Grace, be she murderess or not."
Alias Grace,1,"Harron has found an original cinematic language to convey Grace's memories, a dreamlike narrative propulsion that carries us along."
Alias Grace,1,"I find it impossible to escape the thought that perhaps Alias Grace is functioning exactly as intended, and that I, a straight white man, am never quite going to understand the depths of oppression forced upon Grace Marks in any way other than academic."
Alias Grace,1,"Part of the show's power lies in the understanding that although we don't know the truth about Grace's past, she's a likeable character. Seeing the trauma she's endured only makes me want to root for her more."
Alias Grace,1,"I suspect that every viewer will agree upon one particular verdict -- television, in adapting the novels of Margaret Atwood, now has a record of 2 for 2."
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace can be as light-hearted and pleasant a story as it is a probing, surreal and melodramatic character study."
Alias Grace,1,As powerful and subtle a performance from Sarah Gadon as Grace as you could wish. Blessed be this Atwoodian fruit too.
Alias Grace,1,It's fairly soon clear that this is script-writing captivated by its own ambiguity-a condition in no danger of being infectious to huge numbers of the film's viewers.
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace blossoms into something beyond a tale of murder.
Alias Grace,1,"If violence is inevitable, Alias Grace argues, it may as well be a woman's uprising."
Alias Grace,1,"Viewers drawn to quiet, thoughtful character stories and a largely unknown story from women's history may find Alias Grace engaging enough."
Alias Grace,1,"Polley has captured the novel's essential strangeness and also applied rigour to the world of a 19th-century drudge. When you watch Sarah Gadon's Grace knead dough, you see the perspiration on her brow, the rawness of her over-worked hands."
Alias Grace,1,"Don't let the contemplative pace throw you off - Alias Grace is a thoughtful slow burn with a sense of humor and a clear perspective, in spite of the ambiguity it trades in."
Alias Grace,1,"The show is visually opulent and moves like a panther, with performances so elegant and instinctive that you almost don't notice how fast it's going."
Alias Grace,1,"If Mindhunter and The Handmaid's Tale had a baby, and covered that baby in solely 1800s-ready petticoats and bonnets, you would get Alias Grace."
Alias Grace,1,"[Sarah] Polley is the ideal translator of Atwood's material, a filmmaker obsessed with circling the truth over and over, even when there are no clear answers."
Alias Grace,1,"The actress Sarah Gadon does more, in this minute-or-so-long-shot, as many prestige-TV stars do in a season. And that's only the beginning."
Alias Grace,1,The performances are uniformly first-rate...
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace is a gripping, haunting series that, while not dealing with ghosts or the paranormal, definitely contains a looming specter."
Alias Grace,1,"What makes Alias Grace so compelling is Grace herself, and the way her complicated life speaks to how murky the truth can become when bias, skepticism, and basic human instinct get twisted up in knots that can't be untangled."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace is a story about storytelling -- one character compares Grace with Scheherazade -- which makes Ms. Gadon essential to its success. She is mesmerizing.
Alias Grace,1,"Having bounced around for years as a possible feature, Alias Grace proves better suited to this more expansive and leisurely adaptation."
Alias Grace,1,"The ambiguities of Alias Grace are among its greatest strengths, and they're handled with remarkable finesse by director Mary Harron and her top-flight cast."
Alias Grace,1,"A heady brew, despite its flaws."
Alias Grace,1,It plays with viewers' expectations about PBS Masterpiece-style television.
Alias Grace,1,[Sarah] Gadon gives a fascinating riddle of a performance.
Alias Grace,1,"It's so heavy throughout the first installment, you might wish for at least one of the characters to open a parlor window and let in some air, but as the story progresses it becomes too engrossing to turn away."
Alias Grace,1,"Grace's first-person narration, which hews closely to Atwood's own language, is sometimes addressed to the doctor and sometimes to us, the audience: We're her marks too, captivated, but with no clarity."
Alias Grace,0,"It's mostly restrained and respectable, with modest production values and uneven performances."
Alias Grace,1,Writer Polley and director Harron defiantly pull apart the male gaze and patriarchy through an unpredictable female protagonist.
Alias Grace,1,"Alias Grace unites sumptuous production values, a terrific, eclectic cast (that includes veteran Canadian director David Cronenberg and Atwood herself) and a tantalising narrative to create binge-worthy viewing."
Alias Grace,1,"It feels right that The Handmaid's Tale and Alias Grace both aired in this, the year of Trump. The former shows what could happen to women. The latter shows what did."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace largely proves that Atwood's ideas don't need extension or even fantasy to break through to viewers. They're powerful enough to stand on their own.
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace tells a complete and satisfying story that both calls attention to and satiates our desire for the gory details we crave from such a story.
Alias Grace,1,"This is not a cut and dry crime drama, but when the final credits roll, one thing is for certain: you will know exactly who Grace Marks is."
Alias Grace,1,"[Sarah] Gadon's performance is remarkable and the direction of Mary Harron (""I Shot Andy Warhol"") improves it further still: In tight focus, her eyes betray nothing, or rather betray no one."
Alias Grace,1,"The creators of this remarkable series are also, notably, all women."
Alias Grace,1,"It's not Gilead, but since when do women need a dystopian Puritan society to be downtrodden?"
Alias Grace,1,...an electric six episodes driven by the pursuit of truth and a hell of a main character...
Alias Grace,1,The series suggests that image is the sole source of agency for Victorian women.
Alias Grace,1,"The real attraction is the performances, particularly [Sarah] Gadon's."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace is a remarkably complex portrayal of a young servant girl...
Alias Grace,1,"Gabon is superb as a woman whose meekness seems to contain rolling oceans of emotions. The deeper you get into the series, the more her performance seems almost hypnotic."
Alias Grace,1,"The most remarkable thing about Alias Grace may not even be its content, though that's quite extraordinary, but that it's the second time in six months that Canadian author Margaret Atwood ... has had one of her books adapted into a miniseries."
Alias Grace,1,Alias Grace doesn't strike the zeitgeist in the way The Handmaid's Tale did; this is historical fiction rather than a dystopian alternative future.
Alias Grace,1,The story comes to the viewer in complex chunks and unsettling layers... Innocent or guilty? There's much more to it than that.
Alias Grace,1,"In most of the ways that matter, Netflix's Alias Grace presents an adaptation that delivers the gothic horror, social commentary, and domestic investigation of the novel."
Alias Grace,1,Gadon is the engine that drives it and there is a stiffness to the six-part adaptation of the type which tends to bedevil a good deal of Canadian TV drama.
Alias Grace,1,"The hook may be a murder, but it's more interestingly examined as a story about storytelling and for the contributions of Polley, Harron and Gadon."
Alias Grace,1,"Sarah Gadon's exhilarating performance inhabits and subverts all the extreme adjectives thrown Grace's way, leaving you with a memorable character whose lingering unknowability is her greatest strength."
Archive 81,1,"It's mixed messages, crossed wires and a tightly woven emotional fabric make this imperfect adaptation a worthy addition to Netflixs original series and its horror catalog."
Archive 81,1,Archive 81 manages to overcome a slow start and build momentum until you’re just as sucked into this strange new world as Dan is.
Archive 81,1,"Despite never descending into full horror, Archive 81 remains unsettling. It is one rare horror TV series that makes excellent use of its already intriguing premise and ideas."
Archive 81,0,"At eight episodes it's way too long. And though they're attractive, the two leads are not much more than serviceable in the acting department."
Archive 81,0,Is Archive 81 the silliest show on telly? Probably not -- but it certainly comes close.
Archive 81,1,A slow burn rather than a carnival ride of scares.
Archive 81,1,"Jump-scares and quick hits of horror come from those elements, but the most unnerving parts of the series hinge on the deep dread of isolation."
Archive 81,1,"Video is alluring as a medium. And in Netflix's mystery series Archive 81, it takes on a power as mysterious and majestic as Cthulhu."
Archive 81,1,"Though there are some clear limitations built into the production, like its minimal effort to distinguish between the two time periods the action takes place in, the mystery itself is intriguing."
Archive 81,1,"Archive 81 is well balanced, with satisfying emotional arcs and horror/mystery elements for the viewer to pour over."

Archive 81,1,The first binge-worthy horror series of 2022.
Archive 81,0,"The final product exists more as a collection of ideas. As new wrinkles each raise a handful of fresh possibilities, Archive 81 rarely settles on how or where to best focus its attention."
Archive 81,1,"Archive 81, the Netflix series ""loosely inspired"" by the podcast of the same name, is a worthy addition to the catalog, a mix of media, messages, storylines, timelines and psychologies."
Archive 81,1,"While it takes its time (too much so in the middle episodes), those in charge of the adaptation invest fully in the key characters. Result: We actually give a damn about their fates."

Archive 81,1,This anxiety-inducing series continues to build on the mystery in a way that keeps you wanting more.
Archive 81,1,It's creepy and has that view to the past. It perfectly handles the concept of found footage.
Archive 81,1,"We're still wondering if Archive 81 can effectively put its timelines together into a coherent thriller. But it's off to a promising start, due to good performances from both Athie and Shihabi."
Archive 81,1,"Those eager for quick answers won't find them, but the eight episodes plant enough bizarre seeds to effectively pull audiences through its fun-house mirror."
Archive 81,1,"The slow-building, addictive hour-long drama is smarter than your average ghoul fest."

All of Us Are Dead,0,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"This stunning Korean series shows that it’s still possible to make compelling, imaginative, thought-provoking and hugely entertaining zombie splatter more than a decade after The Walking Dead spawned an unending genre glut."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"All Of Us Are Dead takes this formula and executes it flawlessly, in a slow-burn 12-episode odyssey about survival instinct and survivor’s guilt, the hope that pushes us forward and the grief that holds us back."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"Any new zombie-themed show must work hard to step out of The Walking Dead’s long shadow. Fortunately, All of Us Are Dead... pulls it off with a simple trick: It’s not so damn mean."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"This 12-part South Korean Netflix series about zombies invading a high school is gruesome, thrilling, and highly addictive."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"The series overcomes some cliches with a relentless pace and stylized action that make it fun to watch, even when it all seems a little familiar."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"It's not the lightest weekend binge, but All of Us Are Dead is an immensely satisfying, blood-soaked rollercoaster. Just don't eat while you watch it."
All of Us Are Dead,1,All of Us Are Dead does a fantastic job of introducing a large core cast and establishing a lot of characters as distinct personalities.
All of Us Are Dead,1,"The series is not really elevated and, at 12 hours, is way too long. If you’re addicted to variations on the zombie apocalypse, you will enjoy the South Korean riff on a familiar format. It isn’t Squid Game, though. Far from it."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"We are here for the zombie-filled madness and relentless violence, and this series delivers. It could easily be trimmed down, but it is so entertaining."
All of Us Are Dead,0,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.
All of Us Are Dead,0,This is a show for teenagers (despite some rather shocking language) so there's not much for us O.G. horror fans to enjoy.
All of Us Are Dead,0,"The series ultimately bites off more than it can chew in themes, characters, and ambition."
All of Us Are Dead,1,ALL OF US ARE DEAD is a complex and humanistic creation that is thoroughly entertaining and fits in well with the K- zombie genre.

All of Us Are Dead,1,"All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"Like Squid Game before it, All of Us Are Dead makes the most out of its nightmarish central location to otherworldly, dizzying effect."
All of Us Are Dead,1,Emotional resonance is what ultimately sets All of Us Are Dead apart from other zombie shows of its ilk.
All of Us Are Dead,1,"The implication is clear - that even as the virus spreads beyond the boundaries of the school and into the wider world, it's the result of festering ills and systemic injustices that have seeped from the top down. The rot is everywhere."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"Paced like a bullet and emotionally resonant when it needs to be, Netflix's new Korean zombie show makes for an immensely bingeable 12 hours of TV."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"All of Us Are Dead distinguishes its focus. This, combined with the drama-filled high school setting, helps the show carve out its own space in the crowded zombie pantheon."
All of Us Are Dead,1,"""All of Us Are Dead"" is nothing if not self-aware. It's also quite well executed, even when it feels more like an exercise than an organic creation."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Unlike the original Vikings, there is more action and battle here than intimacy and mysticism. [Full review in Spanish]"
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Valhalla is a blood-soaked bunch of silly fun, chock-full of risible dialogue, all of the daftest tropes of historical adventures..."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"With Vikings: Valhalla having already completed production on season two, you can rest assured you will at least get to find out what happens to these characters for one more season."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Valhallas biography and butchery is good enough to hold the interest of folks who dont mind more fiction than facts in their historical dramas, and prefer bloody beatdowns, bodice rippings and unwashed romps to accuracy or reality."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"If youre just here to up the historical combat quotient in your screen diet, have at it. But dont expect much else."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Valhalla might not grab you right out of the gate, but weather its growing pains and the gods just might reward you with a worthy successor to its popular predecessor."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Valhalla is promising, offering an exciting new batch of characters, but it needs to fix its pacing issue and lean into more of its strengths rather than trying to retread the path of history."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,It’s not the type of drama that you can have on in the background or while scrolling on your phone: it is complex as TV can be.
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"One beard only has to look at another beard and that’s it, throat slit. This has, in short, not been approached with any wit or humour or cleverness."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"For a bit of good, honest, dumb-as-hell, hairy-bros-with-axes action, I can wholeheartedly recommend Vikings: Valhalla."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,“Valhalla” hits the spot for a testosterone-pumped warlord adventure.
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Just like its parent show, Vikings: Valhalla is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. But for fans of the genre, Valhalla does a good job of continuing the story established in Vikings."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Sailing from History channel to Netflix, Vikings: Valhalla should be an even bigger attraction, charting a new chapter set more than a century after the original, while offering most of the same lusty charms."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Vikings: Valhalla brings more story to the table than its predecessor, and while it may often feel like too much, the action-filled moments are excellent and handled with ease."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"The show can sometimes feel like a montage of strapping, bearded men introducing themselves to each other... But “Valhalla” also demonstrates enough ambition and handle on its characters and pivotal time period to justify diving into its world."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,Netflix has such confidence in Jeb Stuart’s reboot that they’ve ordered three seasons already. Easy to understand why after watching these eight bingeable episodes.
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"It’s fun, no more, no less. Bit of history, bit of gore, bit of sex, bit of plot, lots of hair."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Even if Valhalla never quite reaches the heights of the Vikings mothership, the show it settles into becoming is pretty strong and satisfying on its own."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,Vikings: Valhalla is a crisp and often very entertaining re-skinning of the Vikings franchise that could use a little more of Vikings’ often messy ambition.
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Like its predecessor, Valhalla is a beautiful show, dark and gloomy and vicious, with all the adornments of warfare that make the Vikings so fascinating in the first place."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,Vikings stays consistently entertaining even as it fails some of its best ideas.
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"The saga’s connections to epochal events and people are so fascinating and cleverly worked, it’ll be extra rewarding to watch it with your Wikipedia open."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Vikings: Valhalla lacks the nuance required to be a truly great series, but its strong battle sequences, world-building, and magnetic characters make for a fun, if top-heavy, historical drama."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Vikings: Valhalla is a crafty continuation of Vikings, though lacking in the original series' spiritual (and structural) opaqueness, which was an element that made the old show stand apart from other historical dramas."
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"If valiant death in battle is a straight shot to Valhalla, the road to an epic escape from modern confusion and catastrophe leads straight through the mayhem of “Vikings: Valhalla.”"
Vikings: Valhalla,1,Vikings: Valhalla is a worthy sequel that accomplishes in building a larger world.
Vikings: Valhalla,1,"Sky-high production value and an A+ ensemble. Vikings: Valhalla is juggling quite a bit in Season 1, but manages to support it all with a well-structured narrative and a slew of stellar performances oozing with ferocity and conviction."
The Stranger,1,"With revelations dealt out like treats, actors of the quality of Stephen Rea and Jennifer Saunders in the cast, and pacing that is guaranteed to elevate your pulse rate, just try to watch one episode without being sucked in."
The Stranger,0,Starts great but it ultimately falls under the spell of character redention when it's not necessary. [Full review in Spanish].
The Stranger,1,Mediocre TV + Weird Mysteries - Restaurants x Extra Hours = Addiction.
The Stranger,1,"Each new discovery leads to more danger and often life-threatening results. Eight episodes, a binge-worthy weekend. Go for it."
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' is an effective and addictive thriller, but despite its overabundance of elements, it is incredibly meaningless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Stranger,1,"It's the kind of show where you keep saying ""this is ridiculous!"", but end up watching it all anyway."
The Stranger,1,Good fun.
The Stranger,1,"A clever, mystery thriller, that doesn't reveal its secrets until it absolutely has to."
The Stranger,1,"If you're a fan of British mysteries and strong women, I can't recommend it highly enough."
The Stranger,1,The skillfull tying together of all the twisty knots is an all-enveloping and charged experience.
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
The Stranger,1,"In elevating the emotional stakes to the same level as the conspiracy, Brocklehurst imbues ""The Stranger"" with a weight that stays with the viewer more effectively than all the other weekend crimetime options parading across TV schedules."
The Stranger,1,"The notable performances by Siobhan Finneran and Richard Armitage... are the strongest pillar that make the series work, even though it doesn't fulfill all its expectations. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Stranger,1,"The Stranger is a lot like most decent mystery novels: Entertaining, but meant to be consumed not remembered."
The Stranger,1,"[Harlan] Coben is nobody's idea of a literary crime writer, but this briskly recounted, plot-driven saga about skeletons in suburban closets is not entirely lacking in psychological insight."
The Stranger,1,"It's an enjoyable and entertaining series that, while it doesn't leave a lasting impression, also doesn't allow any time for boredom."
The Stranger,1,"Not dark enough to be great, but highly bingeable."
The Stranger,1,"A strong and sprawling cast (Stephen Rea is also in it, as is Jennifer Saunders) work hard to keep all the balls in the air, and you will feel a strong urge to watch the second episode immediately, if only to clear up a few things."
The Stranger,1,"The Stranger is a curious beast, an almost-pure mystery, which shows its machinery so nakedly that it almost defies you to switch off."
The Stranger,1,"It's your typical Coben yarn, with multiple and seemingly unrelated threads going on at once, characters who have dark secrets that are alluded to but not mentioned outright until enough tension is drawn out, and mysteries upon mysteries."
The Stranger,1,"It's mostly successful with some caveats, but does well with its performers and main narrative to unearth the truth and to become a reliable British mystery drama."
The Stranger,1,Yet the original hook remains.
The Stranger,1,"Anyone who binged The Five or Safe is likely to do the same with The Stranger, which delivers the same sort of empty-calorie thrills."
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' might hold some kind of interest to fans of Harlan Coben's work and are desperate to see it adapted to screen, but really, there's far better on offer than just this."
Shadow and Bone,1,"While its central narrative is as generic as they come in the fantasy genre, the world around it, as well as wonderful eclectic group of thieves The Crows, allow this series to transcend its tropes."
Shadow and Bone,1,"God, it feels great to watch a solid, interesting fantasy series with all the makings of an epic hit again."
Shadow and Bone,1,Book readers and new arrivals alike will be pleased: Shadow and Bone is an eight-episode addiction that will give you exactly what you didn't know you needed and leave you wanting more.
Shadow and Bone,1,"A sprawling adaptation of Leigh Bardugo's first Grishaverse novel, Shadow and Bone needlessly complicates matters by including fan favourite characters from Six of Crows. Takes a while to settle in, but overall this is compelling stuff"
Shadow and Bone,1,"It doesn't feel like it's dumbed down for television audience which is nice BUT it is a bit difficult to keep up with if you have never before heard of the ""Grishaverse"" (raises hand) because you practically need a glossary of characters."
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone succeeds where so many fantasy adaptations fail if you stay with it and understand that it requires a bit of patience. It takes inventive writing and great acting to really bring a world to life like this.
Shadow and Bone,1,Fans of the books should be pleased with this universe brought to life and those that prefer the Crows should enjoy the way they're weaved into Alina's story.
Shadow and Bone,1,"There's plenty to like about Shadow and Bone, not least its 19th century Russia-inspired aesthetic, and at eight episodes, it doesn't overstay its welcome."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone has managed to balance being faithful enough to the books that fans will be happy, with slight deviations to become its own being."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Vitally for a genre series in a time when we're all pretty much over grim dystopias, the show has a human heart, a rollicking pace, and an honest-to-god sense of humor."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The mold is not broken with Shadow and Bone, but there is a lot of refinement... All in all, the characters hold up, are nuanced, and have decent arcs that dip in and out of the heroes' journey."
Shadow and Bone,1,It was absolutely incredible to see these unforgettable characters come to life.
Shadow and Bone,1,"The fantastic elements of the series are quite imaginative and ingenious, and the construction of the universe is very detailed. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shadow and Bone,1,"The various details and peculiarities we find in the story make this series something exceptional, at least in its first season. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shadow and Bone,0,The storytelling in this adaptation from showrunner Eric Heisserer (Bird Box. Arrival) fails to establish and maintain a momentum nearly as powerful as some of the show's magic.
Shadow and Bone,1,"But while the attractions are clear, there is still the sense that this adaptation of the Grisha novel trilogy could have been so much more."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Despite several subplots, the show never feels overstuffed or long drawn out, and anchors its stories in moving human relationships."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Starring newcomers Jessie Mei Li, Archie Renaux and Freddy Carter, it flies by over the course of eight episodes of magic, espionage, violence and romance-in other words, all of the necessary ingredients to satisfy a fantasy fan."
Shadow and Bone,1,"...there are great characters, insurmountable odds, and a winning sense of humor. The writing, as Eric Heisserer is known for, is well composed, taut, and exciting--all fueled by relatable emotion. My anticipation for season 2 is real."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Perfectly competent, enjoyable stuff. But, like The Witcher and the other contenders for the Thrones' crown that there have been since, it doesn't - or can't, whether for merely budgetary or more creative constraints - build on what has gone before."
Shadow and Bone,1,It's strange: You almost want Alina to take a back step and let the darker side characters shine. Yet it's thanks to their wild card additions that Shadow and Bone stands apart from the packed ranks of young adult viewing.
Shadow and Bone,1,Loved getting swept into the world of Shadow and Bone for 8 hours and I would watch it again in a heartbeat!
Shadow and Bone,1,"While it takes the series a few episodes to find its footing, Shadow and Bone eventually settles into an even pace, balancing the story that has drawn its central viewership with the addition of characters for further world-building."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Stunningly gorgeous and mesmerizing, this enchanting series is the rightful heir to the Game of Thrones throne, and solid proof that TV adaptations can improve on their source material."
Shadow and Bone,1,"""Shadow and Bone"" is engaging as a story, but it's a fantastic experience in terms of its texture. You do not simply watch this series, you enter it."
Shadow and Bone,1,"If Shadow and Bone doesn't provide quite the level of characterizing nuance and challenging chronological complexity of The Witcher - and it does not - it does go down easier, and seems expressly intended to make long weekend afternoons pass more quickly."
Shadow and Bone,0,"Again and again, Shadow and Bone forces unearned story beats and melodrama. Its character-building is lackluster; its worldbuilding is mostly incoherent, and its script careens from one-liner to one-liner without much substance in between."
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone could use some intimacy! Its conflicts as currently written are way too big and too abstract; its characters are too generic and undefined.
Shadow and Bone,0,"The maddening thing is that when you actually understand what is happening in ""Shadow,"" there is some really good TV there."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Some may look at this as counting appearances instead of measuring performances, but all of these actors enliven the script with their portrayals; Young and Suman in particular make Shadow and Bone worth watching."
Shadow and Bone,0,"The show's political intrigue comes off as boilerplate, but the thrust of the source material's narrative remains largely unchanged."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow And Bone is predictable. It checks all the overly familiar boxes when it comes to fantasy stories like these. But it still feels epic, and the interesting characters make up for the paint by the numbers plotting."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The new series, which remixes Leigh Bardugo's popular Grisha books, will hook fans and newcomers alike with immersive world-building and complex, gorgeously costumed characters."
Shadow and Bone,1,"It's Heisserer's attention to detail, along with performances perfectly attuned to the conflicts in this fantasy world, that makes Shadow And Bone such an immersive experience."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone does a fantastic job at bringing the beloved Grishaverse to life. The world is stunning and vast, and we see so much of it, allowing us to be completely immersed in it."
Shadow and Bone,1,The first episode of Shadow And Bone gives every indication that it's going to be a successful fantasy franchise for Netflix.
Shadow and Bone,1,"That the casting is so intuitive and flawless is part of why the show will be a hit. Fans can fall in love with Li and Barnes and Renaux, but also the minor characters, who deserve at least as much attention."
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone is merely the latest reasonably handsome streaming series whose aspirations beyond qualifying as a mild diversion turn out to be mostly smoke and mirrors.
Shadow and Bone,1,"[Shadow and Bone] transcends familiarity thanks to the commitment of a pitch-perfect cast, well-stylized fight sequences, and intentional character development that makes these relationships feel nuanced and history-laden."
Shadow and Bone,1,"A gripping epic fantasy series with immersive worldbuilding, lavish costume and production design, stunning visual effects, and an appealing ensemble cast."
Shadow and Bone,1,"It's all very handsomely made, though the early episodes have a kind of young-adult vibe that isn't down to the youth of Alina and her pals. Worth a look."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Unlike its predecessors on film, this Netflix adaptation sets about improving on the source material's tired, sexist clichés at every turn, creating a lead character worthy of her own adventure series."
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone is proof that adapting someone else's work doesn't mean adapting all of their choices - it's possible to be bolder, more introspective, and in some cases corrective to the original story and come out looking better than ever."
Shadow and Bone,1,"While it's too early to signal whether Shadow and Bone will have the same impact on pop culture as Game of Thrones, it definitely has an opportunity to expand a wide-ranging universe."
Shadow and Bone,1,"While it lacks certain fantasy elements, Shadow and Bone more than makes up for it in expansive world-building and engaging characters"
Shadow and Bone,1,"[Shadow and Bone] stands out on its own merit with its talented cast, ambitious storytelling, and breathtaking world."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Fantastic world-building and a huge VFX budget are great, but it's the charismatic cast that's the real treat here. Shadow & Bone deserves to be a breakout hit for Netflix."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The series is not well-crafted enough to jump nimbly from one story line to another without immediately losing track of why audiences should care about this other plotline... Still, Shadow and Bone does mostly manage to pull it all together in the end."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Even the weakest of these stories paints Shadow and Bone's world as rich with lore and history, aided in large part by uncharacteristically noteworthy costuming."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The characters feel like a chosen family who are just starting to come together, and I can't wait to see how those relationships continue in future seasons."
Shadow and Bone,1,"This is a lively ride across a rich fantasy world. It's great to see Netflix invest in exciting new young adult fantasy (which will entertain many older adults, too)."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Will say this for Shadow And Bone: every damn penny of its massive Netflix budget is right up on the screen, though it's often difficult to appreciate the detail in the sets and costumes because the show is darker than that last battle in Game Of Thrones."
Shadow and Bone,1,"It's a beautifully made show, with the best visual touch beyond the effects being the costumes designed by Wendy Partridge, which lean heavily on Russian influences to make this world feel distinct and special from other fantasy tales."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Amid its grand settings, displays of fantastical abilities, the manifestation of myths and legends, and enough engaging (and occasionally messy) worldbuilding elements to inspire its own glossary, Shadow and Bone always remains grounded by its characters."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Alina is a young woman who captures your attention with her kindness, determination, and raw honesty. And you want her to succeed even when she stumbles along the way."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Kudos to the core casting as well, as Mei Li, Renaux and Barnes create and develop a worthy triangle for Alina as the Darkling and Mal tug at her heart."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Between the silly names and mythology, this is a thorough, detailed production, with crisp special effects and likeable lead performances from a diverse bunch."
Shadow and Bone,1,"You can watch the first season for the twisty world-building, Wendy Partridge's lovely costumes, several enjoyable performances and the comfort of its reliable YA plotting. Just don't expect to immediately understand everything."
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone is good clean fun with a vengeance.
Shadow and Bone,1,As a series Shadow and Bone looks set to intrigue and satisfy fans - though it may be a little confusing for outsiders.
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone balances familiar yet intriguing characters with expansive world building to create a compelling fantasy adventure.
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone is not a perfect adaptation of Bardugo's novels... Yet, as a whole, the series feels often feels downright magical, a thrilling adventure that always remains firmly anchored in the story of the complex heroine at its center."
Shadow and Bone,1,"The driving engine of the show is Alina, a challenge Li embraces... Li makes for a compelling center of gravity. Her Alina is smart and loyal, annoyed and rash, heartbroken and headstrong."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone works well as an adaptation because it not only recounts the events of the first book in the first Grishaverse trilogy, it expands on them, integrating new stories into the fold."
Shadow and Bone,1,"There are quite a few plotlines to balance, which isn't unheard of for fantasy stories, but it does mean this one season has to run through quite a bit of character introduction in order to tie it all together."
Shadow and Bone,1,"A refreshing new world...complex, charismatic, and so much fun."
Shadow and Bone,1,"It's worth watching, especially for the lesser-known Kit Young, Amita Suman and Danielle Galligan, as well as bigger name Ben Barnes. Once the clunky exposition gets out of the way, you can start to enjoy discovering the world you're in."
Shadow and Bone,1,"You're often going to hear people say that the books are better than their on-screen adaptations, but sometimes there are exceptions."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Shadow and Bone is a masterful interweaving of Bardugo's stories, with captivating characters set amidst a beautifully realized fantasy world."
Shadow and Bone,0,"More exhausting than thrilling, Netflix's latest period fantasy adventure, ""Shadow and Bone,"" will have a tough time breaking out of the fan base already built by the books."
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone is a triumph on multiple levels - one that near-perfectly marries its source material with the best tropes and tricks from the YA blockbusters and prestige fantasy television of the past decade.
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Dark and twisted, visually stunning, and a great introduction into the Grishaverse."
Shadow and Bone,1,"Some elements are overly familiar and others overly confusing, but Shadow And Bone will draw you into the Fold with its absorbing world-building and engaging lead duo."
Shadow and Bone,1,Shadow and Bone is Netflix's best fantasy show since The Witcher.
Shadow and Bone,1,The first season of SHADOW AND BONE will satisfy both fans of the Grishaverse novels and make converts of newcomers.
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is, without any doubt, one of the most culturally relevant tv shows."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable's unique take on cop dramas and amazing performances makes it worth it.
Unbelievable,1,Great performances almost always make fantastic TV shows. In this case we can confirm it. [Full review in Spanish].
Unbelievable,1,A brilliantly structured cat and mouse story that's also about the growing trust and bond between the detectives in the war against the male status quo.
Unbelievable,1,"You know the saying that the truth is always worse than anything we could imagine or come up with. Well, this Netflix limited series is an example of that."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable unfolds slowly and methodically and without melodrama. Its eight episodes take the time to show the cost of sexual assault on its victims, and its deliberateness heightens the ironic sting of the series' title."
Unbelievable,1,"What sets Unbelievable apart from a show like Mindhunter is that it is, first and foremost, from the perspective of the victims and their female counterparts working against a predominantly male system of indifference."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable still manages to make this harrowing real-life story into a compelling fictionalized account, one that will make for a fulfilling binge-watch."
Unbelievable,1,"It's an incredible story, one that creator Susannah Grant adapts well for the most part."
Unbelievable,1,The series is yet another reminder that hard-to-watch and must-watch are descriptions that are no longer mutually exclusive.
Unbelievable,1,"The storytelling is straightforward, shaped to the emotional curve of Marie's story, as she tries to get on with a life that seems to be contracting around her - Dever, impassively terrific, puts up a shield and acts behind it"
Unbelievable,1,"It's a powerful, impactful show that will stay with you for a long time. An unflinching look at justice, inequality, and the fantasy of a perfect victim."
Unbelievable,1,"If you like procedural crime dramas, it's top-notch."
Unbelievable,1,"It's bleak, but humane; enthralling, but not grossly manipulative. It is an extraordinary experience to watch and know that it's based on a true story. As such, it's unforgettable and easily one of the best crime dramas of the year."
Unbelievable,1,"Dever, Wever, and Collette-as the three women centered in this investigation-turn in performances every bit as compelling and committed as this material demands."
Unbelievable,1,Much of the power of the series comes from watching the stellar performances by Collette and Wever as two alpha females who spar with each other as they solve the crime.
Unbelievable,1,"Somehow, miracle of miracles, a mainstream Hollywood production has finally gotten a Christian character right."
Unbelievable,1,"In lesser hands Unbelievable might slowly unravel, but in the hands of writers Susannah Grant, Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and director Lisa Cholodenko, it gets more riveting by the second."
Unbelievable,1,"As a true crime miniseries, Unbelievable does well in telling the womens' side of things, depicting their trauma, and how they are forced to relive the horrific events over and over."
Unbelievable,1,One of Unbelievable's strongest elements is the relationship between these two women - enhanced by the actors' skill in creating a prickly relationship between two strong personalities.
Unbelievable,1,"This story about the pursuit of a serial rapist in California could have been lurid or tacky, but instead it's commendably thoughtful and spends almost all its time on the victims and their struggle to be believed."
Unbelievable,1,"On Unbelievable, we really see a difference between what happens to survivors who are believed and the ones who are written off from the start."
Unbelievable,1,"Further, while the writing is definitely elevated by the quality of the cast, the script is lean and moves along at a snappy pace, striking a perfect balance between exhilarating tension and deep despair."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is the best, most human, most complex police procedural I've seen in a long, long time."
Unbelievable,1,Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are an instantly likable female empowered duo that I want more of.
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is an engrossing and perfectly put together series.
Unbelievable,1,"Amazing, enraging and utterly absorbing."
Unbelievable,1,One of the most comprehensive and involving examinations of crime ever presented on either the big or small screen.
Unbelievable,1,"Powerful, sympathetic drama shows a victim's side."
Unbelievable,1,"[A]bout 10 hours after I had started watching, I found myself finishing episode eight, completely overwhelmed by the humanity, intelligence and warmth of this brilliant show."
Unbelievable,1,"This is based on true events and it is excellent and insightful and important and also works as a straight-up taut, gripping thriller."
Unbelievable,1,"This is biting, gripping, and not least moving."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable might be the first cop show to focus not on how ""impartial objectivity"" is the only way to handle an investigation, but how much that objectivity can actually f*ck it."
Unbelievable,1,It makes great television.
Unbelievable,1,That is precisely the narrative decision that the series creators have taken: what matters is the word. [Full Review in Spanish]
Unbelievable,1,"What takes it to the next level are the finely honed performances by the three lead actresses as well as a meticulous deconstruction of how the criminal justice system treats those brave enough to report sex crimes, and whom it chooses to believe."
Unbelievable,1,Series such as... Unbelievable do something else too: They impose justice on a world that is anything but fair.
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is a riveting and, ultimately, vindicating watch in its own right, but it's also a useful counterpoint to how such series are typically made."
Unbelievable,1,"While not a spotless transition from article to script, it's very much a ""show, don't tell"" portrayal of the real-life events and fallout, which lands in a must-watch spot that is thought-provoking without being preachy."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't light viewing. But in defending reality against received wisdom and eschewing suspense in favor of insight, it makes a plea for revising simplistic rape narratives."
Unbelievable,1,"This is a faithful adaptation that plainly lays out the victims' stories and lets the audience see for themselves how differently they were treated, down to every question."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable does what very few shows centred around sexual assault have managed to do: It debunks the black and white narratives of the social and systemic politics of rape.
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable needs to be excruciating and infuriating but also watchable. And the platform where it airs might be the only place where it can accomplish that goal.
Unbelievable,1,"It's equally a sad and enraging look, fictionalised in terms of character names but otherwise faithful to the source material."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is and will remain a Netflix series not to be missed.
Unbelievable,1,"The obstacles to reporting rape and other crimes of sexual nature are still to this day, astronomical. But the women of Unbelievable make it feel like justice could be within our grasp."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable also features an exceptional array of talent, starting with writer-creator Susannah Grant... Her scripts are executed by three remarkable actresses."
Unbelievable,1,"Anchored by three quiet but powerful performances, particularly Kaitlyn Dever's systematically overruled Marie who so often expresses herself in silence, Unbelievable centers the human toll of these blights on our national character."
Unbelievable,1,Toni Collette and Merritt Wever make a formidable team of detectives.
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable confronts harsh realities and is hard to watch at times, but it is essential viewing."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable doesn't make for easy watching...but it's one of the most complex onscreen depictions of sexual assault in recent memory.
Unbelievable,1,"Most of the best moments are simple, like Duvall's pensive reactions to new information: shock or grief or excitement silently written on Wever's face. The story tells itself."
Unbelievable,1,"Difficult to watch, but absolutely necessary, the new Netflix miniseries handles an important subject with the empathy, patience, and respect that it deserves."
Unbelievable,1,"Kaitlyn Dever's performance as a damaged, exploited product of a flawed foster care system is utterly explosive"
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is a compelling and well-crafted eight-part series, with the likes of writer Susannah Grant, novelist Michael Chabon, director Lisa Cholodenko and journalist and author Katie Couric involved behind the camera."
Unbelievable,1,"There are several twists and turns throughout all eight episodes, but the series is cleverly plotted with just the right amount of reveals per episode to keep viewers tuned into the whole thing."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable has strong writing and performances, and the fact that the story is based on actual events makes Marie Adler's part of the story all the more remarkable."
Unbelievable,1,"The series is a warning, a devastating example of the consequences of not believing women. But the writers successfully prevent it from becoming pedantic or hacky."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It's about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed."
Unbelievable,1,"This story would be real (even if it hadn't been based on true life events), it is the honest fear and the hardship of women told in eight visceral chapters."
Unbelievable,1,"The best crime dramas, whether fiction or fact, find an emotional core within the clinical procedural details. Few achieve that balance better than Unbelievable."
Unbelievable,1,"This is a smart and knowing investigative procedural, a stylish but never exploitative true-crime story, an insightful character study - and one of the best series of the year."
Unbelievable,0,"As thematically fascinating as Unbelievable can be, it's also often dramatically plodding, if not grueling."
Unbelievable,1,"The most standout aspect of Unbelievable, though, is that it shines light on survivors and heroes, rather than dwelling upon the psyches of perpetrators of violent crimes."
Unbelievable,1,"It's an uncommon treat to see such a strong, multi-generational cast of women holding together a work that illuminates a vitally important issue."
Unbelievable,1,"'Unbelievable' is a gripping and harrowing story that demands your attention throughout without ever sensationalising its subject matter, but rather handles it with the sensitivity and respect it deserves."
Unbelievable,1,"This is a startlingly faithful adaptation and as such, it checks the boxes a piece of investigative journalism might check: It shows what happened, yes, but also why."
Unbelievable,1,"It's a tough watch, but it's a rewarding one, not just because it has one of the best ensembles of the year but because of what it says about hope and empathy."
Unbelievable,1,"Even as Unbelievable hits familiar beats, it never loses its resonance."
Unbelievable,1,This occasionally emotionally manipulative but consistently engaging drama stays true to the sensitivity of the case at its core whilst maintaining its entertainment value.
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is a solid true-crime series that many will appreciate for existing.
Unbelievable,1,"With Unbelievable, the creative team and superb cast treat the subject with the seriousness and grace it deserves, while also telling one hell of a story along the way."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable isn't just a gripping story, it's an incredibly compelling argument for why we need to take a frank look at the way victims of sexual assault are treated and how seriously we take them."
Unbelievable,1,"Dever play[s] her heartbreak in quiet and deepening shadings, never pandering for outrage."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is a superb example of what show-don't-tell storytelling looks like.
Unbelievable,1,Kaitlyn Dever's heartbreaking performance as the vilified Marie will make you desperate for vindication.
Unbelievable,1,"Created by Erin Brockovich screenwriter Susannah Grant and directed by Olive Kitteridge's Lisa Cholodenko, Unbelievable's eight-part, True Detective-style investigation is gripping, emotion-inducing viewing."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable depicts the heartbreaking, yet gratifying, moment these parallel stories finally intersected."
Unbelievable,1,"Measured in many aspects and mercurial in other ways, Unbelievable is unmissable."
Unbelievable,0,The series feels like a vehicle built merely to convey the information dug up by its progenitors.
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable is an extremely satisfying experience - not just for its storytelling, but for its depiction of women who confront their reality rather than succumbing to it."
Unbelievable,1,"Unbelievable, at its best, is focused less on the system at large than on one individual ground up by it."
Unbelievable,1,Unbelievable is a knockout crime drama that pushes the genre ahead with tenderness.
Unbelievable,1,"""Unbelievable"" is an extremely compelling suspenseful drama based on a true story."
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
The Crown,1,"You've got to hand it to screenwriter Peter Morgan, he does know how to wring out every last drop of psychological drama from stories with which we might otherwise feel overfamiliar."
The Crown,0,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations."
The Crown,1,"Eminently watchable, eternally classy, and enormously well performed, S4 sparkles and other points exasperates, but in that sense reflects the tenor of the era it covers."
The Crown,1,"""White rich people dealing with white rich problems"" remains one of TV's most satisfying genres. In a year without Succession, no series could dethrone Peter Morgan's royal drama. The fourth season was the jewel in its crown."
The Crown,1,"The Crown creators have outdone themselves this season, and as they prepare for a time jump and a cast change, it's sad to see such a strong cast go - but we can't wait to see what they have in store next."
The Crown,1,"From the shy smile, to the cocked head and whispered voice, [Corrin] has perfectly captured the mouse that eventually roared."
The Crown,1,"The Crown's fourth outing is the show back at its best. You may well come to it for the visual feast of Diana and Thatcher, but you'll leave with lots of food for thought - the mark of great telly."
The Crown,1,"It is never gripping but it is always entertaining: a much-needed dollop of well-made, well-written, slowly-paced telly."
The Crown,1,"It's telling that the most sympathetic newcomer this season is Michael Fagan, the Brit who sneaked into the palace in 1982 and confronted the queen in her bedroom."
The Crown,1,"It is, without a doubt, the season many Crown viewers have been waiting for."
The Crown,1,"The real star of this fourth season is, inevitably, Diana."
The Crown,1,"The dissonance between spoiled Royals and the modern world has turned darker, and the nobility seems a lot less noble. But it's still a fascinating mess for us mere mortals to watch."
The Crown,1,"Corrin beautifully brings to life the shy magnetism coupled with the fragile naivety of the iconic Princess, as well as the rumored affairs and eating disorder resulting from the pain and isolation of life inside a loveless marriage on the world stage."
The Crown,1,It's the kind of run that would have kept the Queen Mum glued to the telly.
The Crown,1,"Colman remains a delight, and I could watch her read a phone book."
The Crown,1,"[It] does not suddenly find a low-key groove - it deploys a hunting metaphor with which it repeatedly slaps the viewer around the face in these first episodes - but because the subject matter is so big and bombastic, it does fit together with more ease."
The Crown,1,"Decades of perspective and mythmaking make it impossible to turn away. This season, The Crown takes a step forward and lives up to the historical moments it brings to life."
The Crown,1,"With Netflix finally delivering the long awaited arrival of Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher, the pricey royal drama is back in gear with high drama and political intrigue, anchored by two era-defining women."
The Crown,1,Sheesh. It's still a great watch.
The Crown,1,"Just like the real royals, The Crown benefits from the arrival of Diana Spencer."
The Crown,1,The Crown is deeper than just a sumptuous soap opera. It pictorially assesses the social consequences of a once great power in decline.
The Crown,1,"The saga continues with outstanding performances by the entire cast but especially Emma Corrin, Josh O'Connor and Gillian Anderson."
The Crown,1,This high-level soap so smoothly builds each climactic moment that even a less emotionally attached viewer will find that this season is one success after another.
The Crown,1,There was an egregious lack of Porchey this season. Truly unforgivable.
The Crown,1,"It's better than the last, which got bogged down a little in dead times. But there is, with modern times, the temptation to take sides; and there's little doubt where creator Peter Morgan has nailed his colours."
The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin, as the princess, perfectly captured Diana's youthful spirit and slowly crumbling optimism. Gillian Anderson made a not terribly convincing Mrs Thatcher, far too mannered, even for made-over Maggie, but otherwise everyone was on their game."
The Crown,1,"It's a triumph, this season, mostly because the Diana we've all been waiting for is a triumph. She is played by Emma Corrin, who is sensational."
The Crown,1,It more than delivers on its consistency but my one major bug bear this time around is the humanisation of a woman who could have given Saddam Hussein a run for his money.
The Crown,1,"Honest and unhampered by affectation, Colman, the most humble of stars, shows us how little Elizabeth knows and how much she needs to know in her changing world."
The Crown,1,"Once more, the second episode of the fourth season returns The Crown to what makes this soap opera so delectable: It's a royal family trapped in archaic rituals cowering in palaces in the hopes of continued survival."
The Crown,1,The real-life melodrama about Great Britain's royal family was already the most addictive show on TV... but now it's way better.
The Crown,1,"The Crown is shrewd enough to start the new series with Charles and Di, but the Prince of Wales needs a crash course in pomposity."
The Crown,1,Diana's arrival gives The Crown a chance to recapture the magic of spectacle. Few series evoke a sense of awe and wonder quite like Morgan's Royal Family fantasies.
The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin is superb as Diana, always believable in her journey from naive teenager thrown in at the deep end to driven yet lonely powerhouse. (Though I'm now over allegorical stags being stalked at Balmoral.)"
The Crown,1,"Emma Corrin captures the shyness of Diana's public face, and it is hard not to empathise as she is left to wallow alone for weeks on end."
The Crown,1,"The Crown takes addictive soap opera drama and elevates it to grand, cinematic heights with picturesque locations, opulent sets, well-researched costumes, and a moving score."
The Crown,1,"The more Gillian Anderson pops into the narrative, the more obvious she's crafted this role into the finest of an already lauded career."
The Crown,1,Series four of The Crown ranks as the most entertaining yet because of the depth of its engagement with the times in which it's set.
The Crown,0,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.
The Crown,1,"I don't know how much literal truth there is in the story The Crown is telling about the royals... But the season's insights into our emotions and familial volatility, and its ways of articulating it in such reflective ways, need no added research."
The Crown,1,"These Charles/Di go-rounds may indeed butter ""The Crown's"" bread, but the real news this time is Gillian Anderson's devastatingly precise portrayal of Margaret Thatcher."
The Crown,1,"While I have no doubt Imelda Staunton will be terrific in the final seasons, The Crown has a way of making you regret the inevitable march of time."
The Crown,1,"It's a credit to newcomer Corrin and partner-in-despair Josh O'Connor - a needy, narcissistic and thoroughly unsympathetic Charles - that their relationship does more than simply rake over old ground."
The Crown,1,"Give Gillian Anderson an Emmy. That's it, that's the sentence."
The Crown,1,"With Season 4, the stakes are higher across the board and the bingeworthiness returns. Spectacular performances go down. Corrin is heartbreaking during many moments, and Gillian Anderson is reaching out for an Emmy."
The Crown,1,"No longer is The Crown merely showing us history, it's making us feel it as if we were living (or reliving) it."
The Crown,1,"Diana's entry into The Crown has been anticipated since the series was first announced, and Corrin's portrayal of the Princess of Wales is delicate and assured enough to live up to the high expectations first-time viewers of the series may have."
The Crown,1,Perhaps the best and most riveting season of the series yet.
The Crown,1,"This season has finally added the last, previously missing piece: a universally gripping narrative."
The Crown,1,Gillian Anderson might be the best Thatcher ever seen on screen. Hers is not so much an impersonation as an inhabitation.
The Crown,1,"There is a welcome, absorbing quality to jumping back into ""The Crown."""
The Crown,1,"The entrances of Emma Corrin as Princess Diana and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher steal the show with tour-de-force performances, but the whole cast elevates their game in The Crown's most powerful season yet."
The Crown,1,The characters are excellently utilized by the acting quality. [Full review in Spanish]
The Crown,1,The emotionally charged fourth season of The Crown is a staggering achievement.
The Crown,1,"The Crown is also at its best when it explores the economic and political crises throughout our country's history, which it does a lot in this series."
The Crown,1,This is the season of The Crown you've been waiting for.
The Crown,1,"The Crown continues being one of the best original series on Netflix, giving us excellent scripts, direction, performances, production values, and the ability to transport us to moments on screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Crown,1,"Gillian Anderson is a revelation in the role of Thatcher, giving one of the finest performances of her career."
The Crown,1,"The fourth season of The Crown is nothing short of spectacular. Bringing to life Britain under Thatcherism, and weaving in the story of the young Princess Diana and her dysfunctional marriage with Prince Charles is prodigiously delivered."
The Crown,1,Anderson's brilliant portrayal shows the prime minister at her most human and her most inhumane.
The Crown,1,"For three seasons, as it dutifully focused on Elizabeth and her immediate family, The Crown sometimes seemed to give itself nothing to push back against...this season, it belongs to the victims as well."
The Crown,1,Diana's much-awaited appearance suggests The Crown's appeal does not necessarily lie in the trappings of monarchy so much as in the possibility of its destruction.
The Crown,1,Season 4 manages to perfectly capture everything we love to hate about this fictitious version of the royal family and is only elevated by Anderson and Corrin's introductions of Thatcher and Diana.
The Crown,1,Helena Bonham Carter's Princess Margaret is beautifully nuanced and Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth continues her stellar work.
The Crown,1,No longer are we gazing at expensively made period drama about barely knowable people. We are looking in the rearview mirror at people and events that galvanized the world not long ago.
The Crown,1,"10 episodes of television that may not be uniformly among the show's finest, but which are somehow its most authentic."
The Crown,1,"The new season of the series is delicious, and I ate it up rather quickly, and now I'm hungry for more. It's as beautifully shot as ever, every visual is breathtaking."
The Crown,1,"The best and most addictive season yet. All 10 episodes are a binge-watcher's dream. Olivia Colman is the shining jewel in 'The Crown,"" but Emmy love, please, for Emma Corrin as Lady Di and a knockout Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher."
The Crown,1,"In season four, the show's resemblance to The Godfather is more pronounced than ever. The royals have more in common with a crime family than they'd perhaps like to believe, but at least the Corleones cared for each other."
The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature."
The Crown,1,"If anything, Season 4 of ""The Crown"" suffers from an overabundance of plotlines that beg for more attention, whether it's Princess Margaret coping with her diminished status, or the bracingly snide depiction of Prince Andrew."
The Crown,1,"This new set of episodes continues to give us both the long run and the short, the epic and the specific, as it goes from strength to strength."
The Crown,1,"The season that finally introduces Diana, Princess of Wales, is one of the series' strongest."
The Crown,1,"Season four of The Crown leans heavily on the Charles/Diana drama, but is still a great watch."
The Crown,1,Best season yet.
The Crown,1,"The Crown observes that the royals' failures can more often than not be self-inflicted -- and in doing so, the show produces its most thrilling and biting season yet."
The Crown,1,"Anderson's transformation is mesmerizing, not least the feeble, raspy voice that belies the strength and ruthlessness with which Thatcher sets about her business."
The Crown,1,"The dramatic pacing of this season is very intelligent, as is its decision to leap beyond the palace walls from time to time to illustrate the straitened circumstances of those at the wrong end of Mrs Thatcher's laissez-faire capitalist experiments."
The Crown,1,"The show remains an utterly enjoyable binge, even if the latest season doesn't quite measure up to the previous ones -- a byproduct of the years and conflicts encompassed."
The Crown,1,"Corrin is startlingly good at capturing the princess' charismatic shimmer. Her Diana is silly and eager for attention... Yet this winsome young woman also exudes warmth, decency and fun."
The Crown,1,"Ultimately, though, what Thatcher and especially Diana do is land maternal doubts at Elizabeth's feet. It's a facet of the queen we've seldom seen even on The Crown."
The Crown,1,"The sheer audaciousness of the script continues to thrill: how could anyone know what the Queen and Princess Anne talked about, seated on a picnic blanket in the middle of nowhere?"
The Crown,1,"Together, Thatcher and Diana give The Crown an energy and a sense of direction it lacked in the third season, and a feeling of verve the show has arguably never approached before."
The Crown,1,"The result is an absorbing season, both incredibly satisfying and, often, painful to watch unfold."
The Crown,1,There's no fairy tale here; only a real-life soap opera plotline that played out in front of billions. That's part of the reason why this season works so well.
The Crown,1,"'The Crown' Season 4 finds itself caught between trying to maintain its gilded scenery and elegant trappings, and the lurid tabloid appeal of indiscretions, martial chaos, and familial infighting. The results make for some sharply-realised drama."
The Crown,1,"THE CROWN is an impeccably crafted, gorgeously shot, and fantastically performed saga. It loves its royals, yet also pities them, and maybe even reviles such scoundrels. You will too."
The Crown,1,"If you think the Roys play a mean game of Boar on the Floor, wait until you see the Royals!"
The Crown,1,"Much of series three felt like a warm up act, a prelude to bigger, better drama. With the arrival of some new blood in the form of Gillian Anderson's Thatcher and Emma Corrin's Princess Diana, round four provides just that."
The Crown,1,"I remember in detail almost every event here that I found it so entertaining. Yes, there is a shaky start and the odd historical inaccuracy, but it is in my view Morgan's best series yet and, overall, five-star television."
The Crown,1,"Many actresses have essayed Mrs Thatcher, but her biographer Charles Moore is surely correct in his assertion that Gillian Anderson's performance here is the most convincing yet."
The Crown,1,"Playing Lady Diana from a waifish teen to a young wife to a miserable princess, Emma Corrin nails the head tilts and shy smiles, effortless glamour, and inner turmoil."
The Crown,1,"Smooth, perhaps not. But it's definitely soapy. For all its flaws, The Crown gives us what we demand from the royal cavalcade - nonstop high drama and emotion, wrapped in a fairytale."
The Crown,1,The stillness at the centre of this storm is Colman. She is quietly riveting as the plot wends its way to a predictable conclusion.
The Crown,1,"The show wouldn't work nearly as well as it does, however, without its uniformly excellent performances"
The Crown,1,"The main takeaway in Season 4, though, will be Morgan's interpretation of the story of Charles and Diana and the performances of Josh O'Connor and Corrin in those roles."
The Crown,1,"Anderson embodies the PM's physicality precisely. Aided by the words of writer, creator and executive producer Peter Morgan, Anderson gifts Thatcher with a rare nuance and flinty emotion that reads as entirely authentic."
The Crown,1,"The Crown has successfully sold itself as one of TV's most serious dramas. The fourth season, in all its shameless glory, may be its most successful yet even as it puts that prestigious perception to bed."
The Crown,1,"The Crown season four is a success, by and large - especially when it comes to Charles and Diana - but at times I did feel it was uneven and imperfect."
The Crown,1,"Even when The Crown isn't at its best from a story perspective, the series remains one of the best looking shows out there, from a technical standpoint."
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
The Crown,1,"What makes Corrin a good Diana is that she too possesses an inherent charm and appeal. She remains sympathetic throughout, even in scenes with O'Connor when the two are shouting at one another as their marriage collapses."
The Crown,1,"All of this is familiar. Very painfully, infuriatingly familiar. But as ""The Crown"" in this season shows, with a steel spine and ice in its veins, the Monarchy was built to withstand whatever onslaught comes its way."
The Crown,1,"O'Connor is uncannily skilled at portraying the prince's chimeric moods - the arrogance and entitlement, the hangdog malaise, the insecurity and yearning."
The Crown,1,"Brilliantly compelling television that you will absolutely rattle through. A huge turnaround from the previous season, with much more excitement provided by newcomers Thatcher and Diana. A triumph."
The Crown,1,"A stunning fourth season finds Queen Elizabeth, Margaret Thatcher & Diana Spencer in royal, political and marital turmoil. A masterpiece in storytelling & cinematic artistry."
The Crown,1,"The Crown season 4 might be the most interesting season of the Netflix show yet, for one key reason: it seems determined to make us dislike, even downright loathe, every member of the House of Windsor, from Queen Elizabeth on down."
The Crown,1,"The fourth season of The Crown isn't fully a triumph, but the episodes where it focuses more on the societal changes rocking the country during Thatcher's rule and less on the domestic squabbles are some of the strongest in its entire run."
The Crown,1,The Crown season 4 is the best season yet of the Netflix royal drama and boasts added momentum and marvellous performances with the additions of Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and newcomer Emma Corrin as Princess Diana.
BoJack Horseman,1,"Once again, Bojack is asking the societal questions that few TV shows are."
BoJack Horseman,1,"I'm hopeful that the second part of the show's final season will... further shift from BoJack's limited lens and, instead, give these women the space, time, and justice they need to heal - on their terms."
BoJack Horseman,1,"I binged BoJack during a lossy time in my life. I watched to absorb a truism in digestible cartoon form: the more we flail around trying to avoid the pain of loss, the more we lose."
BoJack Horseman,1,"This 2014-2020 anamorphic animated comedy/drama manages to touch on so many real-life examples of social, cultural, political, and philosophical events that infuse the human condition."
BoJack Horseman,1,"If it disappoints, well, that is ""classic BoJack"": the show, like its antihero, will make you love it even as it lets you down."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Like all every topic the show has courageously covered in its six seasons, Bojack's ending drives the point home that there are no neatly wrapped conclusions. In fact, it's almost boring-life's a bitch, but it goes on."
BoJack Horseman,1,"The humour almost always lands, and while it rarely goes for belly laughs, it is more about light moments of relief as BoJack's world comes crashing down."
BoJack Horseman,1,"This result - a finale that asks ""How does BoJack go on with his life now?"" without really giving a solid answer - is a fitting one for a show that wanted to explore the life of an awful person with unexamined mental health issues and addiction."
BoJack Horseman,1,"In the end, this is a show about growth, and Season 6 proved that the series evolved along with its characters."
BoJack Horseman,0,"I've faithfully followed BoJack Horseman from its beginning, and have frequently found it quite funny and fitfully touching, but as time goes on I find it more difficult to fully embrace the show as a meaningful work."
BoJack Horseman,1,"The last few episodes hit all the right, bittersweet notes, and make the entire journey feel richer for how smartly the show chose its ultimate destination."
BoJack Horseman,1,"In the end the depressed horse show didn't just give us a way to vocalize our own vulnerabilities, insecurities, and mental anguish. It also gave us hope for a better future, as well as a guide for us all to find our own happiness."
BoJack Horseman,1,The greatest accomplishment of BoJack Horseman is its reflection of the darker elements of the human experience and our ability to overcome them
BoJack Horseman,1,This season strongly homes in on BoJack's damaged psyche as his bad behaviour takes even darker turns.
BoJack Horseman,1,"It's a beautiful, life-affirming end to one of the greatest TV shows of our time."
BoJack Horseman,1,"The emotional generosity of the series extends right up until that final, lovely, lingering moment."
BoJack Horseman,1,"I'll especially miss the voice of BoJack, Will Arnett. Going beyond his Batman growl and 30 Rock simper, Arnett eloquently expressed a horse's existential woes."
BoJack Horseman,1,"It's a career-defining role for Arnett, but all the leads have found sensitivity and nuance amid the gags."
BoJack Horseman,1,An elegant conclusion for a complicated story.
BoJack Horseman,1,"Offers a vision of personal growth that can't be purchased or reduced into a hashtag. It presents a grown-up vision of self-care, one that is equal parts compassion and tough love."
BoJack Horseman,1,"The final episodes of BoJack Horseman are ambitious, but not because there's some grand design to come to a valuable, teachable conclusion. Instead, it simply feels real."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack Horseman handles the developments in its long-running Me Too-style story line with the show's signature mix of thoughtfulness, earned snark, and occasional outright silliness."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Intense character studies and gutting melodrama are rampant within BoJack Horseman, but the series is still as frustratingly funny as it's always been. There is so much to marvel at here."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack, after five seasons, is almost likable now, and, if nothing else, seems far more sincere than he has in the past about getting straight and holding himself accountable."
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
BoJack Horseman,1,It's a bittersweet beginning of the end. But that's only fitting for a show this true to life.
BoJack Horseman,1,"It will come as no surprise, then, that although it's a fine start to the final season, the first half of BoJack Horseman season [6] feels remarkably unfinished."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack Horseman continues to prove it is one of the best American animated series in decades, and as it nears its ending, it promises an emotionally devastating, and maybe hopeful ending."
BoJack Horseman,1,Will Arnett's voice performance as BoJack is as pathos-filled and hilarious as ever.
BoJack Horseman,1,The show is as funny and surprising as it always was.
BoJack Horseman,1,"Season six feels like a show ready to go out on top, lining up all its principle players for meaningful conclusions to this delightfully surreal journey."
BoJack Horseman,1,The sixth year of BoJack Horseman is looking to be an absolute powerhouse of a season.
BoJack Horseman,1,The episode continues with some of the zanier comedy that has been missing from the season.
BoJack Horseman,1,"For now, the series leaves viewers to contemplate the problem for themselves. Based on his arc over these eight episodes, I'm convinced: Against all odds, BoJack has changed."
BoJack Horseman,1,"There are glimmers of hope amid the blackness, like the recurring image of the starry skies that seem to haunt BoJack, but this is a series too concerned with the truth to let its bad man off that easy."
BoJack Horseman,1,The self-examination that has taken place both within the story and in the writing room has demonstrated a maturity capable of tackling such broad and complicated issues.
BoJack Horseman,1,"Season 6 has a steady, startling throughline: BoJack is trying."
BoJack Horseman,1,"As the lead-up to Bojack's final reckoning, Season 6 Part 1 is funny, masterfully written, and increasingly heartbreaking."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack's final season seems to be purposefully slowing down, trying to give us a grounded landing that is emotionally satisfying."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Seeing all the pieces line up, it's as if they'd been planning this and exactly this from the very beginning."
BoJack Horseman,1,'BoJack Horseman' has known very well how to cross the emotional walls of the spectators to achieve an unrepeatable connection with their characters. [Full review in Spanish]
BoJack Horseman,1,"Rest assured that this season isn't a complete drag. New elements work with old elements to make this season exciting, but also familiar."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Knowing BoJack Horseman is coming to an end is painful enough, and these eight episodes do make an effort to smooth the edges off that sadness."
BoJack Horseman,1,"In some of the new season's most affecting scenes, BoJack shows Princess Carolyn literally fragmenting herself to get through her daily routine... BoJack seems to understand how performative the job of trying to ""have it all"" or ""do it all"" can be."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack has always been easy and encouraging to binge, but this season's more introspective tone highlights the meticulousness and truthfulness of the characters."
BoJack Horseman,1,"What follows is a standout season where the typically inward-facing show turns outward, widening the lens to ask what we owe one another."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Somewhere deep down, you always knew this would come back to haunt him."
BoJack Horseman,1,"BoJack Horseman has always been a world of stepping forward and stepping right back, but in ""A Horse Walks Into A Rehab,"" BoJack responds by taking a second step forward."
BoJack Horseman,1,"The show's latest season...goes a step further, giving the audience a 360-degree view of how assault can change a victim's life."
BoJack Horseman,1,"Bojack Horseman is not letting any of its characters off the hook. It's still got sly Hollywood parodies and all new characters with animal pun names, but by season 6, Bojack fans can handle the show's mature themes."
BoJack Horseman,1,"On a technical level, the first half of BoJack Horseman season 6 is another masterstroke of adult animation, stuffed with whiplash-inducing sight gags and zingers. Emotionally, it leaves me wanting more-which, in all fairness, is the point."
BoJack Horseman,1,"This may be the weightiest season of BoJack, but introspection has never dulled the show's humor or sense of fun before, and it doesn't start now."
BoJack Horseman,1,The entire creative team is just running on all cylinders this season and all of the classic scathing critiques of modern society are ample and impactful.
BoJack Horseman,1,BoJack may be the most important-and beloved-animated series since The Simpsons.
The Good Place,1,"I loved escaping to a world where people are basically good, cruelty is bad, and fairness and justice are worthwhile pursuits."
The Good Place,1,"It only sometimes makes me sad when I remember what life was like the last time I watched new episodes of The Good Place, which was ... only nine months ago."
The Good Place,1,"I personally was surprised to find the show reckoning with heavy texts about goodness and ethics and death, but at the same time it does make sense to me that [it] would engage with such things..."
The Good Place,1,I started weeping and didn't stop.
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place series finale was so beautiful, so well thought out, and so expertly executed that it nearly convinced me to die. It was that good."
The Good Place,1,"Much like Bojack Horseman, The Good Place asks viewers to grapple with morality, mortality, and the effects of our smallest choices."
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place is over. I'm sad that it's done, but I'm also grateful for the time I spent with it. I think I'm ready for it to go. Take it sleazy, everyone."
The Good Place,1,"After the midseason finale, The Good Place is at its absolute best, digging even deeper into the philosophy that they've been exploring without once losing its comedic moment."
The Good Place,1,It was nice to see them be rewarded in the end.
The Good Place,1,"The jokes are solid and come in predictable beats, thanks to a writers room staffed by some of the funniest people in Hollywood."
The Good Place,1,"It was a delight to have The Good Place on TV, and it's even better that the show got to walk through the door on its own terms."
The Good Place,1,"Dunked as we are in candy-coated artifice and carefully crafted lies, our world needs more Eleanors, willing to stand up and say that we're all being duped."
The Good Place,1,"If you never tried the show, I urge you to go back to the beginning and soak it all in."
The Good Place,1,"It was one of the purest shows on television, and it arrived exactly when we needed it. Now we must let it go..."
The Good Place,1,"The series finale didn't try to confound audiences with a twist or a new take on morality, but instead focused on the relationships that always made the show special."
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place went out on its own terms, with a finale that argued that choosing your own ending is both a reward you earn and a gift you give."
The Good Place,1,"The series' greatest strength was that it knew when it was time to pass on, and ultimately, The Good Place's series finale was a fitting send-off for one of the best shows on television."
The Good Place,1,"A comedic appraisal of philosophy, morality, and the meaning of life. All of this was made palatable to network TV viewers with the help of winning stars, joyful puns... and a lightness of tone that kept things defiantly frivolous."
The Good Place,1,"With its tremendous heart and unwavering commitment to the stakes of The Good Place's ethical inquiries, [the series finale] is a delightful return to form."
The Good Place,1,"It was just like us: imperfect, messy, ambitious, loving, open-hearted, funny and well-intentioned. Or at least, it was just like the best version of ourselves we can be."
The Good Place,1,"It attacks each question, and provides answers that are lovely and satisfying. The show is a wild rollercoaster, and a roaringly good time, but in the end, I think that's the show's greatest legacy."
The Good Place,1,"A sweet series the likes of which had never been seen before and, now that it's over, we'll not likely get again."
The Good Place,1,[The finale] was a perfect hour of television.
The Good Place,1,"""The Good Place"" was a perfectly absurd series, the success of which is something we're not likely to see again in this lifetime. Whatever the fork this lifetime is, or was, or will be. Frozen yogurt, anyone?"
The Good Place,1,The Good Place may be traditional TV's last great comedy.
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place demonstrates what ""effort"" looks like, and what goodness takes: Learning, vulnerability, struggle, failure, and most of all, perhaps, the help of a few good friends."
The Good Place,1,"If The Good Place isn't a total outlier in the vast matrix of Peak TV, which reportedly cranked out more than 500 scripted programs in 2019, it's certainly the only show with such lofty ambitions still airing on a broadcast network."
The Good Place,1,"Overall, it was a solid entry into the comedy's final season. The stakes are higher than ever before, and I'm intrigued to see how it all ends."
The Good Place,1,"If the ethics-obsessed core characters in this endlessly self-aware series have taught us anything, it's that a collaborative search for answers is in itself a beautiful thing."
The Good Place,1,'The Good Place' has recovered from all the doubts it could have generated during a stretch of this fourth and last season. [Full review in Spanish]
The Good Place,1,"After a bit of a muddled end to season three, The Good Place began moving all of the pieces into place for the final season with an excellent opener to season 4."
The Good Place,1,A gentle emotional roller coaster.
The Good Place,1,"All in all, I'm extremely excited for the next episode, and for a season that has simplified things back to the best parts of The Good Place: goofs and ethics."
The Good Place,1,"All of this, played through The Good Place's deceptively delicate hilarity, makes Michael's unflagging optimism seem slightly frayed around the edges... not that that's a bad thing."
The Good Place,1,... I find myself deeply invested in: Jason v. Derek! Everything about it fascinates me.
The Good Place,1,"More than anything, I am glad to have The Good Place's particular sense of humor back for one last go-round."
The Good Place,1,"The show has made me a better person for a different reason, because I do believe in is the show's real message - that we owe it to each other to create a better life right now."
The Good Place,1,"One of the strongest, funniest, most delightfully weird network sitcoms of the decade kicks off its final season by getting back to basics."
The Good Place,1,"It's always a good sign to me when a series returns to its core for a final season, and season four of The Good Place is clearly doing just that."
The Good Place,1,"I have no doubt that Chidi can solve the puzzle, now more than ever."
The Good Place,1,"It's The Good Place at its best, using a moral dilemma to force its dysfunctional cast of characters to work together, and cutting what could be a saccharine moral with barbed jokes and startling twists."
The Good Place,1,"It's a promising start to the latest phase of this unpredictable gem, even as I'm eager to be done with set-up and dive into whatever strange ideas Schur and company have for us farther down the line."
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place season 4 premiere ""A Girl From Arizona Part One"" seems likely to be among the worst episodes of this final season. It's also, of course, utterly fantastic."
The Good Place,1,"While The Good Place Season 4 Episode 1 wasn't the strongest season premiere, it was a fun episode that served as a catalyst for events that The Good Place Season 4 will surely undergo."
The Good Place,1,"The Good Place is letting loose a real, completely un-endearing asshole in the Good Place, and it's going to be interesting to see how, or if, he can be integrated into the show's world."
The Good Place,1,"That's to be expected of a 20-minute introductory episode that sets up a final season. And, while the best episodes of The Good Place are the ones that give the characters more breathing space, the show continues to be utterly delightful television."
The Good Place,1,"Nothing in The Selection, though, is as funny as in this week's episode when the demons sing the Bad Place anthem: the ""1-877-Kars-4-Kids"" jingle."
The Good Place,1,"Maybe no good comes from our good intentions, maybe a glowing little firebug of light makes it down to a person in need. What matters is what you do with the time that you've got, and ""The Good Place"" put a lot of good into this world."
The Good Place,1,The characters continue to grow and you'd think in a show that is so absurd that you wouldn't have such deep rooted and emotional character growth but you absolutely do...I will miss it dearly but I am so glad to have had it.
The Good Place,1,"In other words, as great as this show is, it's probably about time to bring it in for a landing before we wind up on Jupiter or in the 1800s or inside the body of a shark."
The Good Place,1,The Good Place is the best series about ethics in the history of television.
The Good Place,1,"The critical darling comedy's last run is jam-packed with all the creativity, wit and heart that have made the series a beloved fan favorite."
The OA,1,Episode 41: Best of 2019 So Far
The OA,1,"[The OA] manages to be stranger, more puzzling and even more addictively demented than the first season."
The OA,1,"We'll cut to the chase. The OA Part II is a bad show when Prairie is onscreen. But! The OA is a good show when it focuses on a completely different narrative, a good old-fashioned formulaic Law & Order-type story."
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
The OA,1,"The last episode of The OA spoke to me...I felt a wave of emotion, actually moved to tears because in that moment I saw that we are all looking for our purpose..."
The OA,1,"The OA is kind of genius, while simultaneously being incredibly silly. And you know what? I love it! I love its goofy, loopy vibe."
The OA,1,"The sequence with Old Night is what The OA does best. At first the scene is stunning, almost laughable, in its sheer oddity, but then the mood morphs, as it pulsates with existential terror and a sort of unnerving sexuality."
The OA,1,"What makes the Nob Hill arc unique is that it offers a thought-provoking dive into the sci-fi realm, and goes beyond ghosts and jump-scares to encourage viewers to think while providing an unpredictable journey."
The OA,1,"The OA Part II was better than one could have ever imagined, its ingenuity and trust in its audience, coupled by the brilliant execution of its power duo, brought the series to new heights."
The OA,1,"Marling and Batmanglij have created an intriguing universe, populated with sympathetic and real characters. Ultimately rewarding, The OA makes you feel proud to be TV viewer."
The OA,1,"Season 2 not only gives all the returning characters great material, but also finds room to introduce Karim (Kingsley Ben-Adir), the PI who brings a much-needed audience viewpoint - and an immediate likability - to the show."
The OA,1,"This series has never been meant for everyone, but for those who are true believers in the OA, Part II will be a welcome follow-up to the first."
The OA,1,Watching it feels like being immersed in an interactive experience while taking psychedelics.
The OA,1,I wish more television was this unafraid to leave its audience fumbling for understanding.
The OA,0,Annoying. Gripping. But annoying.
The OA,1,"The show is ambitious and wholly original, and pulled no punches with its sophomore season on Netflix."
The OA,1,"It is probably a sign of how well-mannered the fanbase of The OA is that in the three days it took for me to finish it, no one said a word about its objectively insane ending."
The OA,1,"It's with great joy that I can say that The OA's second season, which took nearly three years to complete, takes the seeds planted in the show's first eight episodes and lets them blossom into something close to a masterpiece."
The OA,1,"The second season continues to blur genres, jump into surprise directions, and thrill in its visual palette, but an air of pretension, and the occasional baffling moment, holds the show back from entirely resonating on an emotional level."
The OA,1,"I loved it. I did not expect 2019 to be the year The OA went from a show I ironically tell people to watch if they plan on doing mescaline to a genuinely joyful, wildly worth-it ride through what-the-hecksville."
The OA,1,"The performances are so solid, the commitment to its kooky worldview so earnest, and the smorgasbord of sci-fi curlicues so endearing, sacrificing your expectations of plausibility feels like a worthwhile price of admission..."
The OA,1,"The OA: Part II packs each frame so dense with detail, that not one second of the new season's more-than-eight-hour runtime seems wasted, expositional, cheap, or unearned."
The OA,1,"The OA reminds us it's natural to feel out of place, and tries to instill a little faith in what's to come. More, it wants us to really feel our feelings about it without the cover of jokes or irony."
The OA,1,"This new season is even more ambitious than the first, tackling some heady concepts and delving into truly bizarre and mind-bending territory."
The OA,1,The OA truly comes into its own when you stop attempting to piece together the storyline and instead submit to Marling and Batmanglij's vision.
The OA,1,This show is such a strange gift.
The OA,1,Just when you think you know what's going to happen next... something else completely different happens.
The OA,1,"Forty-two minutes into the 65-minute premiere, you'll get the answers you've been waiting for since 2016."
The OA,1,"Ben-Adir is great here, with his seen-it-all shrug and effortless cool, and his presence gives us a viewer surrogate who's just as confused and exasperated by all this pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo as we are."
The OA,1,"The only thing I'm sure of when it comes to The OA is that the process of watching and experiencing an episode is unlike the viewing of any other show on TV and, good or bad, there's value in that."
The OA,0,"Events, characters and half-formed ideas are thrown at the screen then abandoned in favour of fresh mysteries, the show infinitely rolling out a carpet of kookiness."
The OA,1,This isn't another Lost. There is method in The OA's madness.
The OA,1,"This time it feels worth it. And it turns out, if you were one of the viewers who believed, who left that door open for The OA all these years, you might have welcomed some bonafide, baffling magic into your home."
The OA,1,There are moments in Part II that are so visually and conceptually bold... There are other moments that skirt so close to the pretentious and ridiculous that they made me think I might actually transform into the eye-roll emoji.
The OA,1,"It's hard not to appreciate the grand scale of what Marling and Batmanglij are attempting to do, even if it's difficult at times to discern what, exactly, that's supposed to be."
The OA,1,"It's compelling -- or at least it is once it gets going -- but it's a very different beast to season one, swapping out ambiguity for hard sci-fi fantasy."
The OA,1,You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll cry from laughing or simply stare blankly at the screen as some of the weirdest s--- you've ever seen unfolds...
The Order,1,"The Order Season 2 is a suspenseful and thrilling good time, albeit with a few frustrating plot points."
The Order,1,The climactic story keeps you not only wanting to hurry up and reveal itself but leave you panting for more.
The Order,1,"What makes The Order season 2 a superior follow-up is how obviously it recognizes which aspects of the show work best; it's rife with knowing humor, fun character pairings, and imaginative twists on its established mythology."
The Order,1,"The struggle between Midnight and Silverback was as compelling as always, however, and credit must be given for The OrderÂ's continuing ability to make MidnightÂ's new champion, Gabrielle, simultaneously obnoxious and sympathetic at the same time."
The Order,1,"All in all, it is a pretty solid, enjoyable season that demonstrates The Order is still capable of balancing drama and comedy really well."
Godless,0,"In Godless, we see a black town, literally called Blackdom, and its inhabitants as ""others..."" Think that's bad? Native American characters do not do better"
Godless,0,"If genre cliches are brought into a work to be deconstructed, but said cliches remain stylized and centered, then what's actually being upended in this process?"
Godless,1,I can definitely appreciate Scott Frank and Steven Soderberg tackling this particular untouched (in terms of Hollywood) subject matter.
Godless,0,"It shows, in a bad way, that the original material was designed for a short film format, and you can tell that there was no script to fill the more than seven hours that the miniseries lasts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Godless,1,Godless reveals there are still plenty of ways to make the Western seem fresh and exciting.
Godless,1,"Godless is a work of confident artistry, casting well-worn clichés and archetypes in a fresh, illuminating light."
Godless,0,"Godless is an almighty letdown. The narrative is as expansive as the vast New Mexico plains that form its backdrop, but there's too much creative tumbleweed."
Godless,1,"Gritty, grimy and, at times, pretty grim, Godless is nevertheless filled with some terrific performances, a luscious T Bone Burnett soundtrack, gripping tension and some memorable dialogue."
Godless,1,"As events unfold across seven hours certain storylines might proceed a little languidly for some tastes, but things are anchored by some terrific performances, particularly from Wever and from McNairy."
Godless,1,"It's a great series: An old-fashioned Western revenge flick drawn out over seven splendid hours. The cinematography is gorgeous, it's well-plotted, and the actressin' is phenomenal all around"
Godless,1,Scoot McNairy brings aching vulnerability to the role of emotionally tortured sheriff Bill McNue.
Godless,1,"It's a well acted, gritty, dusty, uber-violent and actually clandestinely old-fashioned mash-up of all the great Westerns you ever knew and loved."
Godless,0,"There are interesting ideas and some refreshing roles here, languorously trailed among the endless vistas. But these ideas flare and subside in the slow sprawl of the show, without the assurance of a guiding hand."
Godless,0,"The show is filled with unnecessary rapes, voyeuristic violence against women, and frivolous female nudity."
Godless,1,"For those who were looking forward to binge-watching a Western series on Netflix created by accomplished American auteurs, well... it's time they got around to watching Godless."
Godless,1,"For a show that promises plenty of badass women gunslingers, the show offers the same archetypal male drama we've seen before."
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
Godless,1,Godless has all the traditional components of the western: landscapes and pistols. And a lot of quality behind the scenes. [Full Review in Spanish]
Godless,1,"Godless doesn't change the game, but it definitely scratches the itch for fans of Westerns, world building and myth construction storytelling."
Godless,1,"Godless offers compelling drama, combining a number of intriguing storylines with its classic tale of a good-hearted fugitive pursued by a vicious gang."
Godless,1,"A visual stunner packed with rip-roaring characters and classic Western elements, ""Godless"" is a veritable bonanza of frontier fun."
Godless,1,"Scott Frank's western, focused on an 1880s town populated mainly by women, is a great pleasure."
Godless,1,"Even though Godless certainly employs some familiar genre tropes and scenes of violence and romance, it still manages to surprise and subvert expectations in unique ways."
Godless,0,"Godless is so swept up in the romance of the West that it shortchanges practically everything else -- character, context, story."
Godless,1,"Godless certainly doesn't do much to subvert genre clichs... But then, westerns were never about pushing boundaries - they were about entertainment, and Godless has that in abundance."
Godless,1,"So-so Western is well-acted, but moves at a snail's pace."
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
Godless,1,Unrelentingly brilliant.
Godless,1,The landscapes are bleakly arresting and the violence when it comes is suitably chilling.
Godless,1,For all the shock that Godless squeezes out of just how far Frank is willing to go-and how far the amiable star playing him is willing to push himself-the show uses its seven often hour-long-plus episodes carefully.
Godless,1,"Godless left me empty, despite its abundance of great talent...The most compelling thing about Godless may be the gender dynamics simmering in the background."
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
Godless,1,"In Godless's case, there's not much to disappoint you just yet. The show falls very, very, very squarely within the confines of its genre."
Godless,1,The baby steps Godless takes in unpacking its maleness from a premise of matriarchy makes it obvious just how far the genre has to go.
Godless,1,"This is a show that really loves the earth, even if it doesn't embrace the country - it knows what American can be at its best and what it is at its worst."
Godless,1,"True to form, Godless gives us a sex worker, but she's not an accessory. She's retired, and, financially speaking, she's the most powerful woman in the narrative, which makes sense."
Godless,1,"While the Western didn't fully capitalize on its promised premise (despite some rather noble attempts during the runtime), it still manages to weave its own unique tapestry of violence and sadness."
Godless,1,"As the inevitable showdown draws closer and closer, we spend enough time with all parties to understand them as people rather than stereotypes."
Godless,1,There's something about the grim beauty of Godless and its first-rate cast that makes me want to take my time with it.
Godless,1,"The result is a series that feels both traditional and new, with the big-screen qualities of a film and the story and character nuance of the best serialized television. This last is exploited to best advantage by Frank's cast."
Godless,1,"If Godless is the result of Netflix's wild content spending spree, may the well never dry up, my friends."
Godless,1,"... it proves that truer stories can be told-ones that capture the allure of what brought so many westward in the the first place, while more honestly portraying history."
Godless,1,No Netflix drama has been this lyrical and yet crisply understated: expect it to triumph at next year's Emmys.
Godless,1,"For as much as Griffin's prophecy hang over the show, Godless expands in many different directions over its seven-episode sprawl"
Godless,1,"Godless doesn't reinvent the wagon wheel, but it gets a few good spins out of trusty Western standbys in its too-long seven-hour run."
Godless,1,I'm a sucker for the stories of justice and revenge at the heart of most good Westerns. And I love it even more when those stories recognize the social realities of the time. Godless does all that and more.
Godless,1,"Attention is paid to each character's nuances and shortcomings, as an emotional storm builds up to a fine example of a wild West showdown."
Godless,0,"Godless foregrounds by-the-book gunslingers and manhunts that take a promising concept and translate it into familiar, if handsomely presented, clich."
Godless,1,"A seven-hours-plus honest-to-gosh western created by writer-director Scott Frank, Godless features cowboys on horses, lots of shootin' and ropin', and a feminist twist so thoroughly integrated into the premise, no ornery dude can possibly complain."
Godless,0,"My biggest complaint about Godless is one that could have been avoided entirely, had Frank only realized that if he'd concentrated less on hitting the more basic beats of Westerns, he could explore one hell of a more interesting story buried underneath."
Godless,1,The result is an endlessly watchable limited series that is a magnificent addition to the Western genre and one of the best and most surprising offerings from Netflix in recent memory.
Godless,1,Godless delivers. And it's both smart and entertaining in the process.
Godless,1,Not since Lonesome Dove have I had such a good time cheering on -- and worrying over -- such an engaging gallery of heroes.
Godless,1,"Don't get me wrong--Godless is a spectacular show, and well worth watching...But still, it feels like a missed opportunity to have built up the conceit of a ""no man's land"" ruled by women, and fail to deliver on the feminism."
Godless,1,... odless is clever in both its approach and its focus...
Godless,1,"It feels nearly impossible to shake-up the genre, which I grew up watching thanks to my father, who is absolutely obsessed with throwback-ish style. And, yet, Netflix's new series Godless manages to do just that."
Godless,1,"If you're thinking about hte gender politics of the show, consider how each of the major characters is introduced... the men are weak and injured, while the women are strong."
Godless,1,"Godless is grim, exciting and visually arresting. It's slow, but necessarily so, patiently offering vital exposition while its classic, western plot unfurls itself violently."
Godless,1,"I can tell you that I did not want to curse my television, and that ""Godless,"" the grimness of its title notwithstanding, goes somewhere almost corny, but kind of beautiful."
Godless,1,"Brutal, unforgiving, and warmly nostalgic; Netflix's grand Western is one of 2017's most satisfying shows."
Godless,1,"It gets way more right than wrong as an outstanding cast, memorable characters, engaging arcs, beautiful shots of the majestic frontier, and one hell of a finale (oh yes, it's pretty savage) bring us a uniquely bewitching and exciting story."
Godless,1,"It's an operatic, juicy drama that thrives by earnestly embracing the best -and side-stepping the worst - Western tropes."
Godless,1,The storytelling excesses created by this format make it more fun than the traditional movie version probably would have been.
Godless,1,"Buoyed by strong performances and its knowing embrace of an under-utilized genre, this seven-part event slows in the middle but yields the kind of home stretch for which it's worth giving thanks."
Godless,1,"If he (Scott Frank) doesn't achieve the visual or narrative poetry of the filmmakers he's riffing on -- the John Fords, Howard Hawkses and Robert Altmans -- he still gives you plenty to look at, and it's never boring."
Godless,1,"There's great acting to be found, and some thoughtful writing-and if you like sweeping panoramas of the sun setting across an untamed wild, then you're in excellent, if heavy, hands."
Godless,1,"Every frame is breathtaking in its own way, whether it's of dust carried on the wind (a classic, tumbleweed-style indication that the characters are remote and exposed) or sun pouring through the slats of an old, dilapidated barn."
Godless,1,"Indeed, the only major issue with Godless as a thoughtful and engaging entertainment is that you're constantly aware that it could have been so much more than that."
Godless,1,"Every moment counts, making for an overall experience as to-the-point as Mary Agnes herself. Even when it appears to be taking some extra time for itself, ""Godless"" isn't wasting a second."
Godless,1,"If you're a sucker for Westerns, boy, are you going to love Godless. If you're not a sucker for Westerns, boy, are you going to love Godless anyway."
Godless,1,"The sun will never fully set on the Western, because it is the story of us, and, as great Westerns like Godless prove, a story that is far more complicated -- and far more relevant to our own time -- than white hats versus black hats."
Godless,1,"If you love Westerns, this is definitely one to try. If you don't, check it out anyway; it's very likely to seduce you."
Godless,1,Godless might remind you of HBO's still lamented Deadwood in its expert plotting. Those dusty winds swirl around bloody secrets.
Godless,1,"Godless is beautiful. Whether you have a love of westerns or not, the blue skies of New Mexico are fully utilized with the dusty, sprawling landscapes that were once the cornerstone of the American West."
Godless,1,"Godless keeps its world as expansive as the vast plains, so beautifully shot on location in Santa Fe. The supporting cast s strong, but no one is more electric than the always extraordinary Merritt Wever."
Godless,1,Godless is the Western you've been waiting for.
Godless,1,"It's a big, brave western, culturally penetrating and entertaining in way that makes you savour scenes and dialogue, rather than anticipating the next jolt."
Godless,0,"In Godless, female empowerment resembles the adoption of a rigid construction of masculinity."
Godless,0,Godless has a great throwback Western movie buried somewhere under all the excess flab.
Godless,1,It's the best Western of 2017 and it's absolutely one of the best uses of longform narrative to tell what is essentially an expanded movie.
Love,1,"In short, it could be described as a modern fairytale. [Full review in Spanish]"
Love,1,"Love may not entirely stick the landing in its final, crucial episodes, but its winsome characters and endearing manner still leave enough to wholeheartedly recommend."
Love,1,"Even when Netlifx evolves into a tiny chip, planted into the brains of our descendants on a space colony somewhere, the story captured in the three seasons of Love will still resonate. These are truths that will never disappear."
Love,1,"Even though it goes a little overboard at times in terms of pleasing the audience with a litany of happy endings for its talented ensemble, it's overall an entertaining and relatively speedy binge-watch that bids farewell to a charming and unlikely tale."
Love,1,"The most irritating thing about Love might be also what makes it genius. Season 3 continues to make viewers a participant in this relationship, whether they like it or not."
Love,1,"Season 3 does manage to end on something of a transcendent moment while remaining as semi-sweet as what's come before, and we'll always remember the show with fondness."
Love,1,"Ultimately, Love sits head and shoulders above its rom-com contemporaries because viewers can see themselves in Gus and Mickey, despite how awful they can be."
Love,1,"Love never reached beyond everyday scenarios the normal viewer could identify with without trying. For the most part, those humble efforts yielded charming rewards."
Love,1,"If Mickey and Gus don't remind you of passionate or frightening or warm moments in relationships you've had, you're a cold fish indeed."
Love,1,"Love manages to close on its own terms, on an unconventionally hopeful note. But it also provides something that most of us seek but don't often find from our television shows: a couple of genuine surprises we didn't see coming."
Love,1,"Love's swan song amounts to a leisurely final lap that may not be as powerful and eye-opening as its first two seasons, but it's a season that feels like the natural progression of everything that's come before."
Top Boy,1,"Top Boy is an ongoing masterpiece, the kind of show that will make your day and ruin your whole night."
Top Boy,1,When Ashley Walters’ Dushane growls ‘we got a problem’ you know he means serious business.
Top Boy,1,"It’s all bleak, but it’s also riveting."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,"The series expertly provides visibility and representation for LGBTQ+, neurodiverse, and racially diverse youth."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,... Takes that embrace of representation farther than we’ve ever seen it — and then doesn’t make a big deal of it.
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,This animated series sees trans people for everything they are—not just as trans people. And it has so much joy and fun while doing it.
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,"Without shows like Steven Universe, She-Re and the Princesses of Power, and The Owl House, Netflix’s Dead End likely wouldn’t exist or be anywhere near as able to be the big-hearted, emotionally intelligent, all-ages romp that it is."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,"Beyond issues of importance and representation, is the show good? Yes, though it’s not on the same level as other silly-spooky story-driven cartoons like Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and The Owl House."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,Dead End: Paranormal Park is easily one of the best animated shows of the year so far. It is a fun supernatural adventure with a huge heart.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's bleakly funny but things take a more serious turn in season two, when Alyssa is left managing the aftermath of the pair's crime spree and a new psychopath enters the mix."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The End of the ****ing World season 2 predictably doesn't have the same manic energy or sense of revelation as the first go-around, but it retains the pitch-black nihilism and expert situational humor - it might even be funnier"
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The second season... is a bummer because it's not as good as the first season, but more detrimentally, it undoes the perfection that is the first season. Other than that, though, it's a moderately entertaining three hours."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"A fine show, shot through with smart decisions, pitch-perfect performances and moments of real comic brilliance."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Albeit the second (and most likely final) season of The End of the F***ing World isn't as impactful or satisfying as its daring predecessor, it's a harmless epilogue that sketches a creamy outcome for these perturbed characters."
The End of the F...ing World,1,It has the same gonzo tone and darkly funny writing.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"...an epilogue that ends not far from where it began and doesn't connect as well as the original story. It is, however, honest about the gas pockets we can hit while mining past trauma as we attempt to better understand ourselves and connect..."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"These kids win my heart and make me guffaw. Please, BBC/Netflix, don't make a third season. I want to walk away and always remember Alyssa and James in their awful, tentative, f***ed-up glory."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"How do you describe a television show that's unlike any other? To oversimplify it, ""The End of the F***ing World,"" is a pitch-black comedy about a pair of troubled 17-year-olds who meet and fall in love in a very unconventional way."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"This second season is darker, more violent, more bloody and more explicit than the first one, but it also has more humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
The End of the F...ing World,1,Teen noir with savage class. Kids will love it.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The End of the F***ing World is crafted and presented with gorgeous colour and detail, allowing you to soak up every part of this electrifying story."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The End of the F***ing World is designed for binge culture. Watch it all at once, and watch it now. You won't regret it."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"In its second series, the show has morphed into a different, less anarchic and explosive experience - but it is richer for it."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Altogether, it oozes ""not for everyone""; although despite that, I think it might be."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The End of the F***ing World costumes help enhance the unease between James and Alyssa, a visual metaphor for how close they could be, and yet how different their respective outlooks are two years on."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"While the second season doesn't exactly feel necessary, it's still fun to take another aimless ride with the show's resident weirdos and see where we end up."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Season 2 brings with it the same shock-value, stunning visuals, and sheer madness, with Alyssa (Jessica Barden) and James (Alex Lawther) back for another round of intense Bonnie and Clyde style drama."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Once again, it's a story about the light that slips through the cracks in broken hearts; this time, the light may not be quite as dazzling, but it's absolutely still worth capturing."
The End of the F...ing World,1,The End of the F***cking World season two proves that a bit of fan service doesn't mean the death of good storytelling.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Darker by necessity, this new season still finds the show's signature humor and heart intact."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The new episodes share many of the original batch's most effective elements -- strong performances, deft retro soundtrack choices (leaning more on folk this time), a blend of humor and pathos -- without ever finding a reason to exist."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's an astonishingly nihilistic series, gorgeously made, and for all its macabre humour, very moving."
The End of the F...ing World,0,"Forcing more drama onto them after they've left only feels forced. It's a lose-lose scenario, and while I'll always contend there's a good way to keep telling many stories, this isn't it."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's a dizzyingly intense tour through guilt, trauma, and ultimately hope."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Barden and Lawther's performances, down to their telling inner-dialogue, are tactful and poignant in portraying their issues that are a lot tougher than a case of teen angst."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Close to two years and dozens of teen shows later, the series returns matured, the pacing slower, the tone darker."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's all still amusing, and the notes of strangled romanticism and just-perceptible nobility are still in place. But the plot doesn't have the momentum and the crazy energy it did the first time around."
The End of the F...ing World,0,"If the first season came across as an update on Natural Born Killers, the second begins with a very strong Kill Bill vibe. Unfortunately, it's a vibe the season can't sustain."
The End of the F...ing World,1,[Jessica] Barden and [Alex] Lawther excel; their characters perfectly toeing the line between being haunted by their pasts - both are subsequently more awkward and angry around one another - and confused teenage chemistry.
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Shot and styled with flair, it is depraved nihilism made to look cool and it is up to you whether that makes the show objectionable or a dark thrill-ride. Either way, it is exactly why the kids will love it."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"The result was bleak but dry, wry and hopelessly romantic, like Badlands relocated to Seventies suburbia. The series is stripped across the schedules for four nights, promising to surprise and beguile as much as the first."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"It's the pace that makes it sing. Of course there were some manoeuvres to pull off, to bring all of the characters back into the fray, but it has been done with as little clumsiness as possible."
The End of the F...ing World,1,"Lawther also is reliably excellent and conveys grief, confusion and, yes, some joy, in equally revelatory ways. Ackie is equally sure-handed in making Bonnie a compelling compilation of damaged, naive, sad and lethal."
The End of the F...ing World,1,Season 2 tells a new story that maintains the offbeat rhythm and peculiar style that made the first run a cult hit.
Narcos,1,"With four crime bosses to follow instead of one, the storyline teeters just this side of cumbersome, but credit goes to the writers who create clear distinctions between each of these bad guys."
Narcos,1,"Don't kid yourself: This season... [is] as vicious as the ones before, even if the Cartel's moves are more gracefully plotted."
Narcos,1,Keeping Pascal was important in connecting the stories and keeping an interesting presence at the center of the series.
Narcos,1,Narcos gains something it never really had: an emotional throughline. This ratchets up the tension considerably.
Narcos,1,Losing a protagonist changes a series and Narcos is now even better. [Full Review in Spanish]
Narcos,1,"You won't exactly be saying ""Pablo who?"" in the wake of Wagner Moura's compelling performance as the murderous Medellin cartel boss across the first two seasons, but as the third begins Escobar's successors in the Cali cartel become similarly engrossing."
Narcos,1,"If television could imitate the overwhelmed feeling DEA agents likely felt approaching these cartels, this would be it. This season is intense, fast-paced, and a must watch."
Narcos,1,"The continuity provided by the theme music aside, Narcos Season 3 essentially functions as the start of a brand new series under the Narcos umbrella -- a backdoor anthology, if you will."
Narcos,1,"It's ridiculous, barbaric and cruel; it's also great entertainment."
Narcos,0,"For all the shake-ups in the cast and in the show's scope, Narcos is still Narcos."
Narcos,1,"An old clear-out might prove the show's smartest decision - opening the gateway for a variety of kingpin personalities, new characters and refined thrills which results in the most engaging season so far."
Narcos,1,"I find myself admiring Narcos' overall design all the same, even if the show will never be completely my thing."
Narcos,1,It eventually draws you into the family dynamics while ramping up the action.
Narcos,1,"The idea of a season 3 didn't feel inviting. But now, those premature doubts are all buried deep into the ground, much like Escobar's dirty money."
Narcos,1,Narcos is highly recommended as a terrific thriller and and a timely political parable.
Narcos,1,"All signs point to a solid season. I'll be along for the ride. You should be, too."
Narcos,1,"Someone give [Matias Varela​] an Emmy, please."
Narcos,1,"With history on its side, and as its table settling, Narcos somehow found a way to actually become better in its third season, without the crutch of Pablo Escobar in fact, by delivering a killer (real) premise and some augmented thrills."
Narcos,1,"[Narcos] is essentially a collection of hyperstylized historical reenactments. And yet, it is, right now, the best crime show on television."
Narcos,1,"By staying flexible and surprising, Narcos is earning a life longer than the reign of some of the drug lords it portrays."
Narcos,1,"If the characters have changed, Narcos has retained its raffish lustre."
Narcos,1,"Out from under the shadow of Pablo Escobar, Netflix's drug war drama has found an exciting new storyline to follow and it's all headed up by Pascal, who finally gets to play the series' leading man."
Narcos,1,The new season is still really quite good. I enjoyed it more than either of the first two seasons.
Narcos,1,"Pacho -- with his blow-dried hair and patterned silk shirts -- was always positioned as a softer, more polished foil to Pablo's bull-snorting machismo."
Narcos,1,"I think by the last of the six episodes I watched, I was more engaged than at any point in the first two seasons, despite the lack of Moura."
Narcos,1,"In his plight, Narcos proves a stinging portrait of the war on drugs as akin to stepping in quicksand: Best to avoid it altogether, because once you're in, you're in for good... until you've drowned."
Narcos,1,"I won't spoil his character's arc, but Salcedo becomes the show's stealth star and the main reason you stay on the couch watching every time the next episode automatically spins up."
Narcos,1,"Narcos wrapped up its Pablo Escobar storyline in two terrific seasons, raising the question of what the show could possibly do for an encore without Wagner Moura in that role. The answer, it turns out, was to splendidly hit the reset button."
Narcos,1,This tactical shift changes the nature of Narcos significantly in season 3 from the hunt of a single terror into the quixotic quest to destroy a violent network that begets other savage networks in other countries.
Narcos,1,"It is one of the great examples of shows that have improved thanks to the opportunity to grow and evolve, and Season 3 continues that journey with an investment in human storytelling."
Narcos,1,"If you ever needed proof that television is the new gold standard of storytelling, look no further than Narcos. Season 3 is not only the best installment of the series to date, but it's also a thrilling, white-knuckle ride."
Narcos,1,"Season three seizes the vacuum left by Escobar as an opportunity to bring an intricate, thrilling and ultimately depressing narrative to the fore. Its craft is reminiscent of The Wire's latter seasons."
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
Safe,0,There are few series on streaming or anywhere else that will cause as few ripples.
Safe,1,"The ensemble cast makes it all click. There are plenty of moments in Safe where the story and its twists threaten to derail the tightly wound mayhem, but the cast saves it from ever tipping over."
Safe,1,"Still, this is a British mystery made for TV, and the form is a winner, despite some overwrought music that supplies more tension than the script calls for."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
Safe,1,We have to talk about that accent.
Safe,1,"All in all, it's good, soapy fun. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, you're likely to get swept up in its current, and once that happens, I'd wager that all eight episodes will safely disappear in a flash."
Safe,1,"Safe does promise plenty of twists and turns for loyal mystery lovers, and the supporting cast, including Sherlock's Amanda Abbington, is extremely capable."
Safe,1,Cliche-free British crime drama is great grown-up mystery.
Safe,0,"It can whirr on, in its mechanical way, without me."
Safe,1,"It's really rather good, and both Hall and Abbington are superb to watch, fine actors adding texture to the wildly twisted plotting and the gusty dialogue that would make many actors knackered."
Safe,1,"Finding out why they are so guarded, and where all the bodies (figuratively and literally) are buried, is what makes this series a potential binge candidate."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
Safe,1,"Excellent acting all round; twisty plot that holds your attention; even better than ""The Five"" and that means it is superb TV viewing. Worth the bingewatching thrill."
Safe,0,"Skip it, unless you're a Hall or Coben completist. It just feels like the twists aren't going to be nearly as twisty as Coben thinks they're going to be."
Safe,1,Safe is... top-quality TV drama.
Safe,1,"With committed performances (some of which are clearly aware of the ludicrous story they're in) and a brisk pace, Safe earns its status as a soapy pleasure and should entertain Netflix viewers craving engaging distraction."
Safe,1,"I'm very much enjoying these people, without really caring about them."
Safe,1,"Almost everything about Safe, from the acting to the dialogue, is pulpy with a vengeance."
Safe,1,"There's nothing particularly fresh about it, but it does what it sets out to do - to keep the viewer guessing who dunit and why - with assurance and flair."
Safe,1,Those who enjoyed Broadchurch and Doctor Foster should definitely check out Netflix's latest British thriller Safe...
Safe,1,Boasts a quality cast and slick script [and] brings a tone of nightmarish slapstick.
Safe,0,"[Michael C.] Hall's accent, reasonably consistent and yet rarely believable, is one of many things on Safe that are askew and, the more I think about it, the more I can't tell if it's intentional if not particularly satisfying, or merely bad."
Safe,1,Generally delivers the kinds of well-paced twists that mystery fans are likely to enjoy.
Ginny & Georgia,1,"It was fun and quick and interesting and I found myself just as intrigued with the adults' storylines as the teens' storylines, which is a rare find for me. It's imperfect, of course, but it was a fast, fun watch."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The body of the series is a bantery young-adult soap, the head a woman-on-the-edge thriller, and the tail a race melodrama. The creator, Sarah Lampert, must have looked upon her handiwork with proud amusement."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"This manic, mystery-fueled mother-daughter drama reels in viewers with more sex, drugs, and violence in the first episode than we saw in seven seasons of the Gilmore Girls."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny and Georgia has its fair share issues, but it handles teen sexuality without preaching or condemning and offers a path where sex doesn't have to mean much at all."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Whether or not Ginny & Georgia is ""good"" depends heavily on how many edibles you've consumed before watching. Wellsbury is certainly not Stars Hollow."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The script's plotholes... [starts] so many stories that, in the dent, it doesn't end up providing the screen time that each one deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Howey and Gentry are great both together and separately, the show's twisting plots are addictive and soapy without being too implausible, and there's a thoughtfulness in its approach to issues of race, sexuality and parenting. I kinda loved it."
Ginny & Georgia,0,Ginny & Georgia isn't the new 'Gilmore Girls.' It's a mess...
Ginny & Georgia,1,"There were some very funny moments, but they mostly involved the supporting characters."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Gentry's sensitive performance shoulders the weight of Ginny & Georgia, and she wears her character's excitement, hope and pain with a heartbreaking lightness."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny is living a teen drama, while Georgia has a closet full of skeletons in a thriller mystery. Somehow these two lanes work to tell a compelling story about family, the secrets we keep, and the truth that we may all become our parents eventually."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Lampert, Fisher, and company are at their best when writing for Ginny, and Gentry doesn't miss a beat."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Surprisingly, it pretty much all works. The dark secrets (there are many) balance with the apparent fluff, making for an engaging, never-dull series. Maybe the Gilmore Girls should have had guns."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is perfect background TV: familiar enough to be comforting, but with enough of its own weird energy to let Netflix's autoplay jump into the next episode."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Plot-wise, G&G delivers. Good trash-plotting is like a river in full spate. A lot rushes past you, it all feels Very Dramatic (although, unlike a river, mostly because of the way it is scored) and you feel like the source will never run dry."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"The whole package may be dubiously conceived and overstuffed, but there's enough going on that some of it can't help but work."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Unfortunately, the show's ambitions for bigger stakes mean trading in some of the character-based intimacy that is the series' calling card. Go big or go home, they say - but Ginny & Georgia makes a strong case for staying cozy."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"It won't all make sense in the moment, but it settles well enough after 10 episodes. Even the predictability nets out to an enjoyable binge, and the finale has potential to actual surprise us in the future."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia wants us to love the way that Georgia always manages to stay one step ahead... Instead, I kept hoping that Child Protective Services would finally catch up."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny's very real world and Georgia's very heightened one might both be fun, but because the former is much more successful and better executed, the latter starts to feel like marking time."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is a step beyond Gilmore Girls; it is a better reflection of the world today. Ginny & Georgia is bolder and filled with more diverse, authentic characters that will capture your heart."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"It's loads of fun watching Georgia the scammer in action, and there's always more room for diverse teen stories that aren't weird about things like sexuality and mental illness."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia has its moments, but I'm not sure when dark became today's 'fresh and modern.' A little too dark for teens."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"This is an alternative, fresh take on Gilmore Girls. It's a welcome, wild and dark remake - a modern reimagining."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"Ginny & Georgia is still a fun watch, but if you temper your expectations before watching, then you'll probably be able to enjoy it more."
Ginny & Georgia,1,"The result is a show that is so overstuffed it cannot successfully service each of its storylines in a satisfying way. Fortunately, the show remains immensely watchable regardless"
Ginny & Georgia,1,There's also one area where Ginny & Georgia has a clear leg up on its predecessor: It understands from the jump that it's not especially healthy to have a mom who wants to be your best friend and is reluctant to fully grow up herself.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia seems to have something interesting to say about female beauty standards and the suffocating constrictions of the patriarchy, but it gets jumbled among all the other things the show is trying to be."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"There's a decent YA show in here somewhere, but along with its abundance of plot, Ginny & Georgia needs to step away from the plethora of Gilmore Girls references to get there."
Feel Good,1,"I felt about this season very similarly to the way I felt about the first: extremely uncomfortable. Martin is a charming performer, but it’s hard to watch someone continually refuse to get the help they need..."
Feel Good,1,"It’s both subtle and not, never shying away from depictions of queer sex or the long-lasting effects of trauma. The result is a show so good you almost can’t believe it exists, let alone that we were blessed with two seasons of it."
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good may not be everyone's piping-hot mug of kombucha, but there's grit, honesty and a daring kind of silliness here."
Feel Good,1,"Things get real tough but never too bleak. Devoted girlfriend George (Charlotte Ritchie) and goofy housemate Phil (Phil Burgers) provide loads of laughs and love, and mum Linda (Lisa Kudrow) a darkly surreal tinge. Outstanding television."
Feel Good,1,"The new episodes of Feel Good are on a par with the old ones -- textured, funny, a bit dramatic, and fitted with a clear theme: trauma and recovery from it."
Feel Good,1,"""Feel Good"" sends up a familiar brand of generational self-righteousness, but gently, with love."
Feel Good,1,"Season 2 of Feel Good gets darker and more uncomfortable without abandoning its humorous reprieves, a balance that allows it to cover an astonishing amount without feeling punishing."
Feel Good,1,"On one level it is one of the best recent LGBTQ dramedies to release anywhere, on another it's a great dramatic conduit for the moods of a generation grappling with mental health and identity."
Feel Good,1,The second and final season of Mae Martin and Joe Hampson's complicated romantic dramedy gets deeper and rougher - and still earns every laugh.
Feel Good,1,One of the most audacious things about the series is that it's committed to its love story. The show is romantic. The show is sexy. And that makes us understand Mae and George's hesitancy in taking the risk for something healthier.
Feel Good,1,The end result is 12 episodes of bittersweet comedic perfection.
Feel Good,1,Feel Good takes its final bow with a powerful season two of the topsy-turvy love story of George and Mae.
Feel Good,1,"The second season somehow amplifies the two extremes of the performance perfectly. Also improving on an already terrific turn is Ritchie, who benefits from George's very accurate realization that she needs to figure out a personality."
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is at its best when it sets its sights on bigger fish, such as cultural identity and our current obsession with labelling each other."
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good is a beautiful achievement, kind, human, as clever as it is funny."
Feel Good,1,"""Feel Good"" accomplishes so much in its tight six episodes that it's both a blessing and curse that it leaves the viewer wanting more."
Feel Good,1,"Throughout all these messy character and relationship arcs, there's still that goofy and original comedic voice established in the first season that sometimes verges on the absurd. Life is, after all, absurd. And [It] does a brilliant job exploring that."
Feel Good,1,"In both story and dialogue Martin and Hampson rarely take the easy route or the obvious joke or make sweeping statements. Something that might be easily mocked in a lesser show, is done so here without snark."
Feel Good,1,Ambitiously navigates modern love and identity with deep empathy and absurd humour.
Feel Good,1,"Feel Good season 2 is a wonderful 6 chapters, even if we do want more."
Feel Good,1,"There's a lot more going on, yet most of it works because the core characters were so well established in Season One. The George material in particular is a significant improvement."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
House of Cards,0,"Artistically, Season 6 of House of Cards is a flop."
House of Cards,0,"It isn't easy to replace Frank Underwood, who... has become one of the most legendary characters ever portrayed on a TV show. However, it is obvious that this season not only lacked inspiration - it was lacking, in general."
House of Cards,0,"The final season is not the glorious goodbye it should have been, or the one the show's best character and best actor deserved, but there's still enough of that early elegant cruelty to see it across the line."
House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.
House of Cards,0,This is the worst season of the series despite Robin Wright's best efforts. [Full Review in Spanish]
House of Cards,1,"From the first time Claire Underwood broke that fourth wall and looked directly at us at the end of season four beside her husband, we've been craving more insight into her equally manipulative mind."
House of Cards,1,"The sixth and last season of House of Cards is worth taking a peek at because, well, it's House of Cards and it put in the work to get where it is."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
House of Cards,0,"The final eight episodes, which are all available for streaming now on Netflix, comes to a messy conclusion with more loose ends than a Florida election ballot."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards...trashes itself, even if it was a sort of knowing trash to start with."
House of Cards,1,The new season of House of Cards doesn't feel like an arbitrary story overhaul in response to the #MeToo crisis. It feels right.
House of Cards,0,"The final season of House of Cards is too weird and atonal to ignore completely, but it's not good enough to recommend."
House of Cards,1,"Wright is truly stunning on the final season, and gives every second on screen her all in a way that suggests she's always known this should've been her show."
House of Cards,1,"House of Cards's sixth and final season really shines in the middle, when Claire is forced to defend every square inch of her presidency against the Shepherd family's abominable ambushes."
House of Cards,1,"Robin Wright has stepped sublimely up. She dominates by simply inhabiting, as did Francis, every scene in which she appears, and one sees the skull beneath the skin throughout, rather than in snatches."
House of Cards,1,"For a dying series, this feels remarkably alive with possibility."
House of Cards,1,Sadly just eight episodes! I'll miss Madame President's to die for tailored suits.
House of Cards,1,"The story of Season 6 just doesn't cohere; it barely even tracks well enough to summarize. In a way, the total breakdown is sort of beautiful; it's like watching the story collapse in upon itself, a deserted building, carefully demolished."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright is many things, but possessed of a light touch she is not."
House of Cards,0,What was once macabre is now mundane.
House of Cards,1,"Robin Wright is such a seasoned pro that she easily dominates the screen with her measured, observant take on the role."
House of Cards,1,"Dealt that bad hand, the ""Cards"" writers have responded with a truncated final season -- one that elevates Robin Wright's role her new Commander in Chief status, while still providing a window into the world of bare-knuckled political brawling."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on."
House of Cards,0,Season six is a web with no spider at the centre.
House of Cards,1,Audiences are left to wonder how things might have gone were this Robin Wright's show from the beginning.
House of Cards,0,"Plans, schemes, endgames -- who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more House of Cards lost its touch."
House of Cards,1,The king is dead; long live the queen. That is the mantra for the sixth and final season of Netflix's House Of Cards.
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
House of Cards,1,It looks and sounds like great drama. It smells like ham.
House of Cards,1,"The final season of House Of Cards touts consistent performances, specifically from Robin Wright, a sleek and elegant look, but still, there's the feeling of wanting more."
House of Cards,1,"Wright's performance reflects all of his cynicism, calculation and deep, unhealed wounds that powered his engine, and now hers as a President who pledges allegiance only to herself and her gender."
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
House of Cards,1,"Robin Wright coolly and assuredly handles Claire's newly appointed leading role, if only she can get out from under Frank's dead thumb."
House of Cards,1,The final season of House of Cards made me miss Kevin Spacey. It felt terrible.
House of Cards,1,The self-serious drama hasn't just morphed into a Ryan Murphy fantasy sequence; it appears to have thought more holistically about what promoting women should actually look like.
House of Cards,1,"In many ways, House of Cards has accidentally stumbled onto its perfect ending... Claire is the show's dark heart."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
House of Cards,0,"Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering."
House of Cards,1,"House of Cards is off to a much better start this season, thanks in large part to the notable subtraction and subsequent elevation of its stars, but it is still very much House of Cards, different in good ways but still the same in the bad ones."
House of Cards,0,"As the first made-to-binge show is finally over, we turn to its less high-falutin' spawn to release us from the chokeholds of binge-era mediocrity."
House of Cards,1,"Claire as the lead offers a different perspective, a worthy way to end a series that launched hundreds of other shows."
House of Cards,1,"While serving up a new batch of so-so operatives... to vex Claire, the best thing about the final episodes of ""House of Cards"" is the return of several ghosts of Underwood administrations past."
House of Cards,1,Claire's turn and she makes it count.
House of Cards,1,"Wright, who was always the show's secret superweapon anyway, seizes the spotlight as if by divine right, changing the energy of the entire piece."
House of Cards,1,"Their tense, hostile intimacy is a bit like Feud or Big Little Lies - a refreshing change from Spacey's egomaniacal, spotlight-hogging male energy."
House of Cards,1,Following Robin Wright through this season as she reveals Claire slowly and deliberately is worth a binge.
House of Cards,1,"Season six feels like a return to form, from its increasingly complex subplots to its overarching story, and much of its success has to do with Gibson and Pugliese's willingness to fully exploit the more nostalgic aspects of the entire run."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
House of Cards,1,"A closing chapter, without Spacey, allows the show its rightful final bow, unencumbered by scandal, and defined, in its finality, by a character far more complex and compelling than Spacey's Frank Underwood could ever have been."
House of Cards,1,"As always with House of Cards, though, the particulars of the intrigue are not as important as the people behind it. One of the chief delights of this season is the showcase it gives to actresses in their midlife prime."
House of Cards,1,"Cards maybe without its one-time King, but rather than folding, the creators have produced some real aces to deliver a winning, compelling, binge-worthy final hand."
House of Cards,1,"Nevertheless, with the show ostensibly in Wright's capable hands, the final season of House of Cards gets by just fine without Francis J. Underwood, and there's reason to think it's even better off without him."
House of Cards,1,"The one story line that towers over all others is the one about gender with Claire Underwood as president of the United States.. It makes the finale feel far more resonant, culturally important and compelling than I expected it to."
House of Cards,1,"Ultimately I liked it, because it was revision of a series that I once enjoyed very much that had been tainted by the action of an actor and how the political climate evolved. It felt familiar and felt like a good way to end the show on its own terms."
House of Cards,1,"As we saw last season, politics is faster than this now, an endless churn of scandal and grotesquery, and House Of Cards remains its own chilly, composed self."
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
House of Cards,0,"Despite the hype, Season 6 isn't Claire's show. It's still Frank's, which undercuts the season's many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant."
House of Cards,1,"Both in scope and detail, House of Cards remains impressive, and it probably goes without saying that both Lane and Kinnear are superb."
House of Cards,1,"House of Cards Season 6 is a bit of a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. And after investing five seasons in this show, it's one I'm happy exists."
House of Cards,1,"So House of Cards Season 6 is a must-watch. It's serving a bombastic, oversized, absurdist end to Netflix's first major original drama. And I'm okay with that."
House of Cards,1,"There's no questioning that this is {Wright's] show, and she has full command over it. That alone is reason to watch."
House of Cards,1,"The actions continues to play out like a chess match, but chess is not exactly a spectator sport."
House of Cards,1,The old show was one I've disliked for a long time. The newer show is one I can imagine missing. I wish there were some way the ties could have been severed immediately.
House of Cards,1,"A nicely labyrinthine plot means the season is far from a complete failure. But with Wright required to carry the entire enterprise, Netflix's first global hit looks set to limp into the sunset rather than triumphantly take its bows."
House of Cards,1,"In its final season, the Netflix drama, which now has Robin Wright in the lead, is the best it's been in years."
House of Cards,1,Robin Wright is so damn good at playing this character that I really wish they had found a better way to showcase her talents. House of Cards was a great show that turned into a good one. This final season is good but could have been great.
Stay Close,1,"Intense, compressed storytelling, crackling with twists and turns..."
Stay Close,1,"The series is superficial trash, yes, but lovingly polished trash. I couldn't stop watching."
Stay Close,1,"I’ll also say that I didn’t see the twist coming, which I suppose makes Stay Close a successful Coben series."
Stay Close,1,This series is good news for for Anglophiles who want to see something a bit different from the usual British crime drama.
Stay Close,1,"An entertaining drama full of flirting, thrills and familiar faces..."
Stay Close,1,Stay Close benefits from fine performances and a story that gives just enough clues in the first episode to keep viewers intrigued and - more importantly - not frustrated with purposely obtuse writing.
Stay Close,1,A perfect summer evening binge-watch.
Stay Close,1,"Character depth is created by harried reactions, the mood is uniformly ominous. It's not subtle, but it can be effective."
Stay Close,0,"The trouble with Stay Close is that it's too familiar. Despite the plethora of unexpected twists, this series manages to feel identical to every other crime drama that's been thrown out in recent years, and not a particularly great one at that."
Stay Close,1,"See you for the next episode, plus the six after that - and there's no point pretending otherwise."
Stay Close,1,"""Stay Close"" builds its puzzle slowly, through subliminal editing of past violence and through the silences in what the characters don't say to each other - empty spaces that invite us to imagine what happened to these people all those years ago."
Stay Close,1,"But even by the well-established standards of these things, Stay Close is particularly bonkers, a lightning-fast, highly binge-able thriller that works mostly by sensory overload and never quite giving a straight answer. Happy New Year!"
Stay Close,1,"Stay Close is compelling in the way that makes you want to keep going with it, if not compelling in the way that you'd remember it in much detail a few months down the line"
How to Get Away With Murder,0,"It was melodramatic and more than a little manipulative -- descriptions that have applied to the show from the beginning, but which were more tolerable before the novelty of its serialized mystery format wore off."
How to Get Away With Murder,1,"We're only one episode into How to Get Away With Murder's final season, and I'm already very worried about Annalise Keating."
How to Get Away With Murder,1,"If Viola Davis is planning on running an Emmy campaign for her final season in this career-changing role, this is a hell of a start."
How to Get Away With Murder,1,"t's a thrilling beginning, but will How To Get Away With Murder fall into its same old pattern of peaking too soon and then crumbling under the weight of its intentionally convoluted approach to mystery-building?"
How to Get Away With Murder,1,"It wouldn't be a shocking conclusion to see Annalise die by the series finale, but a closed casket and no sightings of any of her ""people"" has my interest piqued."
Elite,1,"It's a pity that the series that was once an addictive madness, it now conforms to being simply madness. [Full review in Spanish]"
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
Elite,1,"A big cult hit, it’s no masterpiece but is one of those oddly satisfying, binge-worthy curiosities."
Elite,1,"Its campy, its sexy, and its fun to watch. For the most part, Elite ticks all of the boxes that you want it to, and thats all that matters in the end."
Sweet Tooth,1,"I think the relationship between Gus and Big Man overrules any other issues I may have had with the show, and the performances of both actors are stellar."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Like the best family productions, Sweet Tooth evokes the child in the adult and the adult in the child, not pandering to youngsters with empty gestures nor implying crusty oldies cannot be filled with wonder."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth ends up resembling a fairy tale of sorts, with lush visuals and colors that pop, despite all the death and destruction on the edges."
Sweet Tooth,1,"When the show devolves into mystery and action, it loses much of what makes it unique -- but at least Gus is still there to help you make it through."
Sweet Tooth,1,"It's the show that the stuck-at-home-too-long audience needs right now, and it's a big, comic-book-loving blanket of a series."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is, by and large, a charming show anchored by a lovable protagonist. Making good use of its extensive budget, it works equally well for kids and adult audiences, adding a heartwarming and whimsical tone to a typically grim genre."
Sweet Tooth,1,"It makes our reality a tad more palatable. It provides a form of emotional hospice, allowing the viewers to revel in the show's dreamlike aura."
Sweet Tooth,1,"A charming coming-of-age story wrapped in postapocalyptic tragedy, Sweet Tooth manages to address its horrific circumstances with tenderness and warmth."
Sweet Tooth,1,"You may be wondering what Netflix were thinking by releasing such a show during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the series is a beacon of light during these dark times."
Sweet Tooth,1,"The series is a mix of whimsical, campy and reality which seems like an odd combination on paper, but works well for the story."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Young Christian makes a star-making turn as Gus, brilliantly conveying the lead character's daring streak, his innocence and his determination, all the while measuring up to his co-star Nonso in talent, albeit not in stature."
Sweet Tooth,0,"It seems unfair to call a drama about a ruined world a mess, but this feels, quite deliberately, all over the place."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Visually striking and grippingly plotted up to a cliffhanger of a season finale, Sweet Tooth is suspenseful, thoughtful, and timely in ways that couldn't have been planned."
Sweet Tooth,1,It is both mystifying and somehow fitting that one of the more cogent commentaries on our current messy mix of pandemics and politics revolves around a boy with antlers growing out of his head.
Sweet Tooth,1,"It's a sweet story, full of hope and good vibes, set against an all too familiar genre that is dark and gloomy."
Sweet Tooth,1,"In eight episodes, the series has managed to tell a compelling and meaningful story that seems prophetic in certain ways to our current world. But, as the filmmakers have coined it as a descriptive phrase, it is a storybook dystopia."
Sweet Tooth,1,"I'm enjoying the message of kindness and the incredible acting by the main character Gus, and Big Man (Nonso Anozie), I highly recommend this series which will be renewed for another season"
Sweet Tooth,1,"Whether Sweet Tooth can travel the same surprise path to stardom remains to be seen, but it's at least nice to have a new show worth following as we enter another summer..."
Sweet Tooth,1,"he discarded darker elements of the source material give the saga a softer edge, creating something more palpable for viewers to understand. The end result is an elegant and touching hero's journey."
Sweet Tooth,1,The Netflix adaptation of Jeff Lemire's comic manages to powerfully convey both the heart and the horror of its titular character's saga.
Sweet Tooth,1,"As far as end-of-the-world narratives go, Fury Road this isn't. Despite its apocalyptic premise, the show is weirdly sweet and family-friendly. Not great, exactly, but compelling in its own way."
Sweet Tooth,1,Brilliant. You're horrified but you're also giddy because this fable mixed with a thriller is so well done.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Combining sci-fi with fantasy, it's an intriguing post-apocalyptic tale, one that tugs at your heart."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth feels awfully familiar at first, and then goes places that surprise and delight."
Sweet Tooth,1,"After so many months without leaving home for fear of the virus, watching Sweet Tooth could be a good idea: it is a loving hug that rests on ideas about tolerance, solidarity and empathy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Sweet Tooth,1,Sweet Tooth presents a terrifying and desperate situation without this closing the possibility of a bright future. [Full Review in Spanish]
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is especially compelling as many of us move toward some form of post-pandemic normalcy, raising questions about what new world awaits us after such tremendous, collective loss."
Sweet Tooth,1,My heart had sunk: not another dystopia/fantasy/gothic kids' tale gussied up to con adults into watching two-and-a-bit episodes? But it's really rather lovely.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is an earnest adaptation elevated by strong characters, inspired performances, and the promise of more answers - and more questions - in its inevitable sophomore season."
Sweet Tooth,1,The series perfectly demonstrates how to tell several parallel stories and at the same time build a mythology around a cataclysmic event. [Full review in Spanish]
Sweet Tooth,1,"Its anchored by a terrific performance from Convery, who infuses Gus with childlike wonder and a deep well of empathy. Anozie also shines as Jep, and the series does a great job of toeing the line between being sweet and cynical."
Sweet Tooth,1,"There is a great deal of jeopardy along the way, but the scenes always come back to something reassuring, and there is no gore."
Sweet Tooth,1,Sweet Tooth brings something strange and heartfelt to the ongoing slew of apocalyptic stories hitting the big and small screens... an excellent fantasy about facing a world suddenly changing in ways where one catastrophe impacts every facet of life.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Weaving together three disparate plots that eventually intersect, the show offers three different visions of life after a devastating pandemic, each shaped by how its characters react to the end of the world."
Sweet Tooth,1,Packages real-world terrors in a fashion that at once confronts them honestly and contextualizes them in a way that's friendly for young teen viewers.
Sweet Tooth,1,"It's a gentle, delightful series that has a vein of tragedy running through it but it's not overwhelmingly dark."
Sweet Tooth,1,"The longer we spend in Gus's world the more we're encouraged to see our own within it. This might be a fantasy, but it isn't necessarily escapist."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Plague aftershock as entertainment seems preposterous right about now, but when transformed by the weirdo extremes of ""Sweet Tooth's"" universe, the subject becomes a post-apocalyptic joyride."
Sweet Tooth,1,"It is either warmly eccentric or hysterically crazy, perfect entertainment or a horrifying attempt to parlay the pandemic into a commercially palatable mashup."
Sweet Tooth,1,"It's got a great set-up... there's less of an overall arc, and it's more of a show of discovery for the characters involved."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Thanks to an appealing young star, a flashback-heavy structure, reassuring narration and a bright aesthetic, ""Sweet"" achieves the tricky art of a high-concept, family-friendly fantasy series."
Sweet Tooth,1,"""Sweet Tooth"" may not offer a full meal, but sometimes all you need is a good piece of chocolate."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is fascinating, charming, and it beautifully conveys a feeling of childlike wonder."
Sweet Tooth,1,Good performances and an adaptation that grounds things into some sort of reality saves the show from eye-rolling preciousness.
Sweet Tooth,0,"The show turns Jeff Lemire's lurid comic into a childlike adventure, but it loses the complexity, the ugliness, and the raw emotion that made the saga so rich in the first place."
Sweet Tooth,1,"For the right kind of kid, Sweet Tooth might make for good family viewing; there is enough in the way of complication here to keep parents intrigued without sending the show spinning down into pure absurdity for its own sake."
Sweet Tooth,1,Welcome to your long winter weekend addiction.
Sweet Tooth,1,A lot of really great cinematography and fight scenes and visuals... A breath of fresh air.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is poised to be the latest big budget smash hit fantasy series for Netflix, delivering a warm and epic adventure."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth mixes its heartfelt nature with this dark premise, and it ultimately creates one of the more magical experiences of the year. This has the potential to be a massive series."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Despite the on-the-nose elements of the show's pandemic portrayal, Sweet Tooth is a series worth your time and emotional energy."
Sweet Tooth,1,"The costumes, sets, and action scenes follow suit; all of them work in tandem to build an impressive, hard-to-describe tone, which somehow is a bullseye that hits family-friendly, high fantasy, comic book movie, and survival thriller all at once."
Sweet Tooth,1,"With a winning (and occasionally brutal) approach to its darkly fantastical imaginings, Sweet Tooth find a nice balance between its sugary and bitter elements."
Sweet Tooth,1,An open letter to Netflix - please do not cancel this. Sweet Tooth deserves to stay. Let it breathe.
Sweet Tooth,1,"The inaugural season only chronicles part of Gus and Jepperd's journey, but what a mark it leaves. This adaptation slowly worms its way into your heart and threatens to rip it out through awe, wonder, and character-driven emotional depth."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth's messages of hope and resilience, even in the darkest moments, is perfectly timed, giving us a buoyant fable for an uncertain age."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Emotionally and geographically, this is a show with real epic scope, and it earns the laughter and occasional tears that it wrings from the audience thanks to a real and unquestionable, well, sweetness."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Some pretty heady ideas here for a kids show, but then family entertainment, like so many things in 2021, is evolving in ways that we haven't seen before."
Sweet Tooth,1,A very well done show that keeps what made the comic special but makes it more mainstream. The locations are incredible and the cast is amazing. Definitely worth watching.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Whether Gus and friends are having scary adventures or fun ones, those parts of Sweet Tooth are full of life, and as exciting or tense as needed. The show can be hit or miss, though, when it moves away from Gus."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Despite the dark premise of this series, it is heartfelt, fun, and its lead is as sweet as the title suggests."
Sweet Tooth,1,The performances are strong throughout -- Anozie is particularly remarkable -- but it's the consistently inventive writing and robust filmmaking that makes the project stand out.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is a success. It's a near-perfect adaptation. It's strong when it comes to effects work, acting, and story."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is an absolute joy to behold, brimming with love, hope, beauty, and, well, sweet treats."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Sweet Tooth is a wholly enjoyable, family-friendly comic book TV series that features amazing performances from its leads, and sets the stage for future stories in a way that's left us anxious to return to this weird, charming world."
Sweet Tooth,1,Sweet Tooth is a well-rounded epic that has the potential to be a long-running success for Netflix that will keep audiences entertained for seasons to come.
Sweet Tooth,1,"Fittingly switching between sweetness and bite, Sweet Tooth is a children's fable fit for grown-ups."
Sweet Tooth,1,"The chemistry between Convery and Anozie keeps the story ticking along. The central partnership between these two is the key selling point of the show, bringing a sense of sweetness and sentiment that buoys the occasionally dark subject matter."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Frankly, Sweet Tooth is premiering at the right time. Even though some may roll their eyes at a story that kicks off with a pandemic and a lingering virus threat, we can all relate to this material in some way. It's the hope that sticks with you."
Sweet Tooth,1,"A dark and gritty story wrapped in a visually stunning bow, offering messages of nature thriving, and hope for humankind."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Featuring a beautiful central dynamic and surprisingly optimistic message, Sweet Tooth breathes new life into the often dark post-apocalyptic genre."
Sweet Tooth,1,"In a world full of post-apocalyptic stories, Sweet Tooth flips the genre on its head with gorgeous storybook visuals and a rousing message of hope. This show an absolute must-see."
Sweet Tooth,1,"Christian Convery as Gus is adorable, and his relationship with Nonso as Big Man is very sweet... Their adventure has me hyped for the inevitable second season."
Bodyguard,1,"What the series creators, fully consciously of it or not, do show is a country ruled by vehemently anti-democratic and authoritarian cliques, none of whom would exhibit the slightest qualms about establishing openly dictatorial rule."
Bodyguard,1,"Madden plays Budd like a time bomb poised to detonate, revealing a man scarred by his wartime experiences. Hawes is excellent as the hawkish politician and Mercurio keeps the twists coming through to the finale."
Bodyguard,1,"She's older, upper class, English, and female; he's younger, working class, Scottish, and male. There's 50 shades of ""ma'am"" in the way he addresses her."
Bodyguard,1,"While Bodyguard is being billed as a thriller, at its core it's that old favourite of the British isles, the police procedural - and crucially, even when it's just going through the procedures, it stays engaging."
Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.
Bodyguard,1,Six hours of a magnificent police drama. [Full Review in Spanish]
Bodyguard,1,"The more ridiculous and far-fetched Bodyguard becomes, the more I am gripped."
Bodyguard,1,"A taut limited series from the UK that will curl your hair; it is INTENSE. If you haven't seen it, hold a day to devote to six full length episodes on Netflix and expect to be deeply spooked."
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
Bodyguard,1,"The story takes wild, violent leaps amid myriad conspiracies, leading to a crazy, nail-biting climax that is both preposterous and wholly satisfying. Some binges feel like a slog. Bodyguard is more of a race, well worth the run."
Bodyguard,1,The intense BBC drama didn't disappoint as it went out all guns blazing.
Bodyguard,1,"This has been a brilliant, compulsive, five-star mind trip of a series."
Bodyguard,0,The result is a fatally broken series - it starts very well and goes off the rails in its last episodes - but it is blatantly visible that it offers the same discourse as the cinema of the 70s: the institutions are rotten. [Full Review in Spanish]
Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]"
Bodyguard,1,"Pure, can't-take-your-eyes away entertainment that's bound to have you saying ""just one more episode before bed."" This is sterling television, a well-crafted crime thriller, which is what the BBC does best."
Bodyguard,1,It's had a tremendous critical reception... and virtually everyone who's mentioned it to me says it's brilliant. The opening definitely was; the rest of the episode wasn't quite at that level.
Bodyguard,1,"It's two things at once - the list of who did what and the reminder of what happened - and it feels nicely succinct. Like everything else about ""Bodyguard,"" including its hero, the opening is taut."
Bodyguard,1,"The denouement is far too wordy and protracted, albeit peppered with some genuinely nail-biting moments. The show has earned your patience by this point, though, so you will gladly watch to the end."
Bodyguard,1,Suspenseful political crime show is smart but violent.
Bodyguard,1,"In only six chapters, this British series is capable of enthusing you, engaging you and then shortly after, turning into a light disappointment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Bodyguard,1,A shot of adrenaline. A reminder of how engaging and engrossing the medium of telly can be.
Bodyguard,1,"The world of Bodyguard is all cynical shades of gray, where the best you can hope for is just to survive."
Bodyguard,0,"It's a failed opportunity, and the result is a story that offers tantalizing threads of complexity, only to cut them all off right as they start combining into something truly innovative."
Bodyguard,1,"After watching the entire series in one six-hour sitting, I get it. It made my heart race. It made me sweaty. I felt at times flush and lightheaded. And that was just Keeley Hawes."
Bodyguard,1,"The series is ultimately Madden's, who handily proves he's capable of much, much more than brooding as King in the North."
Bodyguard,1,"It helps that Madden looks like an old-fashioned action hero, but can embody the ideals of one, too, albeit with conflict and angst that feel distinctly contemporary."
Bodyguard,1,The way these stories zero in on the morally compromised institutions responsible for individual suffering screams 2018...[Bodyguard] subverts thriller tropes just often enough to earn its reliance on them.
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a perfectly calibrated thriller that cleverly builds up the tension so you're always questioning what you see and hear, puzzling over everyone's motivations and real loyalties, and to hook you from beginning to end."
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard remains a gripping and thoroughly entertaining adventure that's emotionally deft, but that clumsy ending dims its overall excellence."
Bodyguard,1,Those are minor gripes given the thrill factor and how easily Bodyguard grabs your attention and doesn't relinquish it.
Bodyguard,1,"As Budd, Richard Madden is astonishing. His sweet good looks could have worked against the gravity of his role, but instead they give his tortured psychology a sympathetic appeal."
Bodyguard,1,"Netflix's Bodyguard delivers a thrilling first season, proving why it's the UK's most-watched drama of 2018 so far."
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard could unfold as a boilerplate political thriller, but the series defies expectations at every twist and turn-almost."
Bodyguard,1,The end result is an engaging series that walks a very fine line between grounded political thriller and something far more outlandish.
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a tense, tightly plotted thrill ride that makes almost no false moves."
Bodyguard,1,"Mercurio and director Thomas Vincent grasp the viewer like a stressball in the palm of a hand. Squeeze, release, repeat."
Bodyguard,1,Madden's face is the kind of canvas that you want to watch for clues.
Bodyguard,1,"Stream it - it's one of the best first episodes we've seen all year, and it feels like the wild ride of Bodyguard is just getting started."
Bodyguard,1,"There may be nothing groundbreaking about Bodyguard, but it's easy to see why it's breaking records. Like its politico-thriller forerunners, the show is taut entertainment for our time..."
Bodyguard,1,"To watch Bodyguard's six episodes is to suspend disbelief and submit to its surprises. It helps not to expect too much more than that, particularly when it comes to the show's lavish employment of archetypes."
Bodyguard,1,"One nagging plot hole doesn't detract from the momentum, and it's almost uncanny how deftly the series shifts the weight of the viewer's suspicions without coming off too tricksy. Good stuff."
Bodyguard,1,"It can also be a blast, if you're all about the mystery and the forward momentum and your requirements for plausibility and psychological realism aren't high."
Bodyguard,1,"The key resolution is that despite all the nefarious men populating the series, women were actually always the biggest power players in this political thriller."
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is bloody brilliant from the get-go. And if you watch, pay close attention to the terrorist who is tackled. It will be important later."
Bodyguard,1,"Even when Bodyguard does get a bit over the top, that same British flair for understatement prevents it from feeling as ridiculous as it might in other hands."
Bodyguard,1,"This enthralling thriller series should come with warnings about how anxiety-inducing it is, as well as how much you'll now want Richard Madden to play James Bond."
Bodyguard,1,"More concerned with being a good ride than exploring character or politics, the show is awash in a timely cynicism."
Bodyguard,1,"The action is well mounted and the tension tightly wound; it uncoils, when it does, with a satisfying snap."
Bodyguard,1,"Both juicy in its delving into character psychology and rippingly ready to tear up its playbook as it goes, it's a six-episode ride that demands, and rewards, a quick binge."
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is a thriller first, and in respect to the elements that relate to the genre, the show masterfully excels. What makes it work is how well the show presents in the form of a slow-burn story despite moving at a rather quick stride."
Bodyguard,1,"[Bodyguard is] one of those crowd-pleasing thrillers that manages to be both cerebral and terrible, where characters constantly do dumb things that leave you howling at the screen."
Bodyguard,1,"Madden and Hawes have incredible chemistry, and like Madden, Hawes balances the public and private faces of her character with ease."
Bodyguard,1,The plot makes up in symmetry what it may lack in believability.
Bodyguard,1,[Mercurio] sprints the thin line between thrilling and tosh.
Bodyguard,1,"The scripts are so gripping and suspenseful, once you've watched one episode, it's hard not to become hooked."
Bodyguard,1,"Mercurio, the writer behind the gritty police procedural Line of Duty, has a way of bringing psychological complexity to the more outlandish pleasures of the thriller genre, and Bodyguard slaloms happily between the two."
Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard...still might be the best thing Jed Mercurio has ever written.
Bodyguard,1,"Even though Bodyguard is sometimes wanting, you can't much argue with the power and tension of the central relationship."
Bodyguard,1,"Viewers are in for a bumpy ride, though a thrilling one too, I hope."
Bodyguard,1,"The action mesmerises, nearly stops you drawing breath."
Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard starts frenetic and stays there.
Bodyguard,1,"I can't wait to see what happens next. However, I do wonder about some of the casting. Though Madden can be rather wooden, that doesn't matter a jot here."
Bodyguard,1,"In Bodyguard, Mercurio trains his eye and his nose for corruption on the corridors of power and, by the end of [the] opening episode, it was clear he has created something as dark and moreish as ever."
Bodyguard,1,Bodyguard is an extremely successful production. Imagine it as a cross between The Thick of It and a Bond movie and you'll have the measure of it.
Bodyguard,1,"Besides the sharp scripting and deft direction, also key to hooking the audience here is Madden's rather revelatory performances."
Bodyguard,1,All I can say is I already do not trust anyone in it - which is exactly what you want from a thriller.
Bodyguard,1,"Bodyguard is intelligent, psychological storytelling so gripping you'll have to remind yourself to breathe."
Bodyguard,1,"Already it's a wild, thrilling ride. One thing is clear: Bodyguard is heading nowhere obvious."
Bodyguard,1,Richard Madden was spot-on as the inscrutable Budd.
Bodyguard,1,"It runs like explosive clockwork, and even when you know that the conversation has turned too damned quiet, the shock and awe of the ""maybe gunfire"" is irresistible."
Rutherford Falls,1,"Ed Helms' Nathan is back in season 2, ready to ""de-center"" himself as a white dude living in a town built on Native land. It's the best decision he — and the show itself — could have made."
Rutherford Falls,1,This sophomore season from Peacock continues to make some brave choices.
Rutherford Falls,1,"Not only is Rutherford Falls an enjoyable watch, but the sitcom thoughtfully dissects American culture and centers Native stories. There’s no dearth of excellent television right now, but this heartwarming, funny, and boundary-breaking show is a must-see."
Rutherford Falls,1,"An endearing revisit to the world of Rutherford Falls and the Minishonka Nation. If you enjoy hot dog condiment fights, getting into the wrong funeral casket and burning toy babies while running a firefighter’s gauntlet, you’re in for a real treat."
Rutherford Falls,1,"A sweeter, steadier sophomore outing."
Rutherford Falls,1,"Rutherford Falls puts a much-needed twist on the sitcom formula, finding a perpetually clever sense of hilarity at nearly every turn."
Parks and Recreation,1,A warm reunion with its characters to raise spirits in difficult times. [Full Review in Spanish]
Parks and Recreation,1,"An entertaining, sharply written episode about our times."
Parks and Recreation,1,"A fresh episode set during the age of social distancing provides welcome updates on Leslie, Ron and many, many other old friends."
Parks and Recreation,1,"The cast of ""Parks and Rec"" reunited for a coronavirus charity special. It was so good, and an undertaking that only this show could have pulled off. We pray no one else tries."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Nine times out of 10 -- really, 99 out of 100 -- TV revivals are a bad idea even under optimal production conditions. ... This was an exception to the rule"
Parks and Recreation,1,"No one knows how to take lemons and make lemonade like Leslie Knope, and that's definitely what A Parks and Recreation Special feels like -- an unexpected silver lining to a dark cloud. Was it necessary? No. Was it enjoyable? Heck yeah."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Parks and Recreation returned to make us smile, and the special definitely hit us in the heart. We salute you, Leslie Knope, and your extended friend family, and we thank you for your help in this troubling situation."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Parks and Rec delivered to its fans what the show is famous for: Hope, sweetness, enthusiasm, and light comedy."
Parks and Recreation,1,"The entire event was a love letter to the series, and its closing moments were heartfelt enough to get any Parks and Rec fan in their feelings."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Watching the reunion special, I found I could still enjoy its bighearted comedy, albeit less as optimistic realism and more as utopian science fiction."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Parks and Recreation managed to raft a reunion special that, while satisfying on a base level, also speaks directly to the challenges we're facing today."
Parks and Recreation,1,"There are no new resolutions needed. Instead, It's meant to exemplify the very core of Leslie and the show itself: doing good."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Rather than pure escapism or cringe-worthy seriousness, the Parks and Rec writers created something that feels urgent without being self-important, and sweet without being saccharine."
Parks and Recreation,1,It was impossible to dislike - even if it was inescapably melancholy.
Parks and Recreation,1,"Groundbreaking or not, we need that warmth and that hope now more than ever and, with a characteristically good cause, ""A Parks and Recreation Special"" more than delivered."
Parks and Recreation,1,"""A Parks and Recreation Special"" doesn't need my charitable pass because it's a delight. Given the technical limitations and difficult circumstances, the Parks team is able to create something that feels like a satisfying reunion."
Parks and Recreation,1,"It was everything fans of the sweet, hopeful and hilarious series could have hoped for in this time of great need."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Well, I cried, of course. But it was the nice kind of crying. Maybe I even needed it. And hey, sometimes that's all you can ask for from a visit with old friends."
Parks and Recreation,1,It's fun. I loved it. Spending 30 minutes visiting these fake characters who I haven't seen in five years ranked right up there with many of my Zoom calls to friends and family who I haven't seen in what feels like five years.
Parks and Recreation,1,"Against all odds, though, A Parks and Recreation Special is a genuine return from one of the best TV series ever made. In a strange way, the sitcom's faux-documentary structure lends itself well to the videoconferencing conceit."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Thanks, everyone. We needed this."
Parks and Recreation,1,The Parks and Rec special was a lot of fun as an experiment. I don't want to see it become the new normal.
Parks and Recreation,1,A Parks and Recreation Special landed the same way that a Zoom call with high school classmates or former co-workers from a decade ago does. It made us feel like we were reconnecting with old friends.
Parks and Recreation,1,"This made for a better kind of very special episode. ""Parks"" didn't return for half an hour to tell us what to think; it helped us feel what we feel."
Parks and Recreation,1,"""A Parks and Recreation Special"" is one nice surprise after another, and I was glad to have each be, you know, surprising."
Parks and Recreation,1,"Fortunately, the one-off special doesn't disappoint, as the cast and crew did an amazing job when it comes to picking up where things let off."
Longmire,1,Wonderful cast; great locale; entertaining script. Hate to see this show close down.
Longmire,1,"It will be interesting to see how and when the show begins to address the finality of things, and whether or not Longmire plans go out big or if it will stay business as usual for the sheriff of Absaroka County."
House,0,"""Everybody Dies"" is a failure of ambition, a frustratingly slapdash affair that tries to hide its lack of ideas behind the usual forced theatrics, reeking of a fan-fiction-like conviction in its own awesomeness. And it sucked. Hard."
House,1,"Thanks for the enjoyable ride, House. I'll miss your endless sarcastic wit, your perfect stubble and your brutal honesty."
House,1,"The show still offers something you don't find elsewhere on network TV: a mad, sad scientist who almost certainly does not have a heart of gold."
House,1,"House had, in its final seasons, become a rather sentimental show anyway. A fitting ending, in other words."
House,1,House snapped back to form this season and delivered a solid suite of farewell episodes.
House,1,"Despite containing some thematic similarities to the aforementioned installments, all of the plots presented center around the human side of House, rather than the all-too-familiar unrelenting diagnostician."
House,1,"You really have to hand it to the team, as they've crafted a flawed, yet hugely satisfying series ender that wraps things up where needed while leaving enough open for fans to ponder."
House,1,House may be as predictable as a three-frame Peanuts cartoon; but low on their own supply after a mere eight seasons? Not a bit of it.
House,1,"A fitting finale and swan song for House, even if one hasn't kept up with the series' eight-year run."
House,1,The sudden introduction of suicidal thoughts could easily play as soapy...But House has always been a character with one foot in the self-inflicted grave.
House,0,This once-venerable hit is suffering from a serious case of been-there-itis.
House,1,"""Everybody Dies"" was as close to a perfect House finale as I could possible imagine, a fabulous hour of television that cut straight to the heart of what House has always been about."
House,1,"Credit Laurie for making such an unlikable character likable, if not completely adorable."
The Affair,1,"The overwhelming majority of The Affair's episodes are directed by men, making it difficult to push beyond the male gaze."
The Affair,1,"No TV series has dropped the viewer in the middle of narrative discord quite so effectively, as each hour split its perspective among different characters."
The Affair,1,"The soapy plot is getting ridiculously bubblier - but some of us remain determined to find out what crazy thing happens next, dramatized by some of the best actors on TV."
The Affair,1,There is nothing more The Affair than these two getting together (and then inevitably falling apart in an epic catastrophe).
The Affair,1,"It's such an odd yet intriguing swerve, much in keeping with ""The Affair's"" willingness to mess around."
The Affair,1,"The drama, well scripted and beautifully acted as ever, continues to play around with time frames as we saw flashbacks to Vik's terminal cancer."
The Affair,1,"The original spark that came from Noah and Alison has fizzled out but there are still plenty of knotty relationships, zinging lines and even a larky cameo from Danish actor Claes Bang... This affair seems far from over."
The Affair,1,"The central character list might be a bit slimmer, but the suffering is still the same in The Affair's fifth and final season."
The Affair,1,"There's something insanely watchable about The Affair, tricks and all."
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
The Affair,0,Cringeworthy: that is the only descriptor for the events that transpire throughout this episode.
The Affair,1,"In a perfect world, this show would have run a tight three seasons, but on a network that has a tendency to run its shows long past its expiration date, The Affair has thankfully been allowed to end on its own terms and not overstay its welcome."
The Affair,1,"I'd probably follow these characters (even Whitney) for an indefinite number of seasons - partly because of the sucker that I am, but also because ""The Affair"" can never be completely considered down for the count."
The Affair,1,Tierney's performance as Helen is what really anchors this season and makes it as watchable as it is.
The Affair,1,"""The Affair"" began at the ""End"" - Montauk - five seasons ago, and ends at The End. This seems exactly right."
The Affair,1,"The Affair has always been a fascinating show to watch because much like its characters, it has never feared following its instincts down the wildest paths possible, even if those instincts lead to some terrible choices."
Queer as Folk,0,"Queer as Folk always felt dangerous and interesting, as if we were peeking in on a world we shouldn’t. The reboot feels jaded, as if we are watching things we’ve seen a hundred times before."
Queer as Folk,1,"It adds up to a warm, intricate, humane portrait of a world in which people are finding their feet and their chosen families, all on constantly shifting sands. It’s good to have the folk back."
Queer as Folk,1,"Somehow, Queer As Folk finds ever more delicious and delirious ways of offering prickly story beats and character arcs that refuse to flatten or homogenize the LGBTQ+ community."
Queer as Folk,1,"It may be trash TV, but it’s OUR trash TV, and that makes all the difference."
Queer as Folk,1,"Ultimately the new Queer as Folk, by telling a wider and more disparate set of stories, manages to produce a narrative that's broader and deeper — and significantly queerer — than its predecessors."
Queer as Folk,0,"There’s plenty of emoting going on, and the issues at stake are clear enough, but there’s not enough character depth and warmth in the air. The characters seem self-absorbed, and, alas, their romantic histrionics and struggles didn’t move me."
Queer as Folk,1,"Queer as Folk returns, with new characters caught up in the aftermath of a mass shooting. Trauma, romance, betrayal, and a lot of sex ensue in a proudly diverse, reimagined show."
Queer as Folk,1,"Peacock’s iteration of the British 1999-2000 series Queer as Folk proves itself a pretty good queer soap if you can tolerate how self-absorbed, narcissistic and generally unlikeable most of the characters are."
Queer as Folk,1,"Some viewers will find the thoughtless Brodie and his sitcom shenanigans too grating, but the series’ thoughtfulness and its sense of joy, inclusion and community make it a real winner."
Queer as Folk,1,"While there’s a lot of messiness in this new version of Queer As Folk, it also introduces an interesting new set of characters and examines how much things have changed and stayed the same for the LGBTQIA community."
Queer as Folk,1,"Peacock’s Queer As Folk hits hard but feels needed. It’s not perfect, but that gives us much to discuss."
Queer as Folk,1,"But it's Jesse James Keitel as a trans woman trying to navigate her relationship, motherhood, and her own desires that is the breakout performer. Keitel is truly mesmerizing to watch, as is the series!"
Queer as Folk,0,"A ripped-from-the-headlines premise may locate the new series in the white-hot center of modernity, but Dunn and company extract little insight from that aggressive timeliness."
Queer as Folk,1,"Queer as Folk has an abrasive, punky insouciance that's charming, and some nicely calibrated performances; it has a taste for excess that's winningly brazen, when parcelled out."
Queer as Folk,1,"It makes for gripping, sometimes solemn, sometimes irreverent and always sexy viewing."
Queer as Folk,1,"A continually fun, moving, gripping ride and one of the most exciting shows on television."
Queer as Folk,1,"Equal parts silly, sexy, serious and smart."
Queer as Folk,1,"“Queer as Folk” rises to the occasion when it explores the bigger contemporary themes in the LGBTQ community, even when the show is tethered to some of the baggage of previous versions of the series."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"Its a pretty classic whodunit, where everybodys a suspect and nobodys talking. By blending in teen drama  refreshingly not sanitized to satisfy network censors  it keeps things interesting while feeling comfortably familiar."
One of Us Is Lying,0,"The conclusion will be a surprise, one assumes. But the getting there is, as they might say in French class, déjà vu."
One of Us Is Lying,1,Passionate fans of the YA novel this steamy teen series is based on will be glad to know the TV version's mostly faithful to the book and is well-made and arresting yet cliched and slow to start.
One of Us Is Lying,1,"The production is glossy and the acting is mediocre, but the writing is solid, and it's all perfectly tailored to the streaming era."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"While I do like that they're taking these different archetypes and stereotypes and making commentary on them, so far the story doesn't feel that different from other mysteries or teen dramas of the same genre."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"The story, based on the wildly popular young-adult novel by Karen M. McManus, deftly tweaks its balance of suspicions to keep things interesting, but it's McKenna and Van Grootel who really pull focus."
One of Us Is Lying,1,"One of Us Is Lying has potential and good actors. Restraint, however, continues to bog it down in the first three episodes."
One of Us Is Lying,1,What eludes One of Us Is Lying is some special spark to set it apart from all the other murder mysteries and teen dramas out there... some jagged edges to break up all its slick competence.
One of Us Is Lying,1,"Filled with twists and turns that will keep those who haven't read the book guessing. The acting and writing is sub par, but does get better as it goes on."
Chucky,1,"When the series finally kicks into gear, Chucky possesses the exuberant, mean-spirited magic of the best of the franchise."
Chucky,1,Chucky manages to perfectly balance building on the franchises past with a clear eye to the future. This show is playing the hits while also experimenting and pushing itself into new and fresh directions.
Chucky,1,What's really surprising is the naturalness with which the series develops the sincere scenes of [Devon and Arthur] falling in love. [Full review in Spanish]
Chucky,1,"Chucky works rather well, with the doll coming first to embody then pervert Jake's wholly reasonable desire for revenge on his tormentors."
Chucky,1,Deliver something much more thoughtful than its gory veneer lets on.
Chucky,1,"All told, Chucky's campy mix of satire and slaughter has the potential to draw in new fans while expanding on the Child's Play cinematic universe in ways that longtime fans will surely enjoy."
Chucky,1,"In general there's a surprising depth and a willingness to grow beyond slasher stereotypes, here. Chucky not only acts as a love letter to the franchise, but moves it forward into the modern age."
Chucky,0,"These script ""gimmicks"" feel insufficient to re-launch a product that is perceived as exhausted. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chucky,0,"Ultimately, there are better, scarier things you can be watching than Chucky."
Chucky,1,"It overall remains true to the tone of the movies that preceded it, and this jump to the small screen hasn't dulled Chucky's edge."
Chucky,1,"Chucky is a delight; a warped, wise, funny and very droll series with bits of gore thrown in, but nothing gory enough to hurt your head. It's a rigorous reinvention."
Chucky,1,"This is a solid start to Chucky's latest venture, promising all of the high-camp thrills and spills we associate with the horror icon."
Chucky,1,"As it unfolds, Chucky offers up some new toybox treasures for fans of the franchise."
Chucky,1,"It won't win over many new converts, but anyone with a soft spot for the cheery maniac doll will no doubt get a kick out of his latest reign of terror."
Chucky,1,Chucky is a fun character-driven horror show that asks the question: what would happen if a killer doll showed up to that pool party scene in Bo Burnham's Eighth Grade?
Chucky,1,"Chucky is scary once again, and I can't wait to see what havoc he unleashes."
Chucky,1,"Chucky adds some fun story elements to the ""murdering doll"" dynamic, bringing the franchise back to it's earliest days."
Chucky,1,"Fit neatly into the Child's Play series as both a perfect onboarding point for new fans, and a breath of fresh air for series veterans."
Chucky,1,"Chucky is a richer, more personal experience - and yet as frightening as ever."
Chucky,1,"It's scary, it's funny, it's a little campy. We have this new fresh middle school setting and we're telling this new story while also still [...] learning more about this history and legacy of this entire franchise."
Chucky,1,A strong start to the next chapter in this illustrious franchise that touches on some deeper issues.
Chucky,1,"I was also thrilled with how well Mancini balanced out the nods to the Chucky-verse but also creates this new story at the same time, and there are even some other homages to other horror properties as well."
Chucky,1,"Tonally, the series picks up the black comedy from its predecessors, and that's not a bad thing. The glaring issue was in some of the dialogue, however."
Chucky,1,"Chucky, the new series premiering on Syfy, retains all of the character's penchant for grotesque kills and juvenile, acidic humor... Elegant, this show is not."
Chucky,1,"Brad Dourif's voice work has always been what makes the character so distinctive and, at times, extremely funny, so the actor's inclusion here pays big dividends."
Chucky,1,"For all of its blood-soaked mayhem, though, it's also worth noting that Chucky is surprisingly warm in terms of its atmosphere and direction."
Chucky,1,"Chucky is a fine attempt at bringing the killer doll to the small screen. The allure of Brad Dourif as the evil doll is enough to lure me back. But if you aren't familiar with the Child's Play franchise, don't start with Chucky."
Chucky,0,There's only one vaguely interesting formula tweak here and it's Mancini's decision to make his protagonist queer and then to handle it with a refreshingly casual sensitivity.
Chucky,1,"Honestly, anybody tuning in to Chucky is there for the doll. In that respect, the series delivers solidly."
Chucky,1,"With a start this strong, Chucky has found a new home on television. I can easily see being this show's friend to the end."
Chucky,1,"While you won't have to worry about sleeping with the light on, the premiere is an effective, witty next step for the worst ""Good Guy"" ever."
Chucky,1,"Horror franchises come and go, but Chucky is forever."
Chucky,1,"Fans of Mancini's films will find plenty to like about Chucky, although the four episodes available for review are also accessible for new viewers."
Chucky,1,"Chucky walks a fascinating tonal tightrope as a funny, absurd series that engenders sympathy as well as shock."
Chucky,1,Offers an admirably different perspective for a horror franchise -- but viewers will need to buy into the teen drama to appreciate this iteration of Chucky.
The Thing About Pam,1,"Despite an impressive supporting cast that includes Josh Duhamel and Judy Greer, it’s Zellweger who very much ensures the spotlight stays on her."
The Thing About Pam,1,"Renée Zellwegers award-worthy performance, shes almost unrecognizable as Pam Hupp--which makes the series watchable."
The Thing About Pam,0,This series is a frustrating and surprisingly boring attempt to cash in on the true crime boom.
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
The Thing About Pam,1,"The Thing About Pam has some serious tonal issues, but it’s not without some merit. Zellwegger is good, the prosthetic notwithstanding, and Fleshler is an outstanding character actor."
The Thing About Pam,1,"Maybe it’s a good thing to be so unmoored by a TV show. For better or worse, that destabilization, that determined desire for clarity on what this show is, will keep me watching. Yet another one of The Thing About Pam’s surprises."
The Thing About Pam,1,Renée Zellweger transforms in this darkly funny true-crime series.
The Thing About Pam,1,"Hats off to Renée Zellweger to go all out in portraying the frumpily sinister Pam Hupp. Not only is it a more accurate representation of its suburban Midwest setting, it’s far more entertaining than any number of sleek, coastal Nicole Kidman cable series."
The Thing About Pam,0,"Overall, The Thing About Pam feels lackluster and gaudy, with zero care for the victims and treatment of Pam as if she’s a celebrity for a good reason."
The Thing About Pam,0,The flourishes used on The Thing About Pam were tiring us out by the end of the first episode; we can’t imagine how exhausted we’ll feel after watching the entire six-episode season.
The Thing About Pam,1,"The Thing About Pam stars Zellweger as another monster and she brings an equal amount of vinegary exuberance to the work. But instead of playing a fantasy figure of cold depravity, she’s playing a real person."
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
The Thing About Pam,0,"It’d be a shame if Zellweger’s first acting gig after her Oscar-boosted return to Hollywood were, ultimately, little more than NBC cross-promotion."
The Thing About Pam,0,"Even over six episodes, this series is far too long and not worth the effort that Renee Zellweger puts into playing the title character."
The Thing About Pam,0,It's a true-crime experiment that clearly wants to be the next Fargo and doesn't get there.
The Thing About Pam,1,The Thing About Pam does an impressive job of translating an addictive tale to the small screen.
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
The Thing About Pam,0,Zellweger is simultaneously broadly cartoonish and blandly nonspecific. She squints so much that her eyes lose whatever interiority they might have reflected; there is no real difference between her smile or her frown.
The Thing About Pam,0,There’s a lot of blurriness of intention around the storytelling in The Thing About Pam and an ultimately complacent belief that Renée Zellweger slurping on soda is enough to count as Emmy bait.
The Thing About Pam,1,"Zellweger, in her biggest TV role so far, looks like she is thoroughly enjoying her time as this larger-than-life character, whose boldness knew no end until she was finally made to face the consequences of her crime streak."
The Thing About Pam,0,"When the Coen Brothers-inspired tone works, it's deliciously satisfying. But then you remember that this entertainingly stranger-than-fiction story wouldn't exist if innocent people hadn't died, and you feel little queasy."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
The Thing About Pam,1,Even if you've never watched Dateline NBC -- but more especially if you have -- NBC's miniseries The Thing About Pam is irresistibly entertaining.
The Thing About Pam,1,"Its purpose, generally, is to keep things reassuringly intimate, and above the fray. Such things aside, all in all this is a wholly compelling tale."
The Thing About Pam,1,"With its zippy tone of cocked-eyebrow camp, the limited NBC series about convicted murderer Pam Hupp is a welcome departure from the current avalanche of poker-faced true-crime efforts."
Bel-Air,1,"In its 2022 iteration, Bel-Air capitalizes on the two things dominating television today: nitty-gritty realism, and nostalgia."
Bel-Air,0,"The missing element here is the camp of a juicy soap. If we can’t laugh, then we should gasp. Remaking an iconic series is a silly endeavor—why not lean all the way into that?"
Bel-Air,1,Bel-Air is enjoyable enough as a dramatic reboot of the popular '90s sitcom starring Will Smith.
Bel-Air,1,"While the symbolism may sometimes be laid on a little thick, Cooper demonstrates early that he isn’t afraid to tackle thought-provoking social debates."
Bel-Air,1,"Like the original, it gets by on the charm of its lead, the immediate distaste for Carlton, and the warmth and loveliness of Aunt Viv (if Cassandra Freeman is recast, there will be hell to pay)."
Bel-Air,1,"With a two-season order and the promise of curiosity from an audience looking to write this off, Bel-Air is likely to catch many off guard."
Bel-Air,0,"Painfully earnest and mostly stripped of its original buoyancy, this formerly amusing and entertaining fish-out-of-water story is left gasping for an original thought."
Bel-Air,1,"There’s a lot at play, addressing issues of race, wealth, class, striving for the American Dream, and then getting it for good or ill. This is a dark take, and reflective of the times."
Bel-Air,0,"All the humour, warmth and character of the original has been sucked out and replaced with... nothing, really."
Bel-Air,1,"The shift from comedy to drama and 90’s to modern day is jarring at times, but the performances are compelling. There’s something here -- hopefully they figure out exactly what."
Bel-Air,1,"Whether this all adds up to something is hard to say at this juncture, but its definitely worth sticking around to find out."
Bel-Air,1,"Despite the more serious tone, the show still has heart."
Bel-Air,0,"Peacock’s reimagining of the ’90s sitcom goes over the top with drama, conflict and heavy-handed symbolism."
Bel-Air,1,"Bel-Air has the potential to truly stand on its own if it doesn’t try to be to cute with its ties to The Fresh Prince. From what we’ve seen in the first episode, it’s well on its way to doing that."
Bel-Air,1,"The main Banks making the series work is Jabari, the newcomer playing the fictional Will Smith. He has a lively swagger that emerges more readily as the series goes on."
Bel-Air,1,"This show sits comfortably at the intersection of nostalgia, drama and Blackness. Out of the remakes that continue to flood your streaming networks, Bel-Air is the one you should be watching."
Bel-Air,1,"Overall “Bel-Air” is its own, surprisingly engaging production. What it does have fully in common with its predecessor is that even as it remains entertaining, it still has much more to say."
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
Bel-Air,0,This series has a long way to go before it earns its crown.
Bel-Air,0,Bel-Air strives for authenticity in the most thinly drawn manner possible.
Bel-Air,1,"Morgan Cooper has successfully translated his short viral video into an interesting series, but Bel-Air needs to differentiate itself a bit more or it risks becoming a spoof of itself."
Bel-Air,1,"The series has the acting talent to be its own thing, but it feels a bit unfair to burden the ensemble so overwhelmingly with those who played them before."
Bel-Air,1,"The opening episodes establish a catchy beat, with the main question being how long they can sustain it."
Bel-Air,1,"Fantastic update that works on two levels - nostalgia for the original sitcom while also a great soap opera in the vein of another 90s hit, Beverly Hills 90210.  Also very topical without being preachy. Will vs Carlton is the biggest change, but it works."
Bel-Air,1,Its interesting how well Bel-Air remixes and plays around with what we know. The characters never feel unfamiliar but theyre also different enough to be an interesting watch.
Bel-Air,1,"The inverted tone sets up a strong case for the reboot's very existence, deconstructing the veneer of '90s nostalgia for a more honest examination of class warfare within Black communities, and how they differ so greatly from coast to coast."
Bel-Air,1,"There are no weak spots in the cast; everyone brings the right authority to their role. Most crucial of course is newcomer Banks, an excellent selection."
Bel-Air,0,A confusing series that's too tied to its sitcom roots to pass for a drama to take seriously. It's unclear with its intentions and doesn't justify its existence other than to underline a new era of streaming that's starved for content.
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
Bel-Air,1,Bel-Air is an inspiring reflection of the interconnected power and joy-based resilience that is Black America.
Bel-Air,1,"If the writing can lean into the characters and let them breathe, Bel-Air will work."
Bel-Air,0,"Do we really need a cool Carlton, a sexy Uncle Phil, or a sad Will?"
Bel-Air,1,"This reboot is thoughtfully and delicately filling in the gaps that its precursor, a ’90s network sitcom created by two white writers, left behind."
Bel-Air,1,"Peacock’s reimagining of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is darker, more dramatic, and surprisingly compelling."
Bel-Air,1,"Even without it looking back, Bel-Air’s slick confidence makes it a compelling series in its own right."
Bel-Air,0,"It’s one thing to ask whether it would be great if the Fresh Prince premise was used in service of a grittier, more dramatic take on the story; it’s another to make that twist work over the long haul."
Bel-Air,0,"The scriptwriting has to be superb, and too often here, things fall flat -- plot lines are too predictable, character motivations are slightly questionable, and the dialogue can be a bit too expositional."
Bel-Air,1,"The dialogue can sound stiff, and constant references to both the original show and Cooper’s video get tiresome. Yet it does have all the makings of a solid drama."
Bel-Air,1,"A bold reimagining that maintains the essence of the original show while exploring important social themes from an authentic, Black perspective."
Bel-Air,1,"In an era of countless reboots and revivals that we didn’t ask for nor wish to see, Bel-Air truly stands out among the crowd."
Bel-Air,1,"[It works] whether or not you’ve seen ”Fresh Prince.” In fact, it might be even better if you haven’t."
Bel-Air,0,It takes every aspect of the original show and sucks out the joy.
Bel-Air,1,"The genre shift means that Banks can’t rely on broadness to win the audience over; luckily, his performance hits the right shade of every emotion he needs to play, from top to bottom."
Bel-Air,0,It’s probably the most 2022 thing imaginable to take one adored show and reboot it in a way that feels derivative of at least a half-dozen other shows.
Bel-Air,1,"This new take bucks the odds and plays for audiences new and old, proving the resilience of a premise that works even when the approach is “flipped turned upside down.”"
Bel-Air,0,"It has many of the familiar tropes of 21st-century teen drama, and none is used to particularly gripping effect: the petty sexual jealousies and earnest melodrama quickly start to grate."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"It's really well-crafted. I mean, it's well-written. The production is lavish. The costumes are amazing. Watching these episodes, you're kind of transported back to a time with a lot of turning points for modern society."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Downton Abbey isn't trying to change the face of television, so let's just enjoy the loveliness while it lasts."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,he nation will no doubt be grateful to see its favourite escapist fantasy deigning to engage with our piffling contemporary anxieties.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,The acting. The set design. The costumes. The sharp writing. The attention to detail. All of it came together in a way that made this show more than just another period drama.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Certainly Downton had its soapy moments. But for most fans, I don't think this was the series' chief appeal. Rather, it was the moments of kindness."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The Earl of Grantham having made a tectonic plate shift in his mind set over a myriad of matters. He's up to speed with the changes of the century, but are the fans, as we prepare to say our final good byes?"
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,While the upcoming season is uneven -- there are a few awfully wobbly moments in the saggy middle hours -- the series is well on its way to going out in a manner that will have its fans sweetening their cups of tea with salty tears.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Downton Abbey may strike some as an unbearably fussy and silly affair, but it has also fully and richly answered that little boy's question: They lived that way out of a sense of duty. And while it lasted, wasn't it grand?"
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"What seems clear, as Downton strolls toward the finish line, is that the show's influence will reverberate well beyond its five-year run."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,It isn't a spoiler to point out that what was true from the beginning holds true now: creator Julian Fellowes seems to love these characters and he seems determined to do right by them.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Even though it was feeling a bit threadbare in recent years, its classy departure is likely to leave its legions of fans pining for more. Golly gumdrops, what will we do without it?"
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Downton Abbey has always been television to luxuriate in, and its final season will delight fans with more of the same superb production quality and writing that makes the aristocratic Crawley family feel part of our own."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The final Downton season is satisfying, engaging and nostalgic. And if there is, at some point, a movie? You know we'll be watching."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,The final season of the popular series with more changes than ever in store for the characters.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The sixth and final season of the series delivers happy endings all around, as if rewarding viewers for their devotion to the lives of the wealthy and the service classes alike."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Even when the series drifts towards the boring or trite, its exemplary cast and the endearing characters they play are enough to hold our attention."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,Our love for the characters enables us to overlook the vexing problems in the script.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,The characterizations are beginning to get cartoonish.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,An air of change and the sense of an era ending threads through the first episode... a terrific hour that winds up several long-running stories while stoking a few new ones as the series marks its final run of episodes.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Beautiful, elegant final ride, full of love and nostalgia and joy. The only way to go..."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"The [first] episode ends with a coming-together that will delight the show's die-hard fans - and help carry the rest of us through the overly sentimental reunions, unlikely outbursts, kidnappings and, yes, sudden deaths."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Downton simply continues its sharp observations of human behavior among fundamentally decent people, as animated by some of the loveliest faces, voices, and cinematography on the tube, it still has much to offer."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Suffice to say, Fellowes steams ahead as a quality purveyor of British confectionary."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,A proper ending for a unique and memorable ensemble drama that has had a few ups and downs over the years.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"For a series set almost 100 years ago, the storylines were surprisingly relevant today."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"It's loop-the-loop loopy, but also exciting; the fun Fellowes is having is infectious."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,The season is best when it attends to the fears and fury of those in the underclass at risk of becoming even more marginalized by social flux.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"Despite the sadness over the end of our Downton addiction, please try to enjoy this great last season ... It's the best one yet, with many happy and sad revelations."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,The year is 1925 and the times they are a-changin' - and creator Julian Fellowes really wants to make sure you know that.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,Fellowes hints at drama and pulls his punches.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,1,"I'm happy to report (without any spoilers) that it remains what it has been for years - a pretty melodrama, whose characters we've come to know well, grounded in a thought-provoking historical moment."
Angelyne,1,"Rossum is utterly captivating, finding nuance in a character who’s an icon — even if it’s only in her mind."
Angelyne,1,"Like the Los Angeles billboard icon at the heart of it, the unconventional bioseries is whatever you want it to be—and Emmy Rossum is acting her heart off..."
Angelyne,1,Maybe Angelyne is an idol made of plastic. But what’s so great about authenticity?
Angelyne,1,"The approach is mockumentary style, however it isn't mocking its subject -- respect is shown and her positive light is celebrated."
Angelyne,1,"Features an entertaining, lively performance by an almost unrecognizable Emmy Rossum in the title role."
Angelyne,1,"This is a vibrant series that’s more interested in the stories that people tell themselves than it is in cold hard facts. And in its own way, that’s the most truthful way to look at someone’s life."
Angelyne,1,"The storytelling of Angelyne leaves a lot to be desired, but Rossum’s performance cuts through the script gymnastics..."
Angelyne,1,"Anchored by a superb leading performance and a deft understanding of what its subject represents, Angelyne is a must-watch for Angelenos and celebrity novices alike."
Angelyne,1,"If anything, Angelyne commits to the work of humanizing formerly maligned sex symbols beyond the surface level. If the largest sex organ is truly the brain, both Angelyne the series and Angelyne, the woman, know that."
Angelyne,0,"Angelyne approximates its subject in the wrong ways: It's big, attention-getting and has all the depth of a billboard."
Angelyne,1,"Actress Emmy Rossum is clearly having a blast portraying the various chapters of the enigmatic woman’s life story, but she tempers the performance from devolving into the cartoonish."
Angelyne,1,"Thanks in large part to Rossum’s deeply sympathetic and almost protective performance, “Angelyne” turns Angelyne into the kind of star she always wanted to be."
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
Angelyne,1,"Where Angelyne most succeeds, however, is when it echoes the same carefully constructed campiness of its subject rather than try to create gravitas from the ground up."
Angelyne,1,"With the entire five-episode run premiering at once, audiences can binge this funny, weird, and touching story that turns an iconic pin-up into an icon. This is a very entertaining tale that has more depth than I ever expected."
Angelyne,0,Rarely makes for more than a fitfully engrossing watch.
Angelyne,1,"Rossum and her masterful team of collaborators fully understood the assignment, and created an immersive experience that is equal parts fun, tragic, magical, offbeat, and just as unique as its subject."
Angelyne,1,"All these different layers of evasiveness, kaleidoscopic perspectives, and slivers of self-mythology feel like what Angelyne might have wanted."
Angelyne,1,"Angelyne makes merry play of the lines between identity and delusion, and does it with all the bubbly verve of the real-life figure it’s digging at. It’s brilliant stuff."
Angelyne,1,Angelyne doesn’t debunk every myth about the local legend; no series ever could. But this technicolor portrait of Hollywood’s sweet-yet-spicy hometown hero offers something almost better.
Angelyne,1,"There's an endearing level of protectiveness in Rossum's performance, and indeed the entire production. 'Angelyne' is funny, but Angelyne is never the butt of the joke."
Angelyne,1,"[Spicer and Tcherniak] can’t always build momentum in the series’ sluggish openers, but as the series gets loopier, with sci-fi elements and Brechtian theatrical pastiche, they hold the mish-mash between drama, comedy and anything-goes together."
Killing It,1,"It's easy to slide through and laugh along with the sitcom's snake-filled first season in one sitting, and to buy everything it's pitching."
Killing It,1,"Though just a touch above a middling comedy, viewers will have a few laughs and might also learn a bit about the phenomenon of ""banking while Black..."""
Killing It,1,"The best of them is Killing It has Craig Robinson as a guy who decides to become a snake hunter in Florida. Better than his last sitcom try, NBC’s Mr. Robinson, this one is raunchier, since it’s not on a network."
Killing It,1,"Killing It gets off to a rough but promising start, thanks to a fun performance from Robinson, with an assist from O’Doherty. We hope that as the story gets more personal, the characters will outshine the gags."
Killing It,0,"Unfortunately, [Killing It] is no Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It doesn’t have the snap, crackle and pop in the dialogue, the density of gags, the brilliantly drawn characters or the magic casting."
Killing It,1,"At a meta level, every episode feels like a satirical exploration of some different aspect of life in modern America."
Killing It,1,"Tossing out society’s expectation of kindness, camaraderie, and citizenship is a dark path that also creates narrative possibility, and Killing It slithers steadily upon it."
Killing It,1,"Killing It‘s comedy only rarely rises to laugh-out-loud levels of hilarity, but the odd-couple dynamic between Jillian and Craig makes for a breezy ride."
Ray Donovan,1,"This might be the season where everyone finally exiles Mickey, realizing that he's pure poison."
Ray Donovan,1,"If this elegiac season has been about what's been lost, it's also been about how trauma and tragedy will never truly stay buried."
The Fall,1,"This is not how I imagined The Fall concluding... It's both futile and poetic, I suppose. And surprising -- I'll give creator and executive producer Allan Cubitt that."
The Fall,0,This year's series has been the natural conclusion of the race to the bottom.
The Fall,1,"Cubitt has found more to explore; perhaps six episodes is stretching it too far, but Anderson's magnificent, controlled performance is worth tuning in for again and again."
The Fall,1,A worthy send off for the series.
The Fall,1,"The Fall needed an actor who could play charming and wicked with equal panache, who could hold his own against Gillian Anderson. For all his talents, Dornan is not that actor."
The Fall,0,"If Season 3 is the last season of Netflix's The Fall, it went out on a strange note."
The Fall,0,"For all its psychological, almost literary complexity, it loses much of its narrative steam. It's that great 21st-century phenomenon: a show that's more fun to think about than it is to watch."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The Fall,1,"Season 3 does a passable job ending the story, but you have to watch the other seasons first."
The Fall,1,"The Fall was back for another bout of sadistic psychological chess played out between Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson, subjecting viewers to its usual unbearable tension but in the opposite way we expected."
The Fall,0,"Between the spurts of sparse dialogue, dragged-out shots of dimly-lit rooms and corridors (a regrettable legacy of Scandi noir), and long periods of staring into space, there was enough padding here to insulate an attic."
The Fall,1,The atmosphere is stiflingly tense.
The Fall,1,Worth a watch for viewers familiar with the series.
The Fall,0,It's a frustrating end to a frustrating season.
The Fall,1,"When it's firing on all cylinders, though, the third season of The Fall is an unusually meditative, self-possessed piece of television, one that actually earns the ""psychological thriller"" title."
The Fall,1,"What was hard to watch became unworthy in Season 3, and that's a fall we simply can't bear."
The Fall,1,"There is a fantasy here, an almost-misandrist one in the best possible sense."
The Fall,1,"This is The Fall, which doesn't squander opportunities to show off its mastery of the slow burn."
The Fall,1,Allan Cubitt certainly knows how to hook an audience.
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
The Fall,1,"Mr. Cubitt's unconventional methods mix standard police thriller elements of detection and chase with long, quiet scenes of conversation, interrogation and surveillance."
The Fall,0,"Its hallmark traits of knife-edge tension, sexual discussion and psychologically-charged scenes have been posted missing, and replaced with an hour of medical procedures and jargon that would bore the most ardent of E.R. fans."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Well-written with some inspired production design and a great ensemble cast, I consider Battlestar Galactica one of the best sci-fi television series ever"
Battlestar Galactica,1,"The last ten episodes of Battlestar Galactica deliver plenty of puzzles, prophecies and dreams; answer questions and raise others; and pay off characters in satisfying and usually surprising ways."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"There are certainly a number of issues that continue to haunt the show, but the story is infinitely fascinating regardless and we can't wait to see how things play out."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"The mutiny storyline was the highlight of the season, which overall had an unusual number of highs and lows - there were very strong episodes and storylines throughout, but usually some noteworthy weaker elements would also show up along the way."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"With a renewed sense of purpose and enthusiasm season four is more cohesive and creatively invigorating than the third installment of the series, which often felt disjointed and needlessly didactic."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"This final season of BSG surely contains many faults, most of which are the direct result of mysteries the show had imposed on itself. But when it comes time to send off the crew of Galactica, it is done in the small moments, just as it should be."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"It's a relief to have the series back to pick up a strange, uneven TV season."
Battlestar Galactica,1,The return of Battlestar Galactica reminds us why it's so often considered one of the best shows on television.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Most of what's in these ten episodes seems designed to get your hopes up even while the showrunners are busy dashing them, and perhaps most noticeable is the fact that the show has become more depressing and fatalistic than ever."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"There was some disappointment, yes, but god damned the episode was absolutely breathtaking. On the whole, it was a relatively worthy conclusion to a groundbreaking series, albeit with a manipulative coda."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"After anxious months of geeky Web speculation over how Battlestar's final season will conclude, the best thing about ""He That Believeth in Me"" was how it bypassed our feverish expectations and instead set up new central conflicts."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"The series continues to transcend the sci-fi genre and bring out real emotions, social issues and conflict."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"And even though this particular episode may not have been able to clear the yawning chasm of our expectations, it was an appropriate conclusion to one of the most poignant, smart and relevant television shows of the last decade."
Battlestar Galactica,1,I don't mean to sound flippant. I kind of like the audacity of a sci-fi series getting this explicitly spiritual in explaining its mythology.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"For a series that had always used familiar trappings of sci-fi like robots and spaceships to comment on our present-day circumstances, it was the perfect final sequence."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Tonight's Battlestar Galactica finale was a cop out, but it was also the perfect goodbye. Ron Moore dropped the ball on plot but as always, the show delivered where it really mattered."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"So, overall, I was fully satisfied with the ending, and I don't feel like I wasted four seasons of televisions."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Tonight's episode is superb, and barrels - relentlessly - toward the answers."
Battlestar Galactica,0,"To be honest, I'm weary of Baltar and his endless visions/hallucinations, as I am of the fleet's wandering as the surviving colonists try, somewhat fitfully, to find their way back to a home planet none of them remembers."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Season Four, broadcast in two chunks with a climbing-the-wall break due to the writers' strike, proved the most challenging, soul-searching and devastatingly turbulent yet."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"The thing with shows such as BSG and the brilliant cop drama The Wire is that they set the bar so high in terms of sheer entertainment, that it is almost impossible for them to consistently deliver the levels of excellence we've greedily come to expect."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Yes there were missteps, but this will be remembered as a show delivering compelling, emotional moments in nearly every episode, along with some of the most layered and thought-provoking situations and characters you'd find on television."
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
Battlestar Galactica,1,There is no doubt that the tour-de-force performance of Edward James Olmos as Admiral William Adama will rank among the best heroes in TV history.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Much has been made of the show's embrace of major social themes and plot points that recalled current events, but it also combined a heady brew of pulp fiction, religious mysticism and solid character drama."
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"My take on the Battlestar Galactica series finale was that it was 99% incredibly satisfying and delivered beyond what I was hoping for. In the end, it seems destiny will be what it will be, much like fighting gravity."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, Battlestar Galactica finished with something approaching a happy ending."
Battlestar Galactica,1,Battlestar is never more enjoyable than when Mary McDonnell's President Laura Roslin is spouting this stuff to a dubious but smitten Adama.
Battlestar Galactica,1,Battlestar Galactica remains the best drama nobody seems to be watching.
Battlestar Galactica,1,The action has enough flavor to make clear what's at stake with the personal dramas.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Even if you're skeptical of science fiction, ""Battlestar Galactica"" will make a true believer out of you."
Battlestar Galactica,1,The dilemmas on the drama have many parallels in the real world.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"It is to the Sci Fi Channel what ""The Sopranos"" is to HBO, a show that defied all expectations and became that rarest of beasts: a big, fat hit with a cult following."
Battlestar Galactica,1,Battlestar Galatica has defied the odds.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Jumping back for its last batch of episodes, ""Battlestar Galactica"" continues its improbable ascent from a mediocre 1970s footnote to one of the more intriguing episodic hours of the 21st century."
Battlestar Galactica,1,The multitude of exegeses and theories devoted to major plot twists and minor details attest to the series's enduring egghead appeal.
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Riveting as ever, ""Battlestar Galactica"" proves again that sci fi doesn't have to be clap trap."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Buddy, your show's been on for 12 seasons. Don't you want to send off your characters in any type of meaningful way? Nah. Let's just use the time to get back at someone for something people have long forgotten about."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
Two and a Half Men,1,"May not have been great art, but it was an amusingly self-conscious conclusion built around an unfulfilled promise that at least punished the principals responsible for that unfulfilled promise."
Two and a Half Men,1,"Was it appropriate? Classy? I just know I laughed. Great TV or no, Two and a Half Men ended its many lucrative years in a way true to its nature: going for the punchlines, laughing at death, as expensive objects rained from the sky."
Two and a Half Men,0,Was that the sound of a piano crashing down on the hopes and dreams of 10 million fans?
Two and a Half Men,0,"So really, was Two and a Half Men just a regular sitcom, or was it the greatest episode of Black Mirror ever about a bunch of actors stuck forever inside a sitcom of hell."
Two and a Half Men,0,"A big, crude and unapologetically vulgar finale. In other words, it ended the only way it knew how."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Just say ""goodbye"" and leave the ""good riddance"" to Sheen."
Two and a Half Men,1,"Whether you liked the finale or not, the show doesn't care. It, and Chuck Lorre, went out on the exact notes it wanted to end. And that note, as far as Lorre was concerned, was a #winning one."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Seemingly designed less to provide closure than as an extended rejoinder to those who have criticized ""Men"" through the years."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
Two and a Half Men,1,Two and a Half Men has always been a sturdy little sitcom.
Resident Alien,1,"Resident Alien is still a hoot, and I’m digging the current “Harry in New York City” storyline. But the show isn’t perfect, and some of the human subplots have been lacking ..."
Resident Alien,1,Resident Alien's strength lies with its ability to develop characters. It's a rarity among comedies to have so many fully-fleshed characters you wholeheartedly support.
Resident Alien,1,"It's still amusing, but the premiere didn't contain the laugh-out-loud scenes of early Season 1 episodes."
Resident Alien,1,"This season brings in more heart, humor, and drama. Alan Tudyk somehow got even better in this role, which felt impossible after season 1."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me aims high, but ends up howling at the moon with some deeply implausible parental angst"
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me might claim to be a TV show, but its really a movie. (A short one, at that.)"
Wolf Like Me,1,Wolf Like Me is right up there with the likes of Russian Doll for just smart and fun storytelling that brings the surreal into the very real.
Wolf Like Me,0,The first three episodes mildly intrigued me – but not enough to want to continue.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Before things take a supernatural turn, they play out like an afternoon Hallmark Channel weepie."
Wolf Like Me,0,"So bad it's good? No, just the former..."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Is it a love story? A story about redemtion? About creating a trusting, loving family after tragedy has visited the home? It's hard to know what's really going on here, or why it's going on."
Wolf Like Me,1,Isla Fisher's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
Wolf Like Me,1,Wolf Like Me might just be the unexpected viewing highlight of your summer.
Wolf Like Me,1,"The show is, in a way, about magic – and to make that click, it needs to have its own magic. Gad and Fisher bring it. There’s a playfulness here that gives it energy."
Wolf Like Me,0,Wolf Like Me takes its traumatic situation so seriously I kept waiting for it to let its hair down.
Wolf Like Me,1,"The six-episode series is so charming, disarming and odd it's almost a work of magic. And, as with any magic trick, the delight depends on not knowing how it's going to work."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Wolf Like Me is a delightful surprise. As as monster love story that resonates with genuine emotion and sharp psychology, it plays against type by being a drama first and foremost."
Wolf Like Me,0,The show is heavy handed [...] without actually delivering
Wolf Like Me,0,"It has a true bleeding heart, gushier than a lot of other rom-coms, but it could use a lot more bite."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Wolf Like Me is more drama than comedy, but it works either way, despite its strange premise. Much of that is thanks to Gad and Fisher, but it's also because Forsythe has ground the show's more supernatural elements in reality."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Held up next to others of its kind, Wolf Like Me may not do enough to cement itself in memory, but it's an unexpectedly heartfelt tale..."
Wolf Like Me,1,"While I won't spoil the twist for you here, let's just say that it works because Wolf Like Me never tries to be a genre bait-and-switch but rather uses elements from multiple types of stories to deliver a satisfying narrative."
Wolf Like Me,1,"A show that takes a moment to pin down, but feels wonderfully richer the deeper you go."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Fisher's always possessed the talent of a leading lady in projects like The Great Gatsby and Arrested Development. Here, she plays up a tender heart hiding behind wall of quick-witted jokes."
Wolf Like Me,1,"Whether you want to find Wolf Like Me utterly serious or likably silly, it's all there in [Fisher's] performance, which made me laugh and tear up in equal measure."
Wolf Like Me,1,...Abe Forsythe brings the same brand of humor to the series as he did to Little Monsters.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me's supernatural elements are its weakest parts, delivered in wispy terms that make them indistinct and generic."
Wolf Like Me,0,"""Wolf Like Me"" is more of a bummer than a fun watch."
Wolf Like Me,1,"While the first two episodes require a healthy dose of patience, it's worth holding on for the remaining four, where the show stops relying on mystery and the two main characters lay it all on the line, for the audience and each other."
Bates Motel,1,"The Cord was crazy and unpredictable and emotional, and gave audiences one of the series' creepiest moments in the past/present juxtaposition"
Bates Motel,1,"It was all creepy as hell, but it was an 'aww' kind of creepy. The creepiest creepy 'aww' ever, but still we can't help but say it. Aww. Rest in peace, Norman."
Bates Motel,1,I came late to the Bates Motel saga not having discovered the show until the third season. What pulled me in was Norma and Norman's weird and wacky relationship. You couldn't have one without the other.
Bates Motel,1,A suitably tragic and elegant close.
Bates Motel,1,"None of us were really expecting a happy ending to Bates Motel, were we?"
Bates Motel,1,"In its final season, Bates Motel proved over and over again that it is one of the few series on television that can simultaneously subvert predictions, exceed expectations and make every shocking twist feel completely earned."
Bates Motel,1,This final season was thoughtful and provocative end to a complex multi-year tragedy.
Bates Motel,1,"This final incarnation of Bates Motel still has all the strengths of the earlier years, but now with a real sense of shape and purpose."
Bates Motel,1,"Of course, the fun in Bates Motel is in perverting that sweetness until its outright rancid, but The Cord wants viewers to remember that this was a show that was driven by love at the end of the day."
Bates Motel,1,It's amazing Bates Motel ended as well as it did.
Bates Motel,1,"For Bates Motel, such a fitting end may seem antithetical to a series with so many shocks, but it should help the series stand up over time"
Bates Motel,1,"Few shows are better in their second half than their first, but there's no question that seasons four and five of Bates Motel were superior to two and three."
Bates Motel,1,"From its pitch-perfect production and costume designs to its well written arc of ebbing climaxes and violent episodes, ""Bates Motel"" cooks on all burners."
Bates Motel,1,"Farmiga has given one of the best performances on TV for Bates Motel's entire run, as both ""real"" Norma and the version that lives in Norman's head."
Bates Motel,1,I'm not sure where the end of [Romero's] story will lead but I'm excited to see it play out.
Bates Motel,1,"Rare is the movie adaptation that is not just excellent, but which becomes its own radiant achievement. It doesn't seem too early to bestow that praise upon Bates Motel."
Bates Motel,1,"While season 5 appears poised to tell the story of a schizophrenic killer trying to remain in the shadows, what's even more exciting about the final chapter is that it's clear the exploration of Norman Bates is not yet complete."
Bates Motel,1,Thanks to the four years of accumulated backstory that's come before -- along with the ongoing knowledge of where this ends -- even the most incidental moments take on additional emotional weight.
Bates Motel,1,"The creepiest, best moments are still those focused on Norman and the now-deceased Norma as Norman moves ever closer to the Norman Bates of Psycho fame."
Bates Motel,1,"'Bates Motel' is moody, emotional, tense, and occasionally absolutely horrifying. Like Norman, it is not to be underestimated."
Bates Motel,1,Bates Motel season 5 is an exciting and refreshing take on the Psycho mythology and continues to be a showcase for the outstanding cast.
Girls5eva,1,"There's power and self-reflection, ridiculousness and earnestness, determination and heart in everything about this series, music, jokes, characters and storylines included — and it just keeps proving a laugh-a-minute gem to watch."
Girls5eva,1,"Getting the balance right is tricky, but the show pulls it off. There is so much joy to be found in every episode..."
Girls5eva,1,"Even if Girls5eva weren’t densely layered with witty pop cultural references in the manner of 30 Rock, so that rewatching is rewarding, and even if it weren’t buoyed by well-written awful songs... I’d be smitten thanks to the Goldsberry’s performance."
Girls5eva,1,"Every episode is so thick with genuinely hilarious moments, it’s easy to just roll your eyes at the SNL-ness of the ones that don’t land."
Girls5eva,1,"It’s not immediately delivering the kind of sublimely satirical songs that made the first season such a masterpiece. It’s still great fun, though, as the middle-aged survivors of ’90s girl band Girls5eva continue their shaky comeback."
Girls5eva,1,"Stick with it, and it turns out the plot arcs and emotional beats guiding the eight new episodes are rather solid..."
Girls5eva,1,"In its second season, Girls5eva is as goofy and entertaining as ever, a showcase for some seriously funny women and infectious ear worms."
Girls5eva,1,Season 2 proves that the show isn’t even close to running out of steam — each plot point is deliberately designed to take these characters in the most exciting and satisfying direction possible.
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
Girls5eva,1,"It can be a challenge to stay invested in those story threads amidst a barrage of punchlines and musical parodies, but that never feels like a negative."
Girls5eva,1,Girls5eva is the comedy oasis the world needs right now.
Girls5eva,1,"Girls5eva season two manages to hit all the same highs, while expanding its range ever so slightly to make room for earnest self-reflection among all those goofy jokes."
Girls5eva,1,It’s a show that’s found its groove and is exceptionally comfortable in it.
Girls5eva,1,"Full of funny, likable characters who've deepened throughout the two seasons without sacrificing any of their inherent ridiculousness."
Girls5eva,1,"When given a second chance at selfhood or celebrity, which would you choose? In this highly satisfying sophomore season, Girls5eva says yes to both."
Girls5eva,1,Girls5eva’s satirization of the music industry and pop culture ephemera remains as splendid as ever.
Girls5eva,1,"Like the group itself, it knows what it wants to say and it makes no apologies for it. The songs remain great and catchy, and from top to bottom the series winningly mixes together low-key humor with laugh-out-loud moments."
30 Rock,1,[A] poignant farewell to an era.
30 Rock,0,"The good news is there's a host of amazing cameos from Salma Hayek, Julianne Moore... But they're sometimes not very funny, and the whole thing has the feel of a rushed comedy riff whipped off over too many cups of coffee."
30 Rock,1,"30 Rock could coast on the goodwill generated by the knockout, surprisingly moving Liz Lemon wedding episode but it seems intent on regaining its former glory as it roars its way to a conclusion."
30 Rock,1,"The best thing about the final season is that, like the entire series, it was never perfect. But the fact that it felt different than any other sitcom was part of its appeal. And that energy is evident in the final episodes."
30 Rock,1,"Uproariously funny and also -- dare I say it -- beautifully poignant. Well done, Lemon, well done. You'll get no eye-rolling from me."
30 Rock,1,"I'm genuinely sad to lose my Thursdays with this awesomely dense comedy, which amounted to a grenade made of zingers."
30 Rock,1,"While many might have expected a sendoff in the fashion of the oft-compared-to Mary Tyler Moore Show, with the entire TGS family tearfully embracing as the studio goes dark, 30 Rock stayed true to its bizarre heart."
30 Rock,1,"Happily, Tina Fey is running this manic circus, rising to the occasion with a final hour of self-referential zaniness that finds many fruitfully funny and characteristically twisted variations on the theme of saying goodbye."
30 Rock,1,"Manages to maintain the joke-dense nature of 30 Rock to the very end, with enough callbacks to satisfy any fan. And the media satire is sharp to the very last."
30 Rock,1,"In taking on the greed, ineptitude and ego rampant in the boardroom, Fey created the most radically subversive satire of the oft-satirized TV business ever."
30 Rock,1,"At the moment, network TV is relatively rich with farce... 30 Rock operates at several orders of magnitude higher."
30 Rock,1,At its worst it was good. At its best it was transcendent. It's not enough to say that 30 Rock didn't die. Its whole life was thunder.
30 Rock,1,"On a purely joke-for-joke basis the seven seasons of Tina Fey's TV industry satire might be the best US sitcom of all time. Based on Fey's own experiences as a Saturday Night Live head writer, this was democratic ensemble farce of the highest calibre."
30 Rock,1,"As bright, light and taut as a miracle fiber. The jokes -- smart, surreal jabs at culture and politics -- never let up."
30 Rock,1,"Liz Lemon was flawed and complex, but she was also witty and smart and no-nonsense, especially when it came to herself. We relate to her because she made our most basic and common flaws hilarious to watch every week."
30 Rock,1,"Most long-running sitcoms fade away, but Liz Lemon didn't run out of juice."
30 Rock,1,"It was one of the most satisfying sitcom enders I've seen, right up there with the end of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cheers, series that operated along the same no-fuss, let's-all-have-a-good-time wavelength."
30 Rock,0,"Anyone returning, hoping for the old Rock rather than the new, is bound to be disappointed in this strained outing."
30 Rock,1,"No show before 30 Rock commented as astutely on television culture as it mocked NBC and terrible TV trends (""MILF Island,"" anyone?). For that alone, 30 Rock deserves the thanks of a grateful nation."
30 Rock,1,"Through seven seasons, loving ""30 Rock"" always seemed like evidence that one's brain and heart were connected perfectly."
30 Rock,1,"What I'll miss most when 30 Rock is gone is the conduit it provided into whatever was on Fey's mind. As 30 Rock found its way and sharpened its blade, Fey became the unofficial spokeswoman for a niche demographic."
30 Rock,1,"Man, with 30 Rock almost over, who will we look to on NBC to mercilessly mock NBC?"
30 Rock,1,The anchor of 30 Rock has always been the friendship between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy which is a pairing that has only gotten stronger now that there's mutual respect between them.
30 Rock,1,"So: funny funny, and full of well-chosen guest appearances and cameos. But above all there was a sweetness to the episode."
30 Rock,1,"All great things must come to an end, and 6 1/2 seasons seems like a reasonable life span for this great thing -- packed with wordplay, sight gags, pop-culture tangents and assorted other odds and ends."
30 Rock,1,I respect Tina Fey's desire to end the show while it's still good. But an episode like this one just reminds me of how much I'm going to miss 30 Rock when it's gone.
30 Rock,1,"I suspect that much of this season will be about Lemon and Jack trying to tank the network, and that promises to be a comedy goldmine."
30 Rock,1,"Live From Studio 6H was one of if not the funniest episode of the season, and the concept was also on point."
30 Rock,1,"Each episode of 30 Rock suggests a Hollywood blockbuster condensed to a half-hour, every sensible plot development seemingly replaced by an absurd twist."
30 Rock,1,Looks like Liz Lemon's going out in a blaze of glory. Blerg...we miss her already.
Psych,1,"The outing is not immune to the overall sloppiness that crept into Psych in its later years, but it's sweet and appropriately conclusive - and it has enough of the series' early virtues to remind those who liked it what they liked about it."
Psych,1,"I reckon everyone who watched ""Lock, Stock"" had [a] smashing time anyway."
Psych,0,"Even though it's had a successful run over almost nine years at this point, Psych looks like it's sustained by perpetual motion, not by the excitement of producing entertaining television."
Psych,1,"Psych opened its eighth season with an episode that was largely a standalone, Juliet-less outing removed from continuity...yet one that was a special kind of ""magical"" nonetheless."
Psych,1,"It was probably a good thing that Psych didn't attempt a big, splashy finale. The dressed-down version was the perfect way to end this series, to bookend what Psych was always about: relationships between characters and a boy growing up."
Psych,1,"It was mostly a fun ride which, also like Monk, managed to create a nifty ensemble as well."
Psych,1,"The real triumph of Psych is that it has lasted eight seasons, since it hails from a TV genre of absurd and sometimes silly humor that often wears out its welcome quickly."
Psych,1,"Few shows display the level of unbridled, free-form silliness that Psych had."
Psych,1,"To call an episode of Psych ""funny"" is kind of redundant. In fact, I think the dictionary should now just have a picture of Shawn and Gus as the definition of the word ""funny."""
Psych,1,"After what feels like the longest hiatus in the history of cable television, our favorite psychic and his black friend have FINALLY returned to primetime - and with jolly good installment to boot!"
The Endgame,1,"This is pretty standard primetime crime/thriller fare, but its twist has potential."
The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes."
The Endgame,0,"We’ve been down this road before, but at least this one is paved in Baccarin’s dark lipstick and wry, self-assured grins."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is the sort of show that believes it can compete with an international hit like Money Heist by staging seven simultaneous bank takeovers, while giving us precious little reason to care what happens in any of them."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
The Endgame,1,"The Endgame makes enough of the right moves to inspire curiosity about where this intricate scheme ultimately leads. While it doesn't tell you much about its endgame, as this sort of exercise goes, that's a good place to start."
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge."
The Endgame,1,"Conceptually familiar, narratively overambitious, and yet somehow still enjoyable... defies easy dismissal thanks to the uncontainable charisma of Morena Baccarin."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
The Endgame,1,"The Endgame is a crackerjack of a caper show, a tautly edited blend of action and wit that blows along like a runaway train."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
The Office,1,"It's worth taking a trip to the darker, more depressing, awkward, uncomfortable, and just plain sad version of The Office that started it all: the original."
The Office,1,"The humor's slightly darker than the American version, with more focus on characters' dissatisfaction with their dead-end job at a paper company, and Ricky Gervais steals every scene he's in as David Brent, the bumbling boss."
The Office,1,"The genius of the show is Gervais, who also writes and directs, putting the vile Brent into situations that are ripe for disaster - and promptly turn out much worse than anyone could have imagined."
The Office,1,It is all unspeakably beautiful.
The Office,1,The Office is a remarkable piece of TV history - a genuine institution of comedy and creativity that has inspired more television series than most.
The Office,1,What is so endearing and hilarious about the show is the utter honesty captured by the camera.
The Office,1,"Fortunately the BBC series (2001-'03), totaling about eight hours, has been collected on DVD, and this marathon screening offers neophytes a chance to immerse themselves in its black humor and disarming pathos."
The Office,1,"Although you'll never forget that The Office is fake, one aspect of the show feels very real: It captures the blend of frustration and tedium that makes up the bulk of most people's lives."
The Office,1,"Written and directed by star Gervais and Stephen Merchant, ""The Office"" stings with its depiction of office politics and personalities at their most petulant."
The Office,1,"But if we are to take The Office as a perfect artistic expression of the passions, desires and fears of our age, like a Michelangelo painting but on telly and starring a fat bloke, what makes it what it is?"
The Office,1,"Throughout all 14 episodes of the British series, we never once believe that what we are seeing couldn't ever happen in an actual office."
The Office,1,"t's a hilarious, funny, terrific show, but it's also a deeply sad one, a comic tragedy that puts the emphasis on the latter word in the final two episodes of its second series."
The Office,1,The Office is most appealing when it's most appalling.
The Office,1,The Office still feels unique in its commitment to the bleak monotony of the average British working day.
The Office,1,But perhaps what was most surprising was that a comedy set in the average workplace appealed so much to us - people too young to have spent much time in one. It proved good comedy is universal and eternal.
A.P. Bio,1,"This kind of humor, rife with wackiness and second-hand embarrassment, has become a trademark of the series and the laughs are nearly always on point, even when viewers are wincing at the same time."
Heroes,0,"Once again, then, an error-riddled and confusingly-plotted episode of Heroes where everyone acted out of character, which, by this point, can be considered entirely consistent with their previous appearances."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
Heroes,1,"With the fourth and final season going back to basics, as well as injecting some much needed warmth and depth into several previously underdeveloped characters, Heroes definitely went out with a bang."
Heroes,1,"Season 4 was not the rebirth of Heroes, but it improved the series enough to prove that there is still a lot of potential."
Heroes,0,"The fourth season of Heroes ended not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a collective synchronized shrug."
Heroes,0,It's legitimately incomprehensible that the show's producers have jobs.
Heroes,0,"Ideas so ill-conceived and poorly executed, you'd think the show was written by committee and the writers had given up-really been phonin' it in there for quite some time."
The Purge,1,This season knows how to combine the suburban nightmare of the first part with the frenetic sequences and the political and social complications. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Purge,1,"The shift effectively creates a brave new world... where the writers are given a chance to more fully explore the consequences of that single 12-hour period, and to draw a more complete picture of a world."
The Purge,1,"The acting throughout is solid, and Tim Andrew has always been a reliable hand in the director's chair, both with actors and with the general feel and tone of an episode."
The Purge,1,"Yes, we got subjected to another round of kill or be killed on Purge night, but the promise of The Purge Season 2 Episode 1 is that with another 364 days to go before the commencement of the next Purge, we're in unfamiliar territory."
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
Brave New World,1,"To the likely dismay of Huxley purists, Peacock's Brave New World is sexy, gorgeous, and exciting, a feast of visual and sensory delights that's often purposely empty in its portrayal of purposely empty people."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
Brave New World,1,"Although [Alden Ehrenreich] again does not have a hit on his hands (the series got cancelled after one season), Brave New World remains a watchable escapist fantasy."
Brave New World,1,"Regardless of whether you are familiar with the novel or not, this is a world that is very easy to escape into, and by doing so the series demands we ask bigger questions about the nature of escape itself."
Brave New World,1,Dystopian sci-fi series is heavy on sex and violence.
Brave New World,0,Disastrously walked into every known pitfall of trying to turn what is essentially a philosophical discourse into gripping drama. Even mediocre drama would have been a start.
Brave New World,1,"I like the look of it, even if it's not the stand out show we've seen in the last few months, I will certainly keep watching it."
Brave New World,1,"Brown Findlay and Lloyd are likeable leads, and we root for them even though they are explicitly lacking in emotion."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
Brave New World,1,"Made with great visual oomph and a clever tweaking of Huxley's plotting, it is, ironically, top-grade escapism while lingering on Huxley's satiric depiction of a society soothed and manipulated by pleasure and drugs."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
Brave New World,0,"The cast is good. The writing is mediocre. It hews closely to Aldous Huxley's novel, except when it departs from it. There are a surprisingly large amount of orgies, and yet, they are in no way the reason to watch or not to watch Brave New World."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World is all flash and no substance. It looks good but that's about as far as it goes. It isn't really interested in getting too deep into how the world operates because that's not where its priorities lie.
Brave New World,0,"Temperamentally so right-wing that I wish it were better. As it is, the series is merely tolerable, hampered by a lead-you-around-by-the-nose quality that is more in keeping with the network-TV ethos than with top-shelf cable drama."
Brave New World,0,"Not only have we had a ton of sci-fi dystopias lately, but Huxley's novel is one of the most popular and enduring ever; most of the stuff you're sick of was already cribbed from it in the first place. That puts this new series in a tricky position"
Brave New World,1,"As far as summer shows go, Brave New World might be ideal, and it scores points because it can be appreciated on multiple levels."
Brave New World,1,Brave New World rings false in the same simple way its novel does now: capitalism just got bigger and more inhumane.
Brave New World,0,"Brave New World is caught in a feedback loop of references, one that only occasionally resonates with a culture in the midst of challenging systems, unseen and otherwise."
Brave New World,0,"There is nothing particularly brave, new, or urgent about this monotonous sex, drugs, and caste system saturated vision of a future New London."
Brave New World,0,"""Antiseptic"" doesn't begin to describe it."
Brave New World,1,"As pure entertainment ""Brave New World"" is well-paced and features a strong cast... We are just left wondering what the show wants to say or cares about."
Brave New World,1,"Brave New World offers a relatively breezy way to examine timeless issues of class consciousness and escapism, just relevant enough to not feel like the meaningless amusements it preaches against."
Brave New World,0,"Slick, expensive-looking and with the biggest name behind it, ""Brave"" should have been Peacock's best offering, but instead is its biggest flop."
Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much."
Brave New World,1,"With fresh plotting, an expanded focus, and after updating a few outdated themes, this ""Brave New World"" is very different from the book. But when you're trying to make a new thing out of an old thing, that can be OK."
Brave New World,0,"While it looks pretty, it feels thin. Entire stretches are given over to PG-rated orgies instead of clearly explaining the plot. Moreover, a TV series where audiences are supposed to sympathize with the bored and unhappy one percent feels out of touch."
Brave New World,1,"Interesting looking and provocative in its themes, Brave New World starts out with considerable promise and doesn't end nearly as well; still, at least the show feels big, strange and slightly different."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
Brave New World,1,Brave New World succeeds mostly as a rainbow-colored spectacle one can easily sit with despite the violence and empty sex appeal... or perhaps because of it.
Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish]
Brave New World,0,"[Brave New World] could have gone in any wild direction it wanted, but it opted for a take that feels like the safest possible outcome."
Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting."
Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World plays it safe and rehearses empty criticisms that are undone by its own content and platform.
Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is begging for discussion, and there's a lot to unpack."
Brave New World,1,"There's a lot of talk about the ""social body"" in a lavish new limited-series adaptation of Brave New World... But it's the many scantily clad bodies writhing in orgiastic abandon that you might remember after watching this sleek and sensual depiction."
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
Brave New World,1,"""Brave New World"" isn't bad - what remain of Huxley's central ideas here are still relevant and important. They're just presented in a such a muted way you wind up thinking of another Rolling Stones song, about wanting more satisfaction."
Brave New World,0,There's nothing brave or new to see here.
Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials."
Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex."
Brave New World,0,"It's not an immediately gripping techno-satire, nor a mindbending puzzle box. It's not an impressive sci-fi world, nor a bold piece of sex-violence-profanity prestige. It's just a disappointing adaptation trying to be everything for everyone."
Brave New World,1,"Whether by showrunner David Weiner's design or network notes, the show lightens up, allowing for more moments of dark humor but also some weird character turns."
Brave New World,1,"A well-made, thoughtful show, succumbing only occasionally to the silliness of its extreme premise. That is about as much as you can ask from a debuting drama series in this moment of content."
Brave New World,1,"Though the ""Westworld"" parallel applies to the affluent creeps-exploiting-the-poor in an amusement park narrative, ""Brave New World"" is much more rewarding to watch."
Brave New World,0,"The series looks gorgeous, and expensive, even if its sci-fi brutalist aesthetic is a bit generic. The performances are solid, too... Yet something is missing from the show's core... I struggled to get invested in this bunch."
Brave New World,1,"By the time the romantic triangle heats up, Brave New World has successfully put the ""soap"" back in ""dystopia."" I swear that pun works if you take the right pills."
Brave New World,1,"...don't expect to hear Huxley's famous phrase ""orgy-porgy,"" nor is there much use of a scent organ to rev up the alphas and beta pluses pushing them into a frothy sexual peak. There's no sex hormone chewing gum, either-such a pity."
Brave New World,0,"Both Brown Findlay and Ehrenreich seem frustratingly tamped-down here... No wonder the actors seem exhausted; their project, deep into its first season, doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be."
Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is essentially an analysis of compassion ⁠and how much the constructs of our society can get in the way of that. Amid a global pandemic and countless other issues in our world, that sentiment feels more relevant than ever."
Brave New World,1,"Brave New World is less about philosophy and more about slick, sexy sci-fi storytelling. It's not high art, but it is a truly fun and raucous watch."
Brave New World,1,"It's a well-made and thought-provoking adaptation, even if it could be a little braver."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World has too many parts out of place to be a success - and stripped out one of the most important parts that would have made it a success.
Brave New World,1,Brave New World is summer viewing at it's finest: decadent and sexy with just enough depth to keep you engaged during the hottest days of the year.
Dr. Death,1,"Grim viewing — and gripping, anxiety-riddled, cliffhanger-filled and highly bingeable viewing, too."
Dr. Death,1,Driven by Joshua Jackson's surprising performance. [Full review in Spanish]
Dr. Death,1,Jackson is great as a wannabe genius descending into a self-created hell.
Dr. Death,1,"As this compelling series reminds us time and time again, despite Duntsch's obvious personality issues, the true villain of the piece is the system that let him practice for so long, and continues to allow other equally dangerous medics to do so."
Dr. Death,1,"While this summer's horror movies are doing their best to scare us, none of them will come close to giving me the chills that the operating room scenes in the new Peacock series ""Dr. Death"" do."
Dr. Death,1,"Digging into Christopher Duntsch's personal and professional life, Dr. Death paints a detailed portrait of a possible sociopath."
Dr. Death,1,"There are times where it feels like the show is preying on you. There are repeated loud, visceral surgery scenes where bones crack and blood gushes."
Dr. Death,1,"Director of the first two episodes, Maggie Kiley (Dirty John) does a magnificent job of throwing the audience into the unfolding mystery and horror as Henderson and company uncover the full extent of Duntsch's malpractices."
Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death is as entertaining as it is enraging, although anyone with a history of dealing with inadequate medical professionals may find it triggering (also triggering is the sound that surgical hammers make when striking the spine)."
Dr. Death,1,"We have a lot of reservations about Dr. Death, but considering the show will examine just how a butcher like Duntsch can keep getting hired by major hospitals who should be vetting their hires better, we'll keep watching."
Dr. Death,1,"Hats off to Macmanus and directors Maggie Kiley, Jennifer Morrison and So Yong Kim for their ambitious vision, not to mention the ace cast. At the same time, it's a shame that Dr. Death is too often so dull."
Dr. Death,1,"Jackson captures Duntsch's god complex and fragile ego, and while this means it's going to be easy to hate the doctor with every fiber of your being, that's the point."
Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death succeeds at presenting us with a dark, terrifying story complete with one hell of a villain. There's no doubt that Joshua Jackson is perfectly cast. It'll take some time before I'm ready to see him in anything else."
Dr. Death,1,"This adaptation manages to improve on its source material, perhaps because the story of Dr. Christopher Duntsch is so monstrous, it must be seen to be believed."
Dr. Death,1,"It hardly matters if the series around him understands Duntsch, because Jackson plays him with chilling consistency, so committed to his character's commitment to his own brilliance and infallibility that you occasionally find yourself believing."
Dr. Death,1,The limited series is more unnerving than any horror movie.
Dr. Death,1,"Dr. Death is an easy binge, but a hard watch. The traumatizing surgeries are just that, and Jackson finds just the right balance of dark ambiguity in his performance."
Dr. Death,1,"The series' excursions into Duntsch's past make the emerging picture all the more disturbing. With roles for the likes of Kelsey Grammer and Grace Gummer, it's highly bingeable stuff."
Dr. Death,1,The generally underrated Joshua Jackson carries Dr. Death with a fascinating blend of idiotic confidence and nonchalant sociopathology.
Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center."
Dr. Death,1,"The most striking aspect of this story, perhaps, is the current of plausibility that runs through it all, that says this is what can happen, this is what did happen to the victims of someone revered as an authority, like Duntsch."
Dr. Death,1,The what and the how are harrowing enough. Dr. Death succeeds by focusing on the people who fought for years to make sure Christopher Duntsch could do no more harm.
Dr. Death,1,"The show offers a stark warning that viewers will surely keep in mind the next time they require surgery, no matter how routine."
Dr. Death,1,"With an ending that anyone could easily Google, Dr. Death still manages to keep you engaged to find out if Duntsch gets what is coming to him."
Dr. Death,0,"Duntsch never adds up to a character we can understand, and standing back and wondering just how far beyond our understanding some people can be doesn't fly as the takeaway for eight hours' worth of entertainment."
Weeds,0,"Pour one out to Showtime's Weeds, y'all. But not the good stuff. The show no longer deserves it."
Weeds,0,"The show had been through so many time jumps and location changes, it was hard to know which state or decade we were supposed to be in, and even harder to care."
Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.
Weeds,1,"The entire premiere was a win for Weeds, which has had a rough past few seasons. But if there's any time to get the show back on track, it is now -- just in time for a proper ending."
Weeds,0,"What was once a contained and quirky -- though sometimes dark -- comedy about a mess of a woman, has become a global disaster."
Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.
Weeds,1,"While I wouldn't say I'm optimistic about this season, the certainty of its place in Weeds' larger narrative makes it considerably more palatable."
Weeds,1,"Weeds does manage to maintain the dry humor that made it a hit to begin with, and this isn't the brand of listless cynicism we get from lesser comedy writers content to appear savvy and hip."
Weeds,1,"I'm all in for the final season, I'll do my best to keep an open mind, but perhaps Weeds and Nancy would have been best served if they were not revived."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Monk,1,There are many fabulous stand-alone episodes in season eight.
Monk,1,"It's the TV equivalent of comfort food, and there aren't many shows you can say that about anymore. Now there's one less."
Monk,1,Everything neatly wrapped up - just like Monk folding his laundry.
Monk,1,"I won't miss Monk all that terribly, but I will miss knowing that the show was out there, creating a safe haven for people who just wanted a few smiles on a Friday night."
Monk,1,The performance that Tony Shalhoub gave as a close-to-death Monk was simply amazing.
Monk,1,"Here's to you Mr. Monk, a small and steady light on an often blinding, hyperkinetic screen. In your own quiet way, you have changed our lives and you will be missed."
Monk,1,Monk slowly evolved from a tightly-constructed mystery show into a more entertaining character study.
Monk,1,"Like a great old band going for one final tour, the final season of Monk promises to play all the greatest hits and go out on a high note."
Monk,0,"So, in its final season, Monk stays close to the formula that made it successful, offering more of the same."
Monk,0,"The finale summed up the reasons why lots of people loved this series, and why I and other people thought it had all become repetitive and silly."
Monk,1,"A good balance for the final season, giving fans time to enjoy some of the typical, lighter mystery-of-the-week episodes and then wrapping the series up by tying together all of the loose ends with Monk and the other characters."
Covert Affairs,1,Please let there be a sixth season of Covert Affairs. I need to know if Annie wears a gun under her wedding dress.
Covert Affairs,1,"Episode 16 was for the most part, a low-key season finale. The writers did really well bringing a lot of stories to a potential close. It was a bit worrying that the wrap-up didn't kick in until the final 10 minutes."
Covert Affairs,1,"Full of implausibilities, but engaging all the same."
Covert Affairs,1,"This season of Covert Affairs is going to be the first one without a Henry Wilcox storyline, and I couldn't be happier."
Covert Affairs,1,"The evil terrorist forces of the world are obviously ready, considering the explosive nature of the episode."
Covert Affairs,1,"The season premiere was a well-paced introductory episode which effectively brought Annie back, while launching a new mystery and case."
Covert Affairs,1,[Annie's] assignment takes a twist that should keep the agency on edge for most of the season. I'm in.
Covert Affairs,1,"Not a bad start to Season 5, Covert Affairs. Not bad at all."
Treadstone,1,"Spy fun, but don't say the B-word."
Treadstone,1,"It's like a Jason Bourne movie squared, cubed and extruded every which way as this compelling new series takes Robert Ludlum's Bourne trilogy mythology to places it's never been."
Treadstone,0,It's all a clone of the same idea. [Full Review in Spanish]
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
Treadstone,0,"On a technical level, Treadstone has a lot going for it. The action quality is there. The bombastic energy is there. The espionage element is there. But, the show really needs to shed its unwillingness to be a part of the universe audiences know and love."
Treadstone,0,"Disappointing action spin-off is violent, has cursing."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
Treadstone,1,"It is fine for what it is, but nothing about it really justifies it's existence. You won't be bored watching Treadstone but you may not stick with it long enough to get the answers you seek."
Treadstone,1,"In Treadstone we have more distraction than emotional resonance, sold with the fantasy of precision-driven, expert violence. No doubt, this is a vintage approach. It also feels right for right now."
Treadstone,1,"I don't know how long an action series can keep this up, but the premiere, at least, is intense, mysterious, and oddly electrifying."
Treadstone,1,"The biggest positive about Treadstone is that it doesn't play out like a TV show. With the intense fight scenes, exhilarating chase sequences, and everything else, it felt like I was watching a big-budget movie."
Treadstone,1,"Parkouring its way on to screens with far more vim and purpose than one would expect, Treadstone is a scrappy but stimulating surprise and a refreshingly necessary addition to the saga."
Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch."
Treadstone,1,There's really only one thing you need to know about the new USA series Treadstone: the fight scenes are incredibly dope.
Treadstone,0,"While lots of action films require the audience to suspend disbelief at times, Treadstone requires them to saw the tops of their own heads off and remove the gooey blob inside. It's the only way you'll survive the writing."
Treadstone,1,"Treadstone proceeds a little too slowly in terms of connecting the dots, but the show doesn't scrimp on action, and those who enjoyed the movies should find tantalizing threads in this expansion of the narrative."
Treadstone,0,A forgettable espionage drama with a tenuous connection to a popular character who never appears and is never mentioned.
Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It isn't particularly entertaining, but chances are Joe vs. Carole will succeed at making you wonder why the series was even produced, let alone stretched over eight episodes."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters."
Joe vs Carole,1,"My recommendation is to check it out for McKinnon and Mitchell, but after one episode you may have seen all you need. If you stick around for the full eight episodes, you will be entertained but you wont garner much else you didnt already know."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give it their best in a series that offers too little, too late."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Later in the season, Joe yells, “Nobody watches ‘Duck Dynasty’ for the ducks!” This show is all ducks."
Joe vs Carole,1,"John Cameron Mitchell and Kate McKinnon have a roar with ""Joe vs. Carole,"" but the series offers little of substance."
Joe vs Carole,0,"While Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give the title characters some heart in Peacock series, this tired saga should be retired with the Zoom Happy Hours."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite some clever writing and decent performances, Joe Vs. Carole can’t really add to the craziness that the real-life Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin showed in Tiger King and all of its offshoots."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole is competently made and entertaining enough but having already sat through the first season of Netflix’s bloated Tiger King, Joe vs. Carole can’t help but feel like a rerun of something I already saw."
Joe vs Carole,1,"For all its extravagance and wildness, it may turn out to be more sensitive than the Netflix series."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and Joe vs Carole feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's Tiger King, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite."
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
Joe vs Carole,0,It has little purpose than to remind you of the first time you learned about this incredible saga.
Joe vs Carole,0,You can see why Tiger Kings initial mass popular appeal lead to this drama being pitched  its a lot more difficult to see why anyone thought that appeal might sustain during the time it actually takes to make eight hours of television.
Joe vs Carole,1,"This might, in fact, be a better telling of the “Tiger King” story than “Tiger King” was, or at least a classier one with clearer morals."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole, despite some decent performances and effective directing from Justin Tipping, rarely justifies its existence."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite ""untold story"" claims, Joe vs. Carole is dedicated to the already extensively chronicled exploits of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It’s not that the series isn’t good, though it really isn’t. It’s that with the abundant oversaturation of Tiger King having come and gone, what more can be done?"
Joe vs Carole,1,"If Tiger King was your version of the tale, Joe vs. Carole feels more like your parents' version of the story."
Joe vs Carole,1,"Joe vs. Carole can offer more empathy for its subjects. They may be their own worst enemies when they go in front of cameras, but these actors and filmmakers can see their souls."
Joe vs Carole,1,McKinnon and her co-producers must be credited for conveying the tale in as serious-minded a fashion as possible. In so doing they have achieved something the original Netflix documentary had little interest in attempting.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Coming out a full two years after the cultural rubbernecking that made Netflix’s Tiger King a brief sensation, the show’s refusal or inability to streamline the themes and narrative of this story has gone from innocuous to grievous."
Joe vs Carole,1,"Just when you think TV has nowhere to go with the antihero, along comes this American original. He’s hard to like, but good luck averting your eyes."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
Joe vs Carole,1,"It isn't shocking or sensational any more, and it isn't that funny either. Why is it worth your while going over this well-trodden ground once again, and is it even fair to the show's real-life subjects to give them this black comedy treatment?"
The Capture,1,"The Capture is frightening, a little brainy, and damning of those who refuse to recognize deepfakery for the crisis it has become."
The Capture,1,"Clever military mystery thriller features violence, sex."
The Capture,1,The Capture shows that such technological leaps of faith come with a downside. The production shows that with great technology comes great responsibility.
The Capture,1,"This thoughtful but still thrilling series is a worthwhile watch that may leave you a little shaken, wanting to make sure your computer cameras are covered ... just in case."
The Capture,1,"This is the rare thriller that is not just smart and gripping, but also deeply engaged with our bizarre, often terrifying present. And it's easily the best original show you'll find on Peacock."
The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't actually anything new, but what it is... is a very well well-crafted take on telling a compelling tale of a former military man condemned by footage of a crime committed on the streets of London."
The Capture,1,The conspiracy aspects of The Capture are intriguing enough to keep us watching.
The Capture,1,"A bit convoluted, but for aficionados of British crime drama, reasonably entertaining."
The Capture,1,"We've seen plenty of this jittery, ""how deep does thing go"" investigation before. But The Capture at least adds a bit of newness in the way it considers a specific kind of technology."
The Capture,1,"It doesn't necessarily try to copy Bodyguard, but I think has definitely got that Bodyguard-type-vibe. So if you're a fan of that, you'll be a fan of this."
The Capture,1,A terrifically twisty and intensely suspenseful six-part spy thriller.
The Capture,1,"The Capture will make you question everything you believe you know to be true, as it gives credence to fake news and media manipulation."
The Capture,1,"This is a great-looking, well-paced, timely thriller, with excellent work by Turner, Haddock and Grainger, and scene-grabbing supporting work from Ron Perlman and Famke Janssen."
The Capture,0,"Offers a whiplash-inducing premiere that goes from, ""This is a ridiculous investigation that appears to lack a crime"" to ""How is that possible?""... A somewhat dubious premise."
The Capture,1,"While the show starts off strong and conjures up twisty cliffhanger endings, it falters in the end due to the convoluted plot. However, with only six episodes, The Capture is just gripping enough to binge in one sitting."
The Capture,0,"The series sucks the juice out of its pop-cultural reference points, failing to mine our current nightmares on its own terms."
The Capture,1,"With strong performances and an unabashed willingness to state its points plainly, The Capture suggests solid possibilities for Peacock as a space for shows that are brainier than can thrive on broadcast TV but still retain broadcast's punch and verve."
The Capture,1,"By turns enthralling and suspenseful, The Capture is the sort of show one could easily binge in an afternoon."
The Capture,1,Holliday Grainger is great in her turn as a moody detective who is desperate for the truth. But for most people The Capture is the sort of thriller you will be happy to binge watch now and later happy to forget.
The Capture,1,You will whip through it in a sitting because it's that thrilling but you won't sleep well after watching this because you'll know things.
The Capture,1,"What starts out looking like a punchy female-driven crime drama in which a cocky young detective stands to learn about being a woman in the ""job"" from her new superior, has shifted into a righteous crusade against conspiracy at the highest level."
The Capture,1,"In the end, as an intricately woven plot - often thrillingly anchored in the issue of constant surveillance - moves toward its final revelation, you could say it's about powerful people manipulating less powerful people."
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
The Capture,1,What The Capture achieves is not only a complex reflection on the truth about images and the ethical limits in societies under surveillance but also a thriller of a dizzying rhythm. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't perfect, but it clears a higher bar than most of the genre. And the lead performances are all good enough to steer us through any unevenness. It's well worth a look."
The Capture,1,"Ben Chanan, who originated the script and directed it himself, is a television dramatist to watch, and watch again."
The Capture,1,"The show has developed into a fascinatingly twisty thriller, centering around the disturbingly contemporary themes of total surveillance, ""deep fake"" news and political control of the justice system."
The Capture,1,I'm utterly captivated by what might possibly be in it for them. This is growing to be better than Bodyguard.
The Capture,1,[The Capture] leaves the viewer wanting more and boasts outstanding performances from its main protagonists.
The Capture,1,"It chugged along and chugged along until the final scenes, which were riveting."
The Capture,1,So far the first episode has done enough to suggest a decent midweek shaggy-dog story for back-to-school season.
The Capture,1,"By the end, with wheels within wheels beginning to spin, things are set up nicely."
The Capture,1,"An intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology."
The Capture,1,[Ben Chanan] taken the best elements of a classic conspiracy thriller and welded them to the urgently topical theme of how video footage is being manipulated to create false narratives and fake news.
The Capture,1,"The BBC has promoted this as the successor to Bodyguard. It's subtler, slower and much less starry, devoid of suicide bombers and sheets of flame, let alone Keeley Hawes as an oversexed Home Secretary. But it promises to be equally gripping."
The Capture,1,It's already gripping and I'll tune in next week as Carey searches for the victim.
The Capture,1,"It is a rather tired idea, thankfully downplayed against the far more exciting backdrop of digital jiggery-pokery and layers of subterfuge, with surveillance teams themselves being surveilled."
The Capture,1,"The Capture isn't the first drama to make images its primary currency - from Enemy of the State (1998) back to Blow Up (1966), the genre has a distinguished lineage - but it feels like a good time to revisit it"
The Capture,1,"The question of what she has seen is the carrot that dangles before us, pulling us through the rest of an hour that without it would threaten to be very lacklustre indeed."
Vigil,1,"An exciting, twisty thriller in an unusual setting..."
Vigil,1,This is a visually beautiful series with keen direction by James Strong and Isabelle Sieb.
Vigil,1,"As much as Vigil captivated British TV audiences with its superb acting and exciting twists, its most important contribution was bringing the submarine out of a 30-year voyage to the depths of cultural irrelevancy."
Vigil,1,Solid performances from the cast. [Full review in Spanish]
Vigil,1,"The character-driven British series combines elements of a police procedural with military high drama to create an intense, suspense-filled viewing experience."
Vigil,1,The unique setting of Vigil makes it stand out from the many UK-based police procedurals out there. We just hope that the show focuses on the claustrophobia of the sub and doesn't get bogged down in other story elements that might prove to be distracting.
Vigil,1,One of the better thriller series of the year and one in which a tangled web of intrigues is made as believable as the fathomless ability of humans to complicate a situation -- at least long enough to last a satisfying six episodes.
Vigil,1,"The confined-space aspect is used to wonderful effect, the characters are engaging and, you know, if you throw in a Russian submarine, too, you've got a killer, six-part thriller."
Vigil,1,The rhythm is impeccable up until the third episode... but everything works. [Full review in Spanish]
Vigil,0,"The most credible thing that came out of anyone's mouth was Suranne Jones's post-traumatic vomit. Harsh, yes, but as the closing credits rolled I had many questions, chief among them: after six long hours, was that it?"
Vigil,1,"I am very worried about where this show is heading, plot wise - not in a bad way! Just tension wise!"
Vigil,1,"Once you commit, and you know you will, be prepared to see this Vigil all the way through."
Vigil,1,"Watching Vigil has been a journey. Episode one? What a simply excellent show, I must watch this every week. Episode two? Oooh Vigil. Are you watching Vigil? You must watch Vigil. Episode three? Hmmm. Bit silly."
Vigil,0,"The artificial, strained, implausible plot twists and turns come and go, giving the Sunday night BBC TV audience their fix of ersatz tension and brainwashing."
Vigil,1,"This is, in a nutshell, a straight-down-the-line conspiracy thriller, with the Navy having something to hide, Burke as whistleblower, and Silva as truth-getter. But I never properly bought it... That said, I am still on board."
Vigil,1,"No-one is going to give this set-up Das Boot, particularly after a corker of an opening episode."
Vigil,1,"Vigil comes with a certain uncanny documentary streak, brutal and indubitably chilling."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Vigil,1,A taut mystery with intriguingly murky depths. Sunday nights are stressful again -- I wouldn't have it any other way.
Vigil,1,Vigil has everything it needs.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,A surprisingly welcome reboot of a franchise that seemed to have already been tidily wrapped up.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"Despite a fractured narrative... events move at a fair clip, an engaging, easy mix of puzzle-solving and danger dodging."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"""The Lost Symbol"" feels like something you'd watch on Saturday morning cable when the remote is lost, though Peacock might be hoping to secure fans of the ""Librarians"" franchise, too."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"This type of storytelling, where much of the emphasis has to be placed on worldbuilding and exposition, might not scratch the itch for fans of the genre."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"Throughout these first three episodes, they feed the audience just enough bits of information to get us all hooked and coming back for more. In that regard, it plays just like Brown's adventure stories."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,It certainly seems like it'll have a lot of action and adventure and not burden the audience with a ton of backstory. We just hope the show doesn't get repetitive.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"Of course it's wacky and completely unrealistic, but considering it's basically an adult Carmen SanDiego CD-ROM game, that is exactly the appeal."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Viewers who can suspend their disbelief about that setup may be able to enjoy this conspiracy thriller that feels, frustratingly, like a wild goose chase."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,"If The Lost Symbol plays it right, the series will capture the same delight that the books did, as we tag along with Langdon as he solves this mystery. ""As Above, So Below"" sets the series off on the right track."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Ashley Zukerman's Robert Langdon is an acceptable ""everyman"" hero with twinges of academic arrogance and situational awkwardness, but the overall mystery feels derivative and dopey."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"You have a show of very handsomely designed interiors - museums, galleries, Masonic temples and whatnot - and then actors squinting and explaining. No matter how outlandish the topic of the discussions, there isn't enough oxygen in the room to sustain."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,1,All of the building blocks are here but there is just something missing. Fans of the books may find this adaptation to be a far more satisfying take on the source material but it still fails to be a rollicking adventure.
Parenthood,1,The writers opted to take most story lines where fans hoped they would go.
Parenthood,1,"The whole finale is fantasy camp, but that's just the way it had to be."
Parenthood,0,"The writers' decision to go full cheeseball ending shouldn't have been surprising, after the show spent its last year turning into a frustrating shadow of itself."
Parenthood,1,"The Bravermans left their mark on us in a way not many families do -- especially on TV -- and for that we'll be forever grateful, even through our tearful goodbye."
Parenthood,1,This was a standout show that produced a standout finale.
Parenthood,1,"Like any family drama, Parenthood tells an old story, but it's done it with thoughtful attention to a central question: What is a family for? What is a parent's job?"
Parenthood,1,"The show's creators have stealthily, quietly carved out a cast of characters who defy gender clichés, on both sides."
Parenthood,1,"It's been the most sincere program on television, often mocked for its many scenes ending in tears, but never relenting in its goal to present parenthood as a difficult yet ultimately rewarding adventure."
Parenthood,1,"In other words: if you didn't cry this week, not to worry. Jason Katims and co. were just building. And if they continue to do that properly, the tears will come."
Parenthood,1,"Because Howard and longtime producing partner Brian Grazer are at the helm, Parenthood seems to be getting the care and feeding it deserves -- and the cast is peppered with proven performers who can deliver the goods."
Parenthood,1,"""Parenthood"" was so lovable that everything it did wrong felt like an exasperating yet predictable outrage -- in other words, it felt like family."
Parenthood,1,Parenthood is one of the most frustrating shows I've ever loved.
Parenthood,1,"The beauty of the Bravermans is that over the course of six seasons, they came to feel like our family, too. It's only natural to want what's best for your family. And we got it."
Parenthood,1,"The parents of Parenthood, who include old-school TV guy Ron Howard, can be proud of how the kid turned out."
Parenthood,1,"It's this aspect of this show, the unwaveringly honesty depiction of family life, whether triumphant or tragic, that makes Parenthood so relatable to so many."
Parenthood,1,"The first hour of Parenthood's final season found the Braverman clan dealing with a number of thoroughly grown-up changes, all of them eliciting reactions ranging from, ""How could she?!"" to ""Can someone pass the Kleenex?"""
Parenthood,1,"Last night's premiere may not have been the typical tear jerker episode of Parenthood, but I did get a little weepy."
Parenthood,1,I hope we'll continue to have more great father/son moments with Zeek and Crosby. Their relationship is my favorite.
Parenthood,1,"Welcome back, Parenthood. I'm so glad you're still here."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Stories about outsiders are inherently powerful, because the odds are stacked up against the characters. The leads of this British comedy-drama are a triple minority: they are women, they are Muslim, and they are first-generation immigrants."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Short, pithy and outrageously funny."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"A bonafide smash hit. Centered around five Muslim women from various MENA backgrounds, We Are Lady Parts gives us nuanced, complex depictions of Muslim women that we've never seen on American television before."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"In addition to winning performances, a genuinely exciting soundtrack, and brilliant bits of silliness in each episode, this penchant for failure is what uplifts We Are Lady Parts to a young queer audience's must-watch."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"We Are Lady Parts is a lot of things: exhilarating, witty, funny, scabrous, pointed, punk, sadly relevant and absolutely necessary. It's entertaining as hell, with a lively cast and a vivid, cinematic style."
We Are Lady Parts,1,It's an exuberant music comedy that sees Nida drawing on her own experiences and taking inspiration from the cultural artists that reside in London. It is unapologetically bold and a joyful celebration of the richness and diversity found in this city.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Full of smash-cuts and rapid-fire dialogue, the six-episode series is subversive and confident and almost merrily rowdy in spirit."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"There truly has never been anything like it on TV, and we need more."
We Are Lady Parts,1,Nida Manzoor's punk rock comedy We Are Lady Parts beautifully captures that the performance and expression of Muslim identity are complex and multifaceted.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Sstories like these deserve to be told, and I hope this was just their first track on a very long, very punk album."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The most electrifying, entertaining and endlessly hilarious UK sitcom in ages."
We Are Lady Parts,1,I desperately need this show to get renewed.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"While it shares some of its DNA with other British exports, We Are Lady Parts has its own voice... and it is loud, raucous and unapologetic."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Lady Parts is unhinged, unashamedly and entertainingly so -- new comedy turned up to 11."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Bold and irreverent, this thoughtful, well-written series challenges conventional stereotypes about Muslim women."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"""We Are Lady Parts"" captures the spirit of punk rock in a way that's both entertaining and resonant."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"""Lady Parts"" is a thoughtful and purposeful step forward in greater representation that also evinces a deep skepticism of the oft-simplistic, outrage-based representation politics so common online today."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"It accomplishes more than so many fatter series -- a full story arc, a sense of cultural depth, a strong female gaze, a group of winning songs -- in only three-or-so hours. The six half-hour episodes are a triumph of reach and representation."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Nida Manzoor has created a thoroughly modern, relevant and witty celebration of feminine individualism, sisterhood and community."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The wickedly funny series delves into the surreal, thanks to Amina's elaborate fantasies and day dreams. The five women share an easy, warm chemistry, which comes through in their music."
We Are Lady Parts,1,We Are Lady Parts is an absolute delight with my only complaint against it being that there's just a single short season available on streaming.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Each member of the greater Lady Parts quintet could easily handle an episode on their own, and Vasan and Impey are certainly no exception."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The main critique for We Are Lady Parts remains that it is too short. I want eight episodes, or 10, or 50."
We Are Lady Parts,1,The season is swift but so rewarding that I watched it twice.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"It's the joy with which Manzoor designs We Are Lady Parts that grabs you by the shoulders and makes you appreciate its wildness, same as any other rock legend committed to film or TV."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"American TV and film has never been as bold, or as thorough, in its depiction of Muslim women as Manzoor's half-hour comedy."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"There is a lot to love about We Are Lady Parts. The dialogue is sharp and funny. Vasan's performance is endearingly vulnerable... Like KISS and VU before them, Lady Parts are here to rock."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"I mean, lady parts? Sheer balls, if you ask me. I haven't seen anything like this on British television before."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"You never get the impression that Manzoor is trying to make a grand statement. Yet through her writing and direction, and the impressive performances, she does just that. ""We Are Lady Parts"" is meaningful. It's also a lot of fun"
We Are Lady Parts,1,"For a show with such a radical premise, We Are Lady Parts is effectively Modern Sitcom 101."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Shobu Kapoor and Madhav Sharma aren't series regulars, but manage to steal every scene they're in as Amina's supportive parents."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Vasan does a brilliant job of letting the character's quirky innocence evolve as she discovers the power of punk within herself, while Impey finds both the sharp edges and vulnerable sides of Saira."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Like any good punk song, We Are Lady Parts is short, intense, and unapologetic."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"This is a riotous, funny and touching series that allows the characters to break out of the traditional and stereotypical and embrace their punk selves."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"[Writer/Director Nida] Manzoor pens a thoughtful, dynamic story about a group of women that long to be heard, and she knocks it out of the park... In addition, the soundtrack is infectiously top-notch."
We Are Lady Parts,1,Delightful... a bright and brash look at a culture entirely written and directed by Nina Manzoor.
We Are Lady Parts,1,An absorbing and binge-worthy show.
We Are Lady Parts,1,What's so special about this series is that it's impossible to pigeonhole anyone or anything in it.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"A love for music is palpable throughout ""Lady Parts."""
We Are Lady Parts,1,"Make no mistake: This is a very funny show, with a cast of versatile and game performers. Anjana Vasan is a particular delight, with an innate understanding of how to get laughs just from small changes of expression, intonation, and posture."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The songs, written by Manzoor with her brother and sister, are pretty good too. And loud."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"We Are Lady Parts is an assured mix of second-generation cultural confusion and millennial feminism, one part Chewing Gum to two parts Wayne's World. Its silliness is its strength, and young and older me are thankful for it."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"If the show sometimes feels as if it's trying a bit too hard to be cool, it can be forgiven - when representations of Muslim women on screen are mostly confined to the news bulletins, at least We Are Lady Parts offers something joyful."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The mish-mash of genres gives We Are Lady Parts an irresistible anarchic energy, and its cast of characters give it plenty of heart. By the end you'll be desperate to join their gang."
We Are Lady Parts,1,"The characters created by writer-director Nida Manzoor burst into vibrant life, reminding us of the diversity of Muslim communities and of the universality of many experiences and frustrations. And those characters are funny."
Eureka,1,"""Eureka"" is as amusing and delightful as ever, but the early episodes of this final season seem to have a darker edge to them."
Eureka,1,"The sheer craziness of the moment and Carter's reaction of ""I'll worry about that tomorrow"" was all-Eureka and a perfect way to end things."
Eureka,1,Eureka was effortlessly fun and optimistic.
Eureka,1,"Eureka was too expensive a show to make for such a small audience. Fortunately, the larger than usual budget gave us five enjoyable season complete with some slick visuals"
Eureka,1,"There are many reasons to love Eureka, but massive plot twists aren't usually among them. Well, the end of last night's episode definitely qualified, as our heroes tried to figure out the dangerous secrets of virtual reality."
Eureka,1,"While it may not resonate with me as it might with fans, it truly did make me want to feel sad too."
Eureka,1,I'm relieved that everyone got their storybook ending.
Eureka,1,"The more serious stories were fine, but it was those effortlessly light, entirely un-self-serious touches that made Eureka's short five seasons such refreshing fun to watch."
Eureka,1,The actors absolutely nail some of their toughest performance challenges.
MacGruber,1,"I’m happy to report that MacGruber the series, which picks up after its lead has spent more than ten years in prison, is an improvement even on the movie."
MacGruber,1,"While the twists may be predictable and the pacing suffers from its half-hour TV format, this is a functional action thriller and fully effective comedy vehicle."
MacGruber,1,"The cast - Forte and Wiig, in particular - completely commit themselves to the absurdity of it, and therein lies the remaining joy of MacGruber: Watching great comedic actors abandon their dignity in service of a laugh."
MacGruber,1,"You could watch the movie and then go right into the show, and it feels like it's the same production... MacGruber loses nothing in the time it spent collecting dust."
MacGruber,0,"It's purposefully harebrained, repetitive, and frequently laboured, but the good news is we get to see Laurence Fishburne and Sam Elliott. You've been warned."
MacGruber,1,"An eight-part series invariably means stretching out the best material, but MacGruber devotees will be satisfied."
MacGruber,0,"It's hard to get excited for a sequel to a film that wasn't very good to begin with, especially when the sequel is three times as long."
MacGruber,1,"The action may be bigger, and the jokes slightly more ridiculous, but that's to be expected in MacGruber's biggest story yet."
MacGruber,1,Couldn't be more faithful to the character. [Full review in Spanish]
MacGruber,1,"The jump to an episodic format isn't always kind to MacGruber, which doesn't have quite enough plot to fill out its eight episodes, but even when the writing starts to go astray, the cast's commitment to this wacky premise smooths over the rough edges."
MacGruber,1,"Just in time for the holidays, get ready for a throat-ripping good time with what will hopefully be the first of many seasons of MacGruber."
MacGruber,1,"It's almost impossible to describe a big chunk of what makes MacGruber enjoyable without just listing off a string of jokes that Forte, Wiig, and a handful of other lucky guest stars get to toss in the mix."
MacGruber,1,[MacGruber] is about as stupidly funny as you would hope.
MacGruber,1,"It's Kristen Wiig as Vicki St. Elmo who steals the show, digging deep into her bag of tone-deaf accents and silly love songs."
MacGruber,1,"Because Will Forte and the rest of the cast commit to making MacGruber as serious as possible, it makes a silly show actually pretty funny."
MacGruber,0,"An unnecessary reminder that not everything that's funny for three minutes works for two hours, much less four."
MacGruber,1,"It may tax the patience of some viewers at my tier of fandom, but the fiercest of devotees will doubtlessly find MacGruber to be the MacGruberiest TV show of the year."
MacGruber,1,"MacGruber on Peacock, for all its flaws, has the same batting average the character has always had. He is, for good and for ill, the same at any length."
MacGruber,1,"MacGruber seems intended for a narrow audience whom this reviewer is not among, but the sheer vim that went into stretching a one-joke premise into an expansive riff on the action serial is hard to deny."
MacGruber,1,This series takes everything you love about the film and expands upon it. It's like getting two or three MacGruber sequels at once.
Unsolved Mysteries,1,"The other stories featured in Unsolved Mysteries do, of course, pander to a morbid interest we have in true crime, but Tsunami Spirits brings us back to reality and reminds us of those affected in these cases."
Unsolved Mysteries,1,"These reports are wild but have evidence to back them up, which makes them even more entrancing - especially as they are set against the background of Japanese culture and the way it honors those who have passed."
Unsolved Mysteries,1,"With every episode opening with its classic eerie theme song intact, ""Unsolved Mysteries"" still has the ability to be endlessly fascinating."
Unsolved Mysteries,0,Unsolved Mysteries is likely to stay but it has to do better to become a staple series on the streaming service.
Unsolved Mysteries,1,Volume two picks up where the last one left off. The Netflix revival is still a globe spanning series with some interesting stories.
Departure,1,"The second season is still well-plotted and satisfyingly mysterious as long as you're new to all this. On the other hand, the first season is better written and has Plummer."
Departure,0,"Departure Season 2 is, unfortunately, an over-complicated mess that loses sight of what made Departure Season 1 so wonderful."
American Auto,1,"A mad satire of corporate life, it is mainly set in the boardroom, where executives prove daily that they know nothing. It's got the contemporary, socially aware vibe of Superstore and has the same creative team."
American Auto,1,"It's smart and very funny after only three episodes, so if it gets an opportunity at a second season, I can only see it getting better."
American Auto,1,"I wouldn't buy a used car from these people, but I'll relish watching them dig their own graves in a future auto graveyard."
American Auto,1,"This offbeat, albeit formulaic series features an ensemble cast of semi-competent employees negotiating workplace issues while trying to keep their inept company afloat."
American Auto,1,There's enough promise to American Auto to keep us watching when it starts its regular timeslot in January. But the show really needs to get beyond workplace comedy archetypes if it's really going to shine.
American Auto,1,"[A] smart, promising show."
American Auto,1,"Like Gasteyer, the rest of American Auto's cast is uniformly hilarious. But the laughs come zooming out of all directions on American Auto."
American Auto,1,Can't help but feel like an unofficial companion piece to Spitzer's Superstore - but from the other end of the corporate hierarchy.
American Auto,1,"While ""American Auto"" feels like it's having some early engine trouble, it's worth taking this new ride into the shop for a tune-up."
American Auto,1,"The ensemble is strong -- White and Dyer are appealing, and Michael B. Washington's measured delivery is always a treat. And if the show's attempts to exhibit real edge may make viewers cringe, Gasteyer provides a strong reason to keep watching."
American Auto,1,"Funny and fast-paced, this single-camera comedy is worth a test drive."
Warehouse 13,1,"The cancellation of this entertaining series may not seem fair, but tonight it seems faire..."
Warehouse 13,1,"If you'd followed the show since the beginning, this was a nice send-off that summed up what made people feel so passionate about these characters."
Warehouse 13,1,"You have my attention now, Warehouse 13."
Warehouse 13,1,"It's a sci-fi/fantasy ""who's who"" as Warehouse 13 pulls out all the stops in a time-tripping free-for-all that opens the condensed fifth and final season on a boisterous note."
Warehouse 13,1,"Like all good installments of Warehouse 13, it is the smaller moments that make the show so much fun. Pete's constant need for a snack and thinking about food are still out in force, and the banter between Steve and Claudia is even more sarcastic."
Warehouse 13,1,It didn't take long for both storylines to get up and running on Monday.
Warehouse 13,1,"Everything feels more fun and it looks like the actors are enjoying every minute of their time together. Let's save our tears for the end, and focus on the positive until then."
Save Me,1,"There's a tricky tonal balance at the heart of ""Save Me,"" which blends elements of a family drama, a detective series, and even a dash of a workplace comedy thrown in for good measure."
Save Me,1,"Jones also plays the role of a mother in crisis with masterful restraint - pain concentrated in the furrow between her eyebrows. This might be familiar territory, but it's in very good hands."
Save Me,1,"Learning lessons and wisely evolving from its stylistic first series, Save Me Too is a successful sequel to what was already an obsessive mystery."
Save Me,1,"All the things I found outstanding about most of the last series: realism, naturalistic dialogue, attention to detail and confident silences."
Save Me,1,"The subject matter is distressing but never gratuitous. The focus is on the parents grieving for a lost daughter, and what to do with that grief when the news cycle and the police have moved on."
Save Me,1,"This is shaping up to be another quality instalment, and I admire James's reluctance to take the easiest path. This does mean that the question of whether anyone will find Jody, though, remains as open as ever."
Save Me,1,"Save Me Too digs deeper and takes even those familiar with series one on a journey they won't be expecting - satisfying yet surprising, it's sure to have its loyal audience hooked all over again."
Save Me,1,Far more nuanced and character-driven than many other entries in the genre.
Save Me,1,"James' triumph here is to create a cast of characters who are not great human beings, but who are believable and empathetic. The twists and turns of the narrative are completely gripping, but it is as a study in human frailty that Save Me really shines."
Save Me,1,"The performances are all superb. James is extraordinary, a tour de force, while Suranne Jones, as Jody's anguished mother, is heartbreakingly believable."
Save Me,1,"It is, if anything, better than the original, charting the toxins spread throughout an entire community via just one tiny group's sociopathic sense of sexual entitlement, and thus the disjointed distrusts that must fester and breed."
Save Me,1,"Once again, [Lennie] James is electrifying as Nelly."
Save Me,1,"This series builds to some stunning places, with real tension and surprises. It's a drama foremost, but one that happens to play all the right thriller notes, though not necessarily in the ""right"" order. The result is something original and captivating."
Save Me,1,"It's funny, clever, sometimes melancholy and often beautifully unsettling."
Save Me,1,Save Me doesn't have to make big statements; it can just watch people be people.
Project Blue Book,1,Whether this is enough to attract new viewers remains to be seen but fans should be satisfied with where the show is heading. If the showrunners could just decide whether they preferred fact or fiction they could really be on to something.
Project Blue Book,1,[I]t's as good as ever.
Saved by the Bell,1,"A show that should be only nostalgia  and I wont deny theres a big helping of that  ends up being a lot more, thanks to a combination of good, smart writing, talented actors and a lot of chemistry between the cast."
Saved by the Bell,1,"Saved by the Bell Season 2 continues to offer a story that has real substance and heart, all while poking fun of its former self in the best of ways."
Saved by the Bell,1,Season two of Saved by the Bell is sharper and more astute than the previous season.
Saved by the Bell,1,"Like season one, the second ten-episode installment makes for a rewarding, if breezy, bit of binge watching for longtime fans, while also giving space for the new characters to make their own mark."
Saved by the Bell,1,Television reboots trade off the public's long-running familiarity with their stars; kudos to this one for allowing Berkley Lauren the chance to turn the page.
Saved by the Bell,1,"It's... very, very funny, and in the second season proves even more willing to embrace its bizarre universe."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
The Bletchley Circle,1,"The mysteries [the characters] take on are often related to a personal relationship for at least one of the women, and in turn, it heightens the tension and the stakes for them all."
The Bletchley Circle,1,"This unassuming show finds a way to turn many of its limitations into virtues, and it's not hard to end up thinking of the Bletchley women as very British badasses."
The Bletchley Circle,1,"Though The Bletchley Circle is a mystery series, it's not a show to be watched for the riddles-at least, this season isn't. Instead, this is a season about re-examining the past with a feminine perspective."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Still fun on its own terms, the encore takes an unexpected little gem and transforms it into Murder, She (and She and She and She) Wrote."
The Bletchley Circle,1,It's like watching Nancy Drew grow up into Wonder Woman.
The Bletchley Circle,1,I'd like to spend a whole lot more time with the heroines of The Bletchley Circle.
Rise,1,"... takes some of ""Glee's"" exuberance and mixes it with a ""This Is Us""-style feel."
Forever,1,Episode 12: Away We Go
Forever,1,"Although the series has ""third act syndrome"" it is an authentic take on eternal love. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Forever,1,"With a distinct brand of pitch-black humor, surprising cliffhangers and an eight-part season of 30-minute episodes, Forever is an easy binge. Go see what all the fuss - or, rather, hush - is about."
Forever,1,It's wistful and hopeful and Maya Rudolph does some world-class swearing in it.
Forever,1,Not a word is spoken as viewers feel the ennui settling over [June] like a toxic cloud.
Forever,1,A profound exploration of the wondrous perils of falling in love.
Forever,1,"Armisen provides a perfect foil, while Kym Whitley...brings big energy and Catherine Keener a delightfully contrasting sharpness."
Forever,1,"Despite the profile of the actors, Forever has a real story, with soul, a touch of pessimism and also the occasional joke. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Forever,1,"A series that skilfully wrong-foots its audience repeatedly over the course of the season, and somehow manages to get both funnier and more poignant at every turn."
Forever,1,"Forever is a wonderful, truly special show."
Forever,1,"It is, after all, a mystery-of-the-week show modeled on the latest hot character trope, but it is surprisingly endearing and entertaining, with a long-form mythology that gets doled out bit by bit each week."
Forever,1,"While Forever brings Oscar and June's meandering story to a relatively satisfying conclusion, it's Sarah and Andre's heartbreaking tale that will stay with me."
Forever,1,"Like a bubble, it might be a little slight in some ways, but there's something beautiful, peaceful -- perhaps even transcendent -- about watching it drift by."
Forever,1,You'll know if this is a show for you within the first hour. After that? Things get even more interesting.
Forever,1,"For eight episodes, Forever has felt cynical about love, ungrateful even, but in its conclusion it shows a glimpse of its beating heart."
Forever,1,Forever provides Rudolph the opportunity to bring her considerable talents as a comedian... in a dramatic space. The trust is a thoroughly wounding performance that treat life's small joys and overwhelming tragedies with equal humanity.
Forever,1,"It's Maya Rudolph who does the heavy lifting here, and the series is worth watching just to witness the broad range of emotions that pass over her like rainstorms."
Forever,1,Rudolph and Armisen are fantastic in this.
Forever,1,"Surreal comedy has inventive, absurd laughs, language."
Forever,1,"Forever is a show so set on being exceptional, profound, and moving, it occasionally forgets to just be entertaining."
Forever,0,"It's like a mild-mannered reporter with a secret identity, but the secret identity is a mild-mannered marketing guy. The show sounds mysterious and alluring, until you know what it's hiding."
Forever,1,"Things turn dark, then strange, then stranger, all the while managing to combine existential despair and sweet humour."
Forever,1,"Forever is an enlightening journey into the unknown. Ignorance is most certainly bliss. Give it a watch, but don't peek."
Forever,1,"Forever tackles some big issues about life,...The half-hour show does so in a manner that cleverly pulls the viewer along from episode to episode, even if its answers, while intriguing, aren't quite equal to the buildup."
Forever,0,"The show tries to combine the more typical tropes of a marriage sitcom with the more supernatural ones it introduces with this higher concept twist, to muddled effect."
Forever,1,The writing is great and Rudolph and Armisen are as good as you'd expect.
Forever,1,"A curious, compelling treat, which in its first three episodes manages to weave an increasingly high-concept story without losing its initial low-key charm. Hopefully it'll carry on that way forever."
Forever,1,"Forever sets up a base camp on that line between intimacy and familiarity, determined not to broaden its characters into familiar TV-couple types."
Forever,1,"They're inviting us to think about marriage and change, along with other themes I'm not going to name, and their control over the entire season is admirable."
Forever,1,"A funny, poignant and even surreal exploration into the power of love and the strength of long-term commitment."
Forever,1,"When Forever wants to be funny it can be ragingly funny, especially over little things... Rudolph's mastery of disdainful swearing is truly something every time it's employed"
Forever,1,"Rudolph turns in the best work of her career, plumbing humor and pathos as a woman questioning everything about her existence."
Forever,1,"[The show] sets the couple on an existential journey like no other, one that's still universal in how it poignantly and humorously confronts the big issues of life and love."
Forever,1,"One of [Rudolph's] best performances to date, and even when Forever seems to wander into its own cul-de-sac, she remains endlessly gripping."
Forever,1,"Forever will mystify you, make you laugh, and force you to think deeply about how and why people hold themselves back from taking risks that can elevate their lives."
Forever,1,"It's easy early on to buy into their rapport. But where both have plenty of history playing larger-than-life comic figures, [Maya Rudolph]'s also terrific at playing understated real human beings, where that never plays to [Fred Armisen's] strengths."
The Americans,1,The BEST show currently on television.
The Americans,1,I get why some critics call it one of the best shows of all time.
The Americans,1,"This season really does resonate a lot with today... And it's wonderful ground, and the episodes are really interesting."
The Americans,1,"The series has always invested itself in the bonds of family and partnership, yet season six feels gloomier and more doom-laden than its precedents."
The Americans,1,The Americans will always be one of the greatest television shows ever but...[the] series finale was not one of its greatest moments.
The Americans,1,"In The Americans, music is text: harmony is an illusion and as the Crowded House song goes, ""there's a battle ahead"" that threatens to ""build a wall"" between the Jennings. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Americans,1,"In this final season, the stakes are raised with a piling body count. Let's just say this is one show which finishes stronger than it started."
The Americans,1,This FX drama delivers an unforgettable ending in this final set of episodes.
The Americans,1,"As fans themselves echo the chorus of ""Don't Dream It's Over"" as the show nears its finale, we should still feel lucky to have gotten six seasons of this truly special series."
The Americans,1,"The Americans was something special, and Weisberg created something beautiful here. Hopefully, people realize what they've missed."
The Americans,1,"The Americans treated the theme of espionage with a sharpness rarely seen in the genre, which usually prefers nonstop action, stunning twists and ""Red Sparrow""-style seduction."
The Americans,1,The Americans is a rare show that's both thrilling and also deeply perceptive about the inner lives of humans.
The Americans,1,It explores the consequences of deception and ideology on characters we can't help rooting for.
The Americans,1,"Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are better here than ever before, and a real asset in a show that's long been dedicated to the art of showing, and not telling, when it comes to the emotional evolution of its characters."
The Americans,1,A role model for any television series. [Full review in Spanish]
The Americans,1,"The Americans, like its protagonists, has been in disguise, a searching psychological drama dressed up as a kicky action play."
The Americans,1,The Americans talks far more eloquently about politics and history than I imagined it would when it started... Good for The Americans to have so presciently anticipated a cultural shift and so engagingly explored it.
The Americans,1,This terrific series promises to end with a triumphant bang - don't miss it.
The Americans,1,The Americans is still a show viewers can sink into and enjoy as an escape from the world without having to stress over any parallels.
The Americans,1,The Americans is full of great musical notes that carry complexity beyond pure sonic pleasure. But it's also just-plain fun sometimes.
The Americans,1,"The Americans, menacing as ever in its reserve, won't spell out whether it's a charmed totem or a cursed amulet."
The Americans,1,"The cinematography has always been top-notch. So has the acting. But there are hints here that all these characters, whose stubborn myopias we've come to know, are being forced to see differently."
The Americans,1,How The Americans resolves their fates will be key to whether this series is remembered as a superbly rendered morality tale or a distinct disappointment after setting its bar so high.
The Americans,1,The Americans ends even more impressively than it began.
The Americans,1,"If you've fallen away from the series because you miss the process-y spy stuff, be advised that it's back with a vengeance, here in the home stretch. Yes, the show's about issues of trust and support, but it's still got a serious body count."
The Americans,1,The good stuff is the Jennings family drama -- the way they behave with each other and present themselves to the world around them.
The Americans,1,"Watch this hour as an invested viewer, and by the time it's over, you'll be asking yourself the same question as several of its characters: Whose side am I on?"
The Americans,1,"If watching a TV show is like being in a relationship, The Americans is the closest thing to a domestic partnership that modern TV drama has ever given us."
The Americans,1,There's a certain amount of pride watching the unfolding of this last season of The Americans. There are a lot of plates spinning -- it's time to see which are saved and which are shattered.
The Americans,1,"It might be the coldest show ever made, which is why it works so well."
The Americans,1,"The history itself is no spoiler; we know how the Cold War played out. But The Americans understands history as more than the record of which nations rise and fall. It's also the story of individual people for whom life goes on, or doesn't."
The Americans,1,"The fact that the Jennings' story is ending gives this season much of its dramatic heft and importance, as characters who haven't seen each other in ages come together again, and as each choice in each personal and political maze carries more finality."
The Americans,1,Not since Breaking Bad have I felt so much acute anxiety about the fate of such compelling anti-heroes.
The Americans,1,"As always, excellent."
The Americans,1,It comes as no surprise that one of the greatest drama series in television history should come to its end as powerful as ever.
The Americans,1,"The magnitude of the espionage feels unconvincing, and the murder-happy episodes suggest they learned the wrong lesson from last year's too-slow burn. But The Americans gets more patient when it examines the widening cracks in the Jennings marriage."
Trying,1,"It's a charming little show, and a lot of that is due to the stars."
Trying,1,"Trying managed to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump in its second season when all is said and done. The writing was tighter, and the acting remained stellar, and there are many possibilities as we head into Trying Season 3."
Trying,1,"With smart, succinct, and creative writing, and comedy used in just the right proportions, Spall and Smith deliver a one of a kind show."
Trying,1,"The dialogue is consistently, genuinely funny, and the characterizations feel very authentic. ... Trying is a treat to watch."
Trying,1,The show would not work if not for the chemistry of the central couple.
Trying,1,"I'm a huge, huge fan of this series, and really excited about the second season. It picks up exactly where they left off, and it's such a winner for me."
Trying,1,"The humor, warmth, and wit that made the series' first eight episodes so joyous and engaging are equally evident in season two."
Trying,1,"Nikki and Jason are still so inherently likable no matter of their little annoyances, you just can't help but cheer them on. It's a pleasant sunny escape from the gloomy doom and 21st century pretention that so often bombards us."
Trying,1,"One is especially drawn to Smith's generosity of spirit, which has something about it of Renée Zellweger's Bridget Jones: comically acute and gentle, in turn."
Trying,1,"It's simply a wonderful series from top to bottom, and this new season is its best outing yet. You'll adore it."
Trying,1,"Through it all, ""Trying"" is a bright show. There are plenty of sunny exteriors. The inside of the car rental call center where Nikki works has more charm than most fictional offices."
Trying,1,This is a show that just plain wants you to be happy while you're watching it.
Trying,1,"A delightfully funny, wry and honest look at a London couple trying to have a baby."
Trying,1,"Season 2 is the same approach, but better."
Trying,1,"I don't actually hate it. I actually think it's kind of funny, and sometimes very funny."
Gordita Chronicles,1,"It’s interesting to see the family face struggles, stereotypes, and discrimination while still being able to maintain a wholesome and often uplifting tone. There’s also an added sprinkle of cut-throat comedy, unafraid to be wickedly socially conscious."
Gordita Chronicles,1,"Olivia Goncalves delivers a break out performance as the bold and aspirational Cucu Castelli. Savannah Nicole Ruiz, goes on a particularly profound journey of self-discovery, navigating fake friends to find her true passion."
Gordita Chronicles,1,"The humorous series, which is narrated by the now-adult journalist Cucu, is a fish-out-of-water story that highlights what life was like for many Latino immigrants who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s."
Gordita Chronicles,1,A big-hearted charmer.
Gordita Chronicles,1,"“Gordita Chronicles” is as charming as it is often obvious; indeed, one might say its obviousness is part of its charm."
Gordita Chronicles,1,"It doesn’t lose its balance -- throughout, it tells its story with an un-jaded, charmingly direct approach, aided by the excellent work of the child performers."
Made for Love,1,"Made for Love has an engine full of rage, and a sharp satirical edge, but it is also curiously thoughtful, an almost mournful meditation on the twin human needs for independence and connection."
Made for Love,1,"This is truly weird science, and a terrific series."
Made for Love,1,"Zany, sharp, and entertaining as ever, Made for Love remains one of HBO Max’s best original series."
Tuca & Bertie,1,"In its third season, Lisa Hanawalt’s critically acclaimed series is at its absolute best—wild, weird, and disarmingly insightful."
Tuca & Bertie,1,"Tuca & Bertie is a gem, and as someone who often wishes for BoJack Horseman to be back because of its commentary, this fills that void perfectly."
Tuca & Bertie,1,"They lay the groundwork for what’s sure to be a punchy, humorous, and timely season. Here’s hoping we eventually take that trip to Horseville."
Tuca & Bertie,1,"Tuca & Bertie’s third season proves that entertaining, hilarious, and downright weird television doesn’t have to sacrifice heart."
Dinosaurs,1,"Although the show was lighthearted and geared toward younger viewers, it sometimes visited heavy themes. In the memorable but very dark series finale, it touched on the themes of environmentalism and mortality."
Dinosaurs,1,"The series finale of the family-friendly dino sitcom ended on, quite possibly, the most depressing note in TV finale history."
Dinosaurs,1,[Dinosaurs] was the very pinnacle of hilarity.
Dinosaurs,1,"For all its rounded-off edges and at-times-unseemly reach for commercial appeal, the show retained a core of ""Henson-ness"" that made it always just a little funky."
Dinosaurs,1,"As one might expect, some [episodes] are better than others but, overall, seasons three and four really showcase the show's strengths."
The Great,1,"McNamara’s writing remains cheekily brimful of lexical and copulatory energy, with added dabs of surrealism – witness the crocodile on the loose in the palace."
The Great,1,Season 2 of The Great leans into its most obvious asset: the delectably doltish turn by Nicholas Hoult as Russian emperor Peter.
The Great,1,"It's zany, hilarious, and at times, feels like an elaborate and ambitious workplace sitcom. In short, The Great was the show I was most eager to hit play on in 2021. Here's to creator and head writer Tony McNamara - huzzah!"
The Great,1,The thing about The Great is that it's so delicious. It's so decadent. It's so naughty.
The Great,1,"Clever, irreverent, and touching, Season 2 establishes The Great as one of the best comedies on television right now. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and heartbreak -- a masterful feat."
The Great,1,"Clever, funny, but in-your-face offensive, it's an acquired taste, but, if you acquire it, you'll be coming back for more."
The Great,1,"Showrunner Tony McNamara's creation continues to be a perfectly pitched satire, filled with witty bon mots and showcasing two terrific performances by Hoult and Fanning."
The Great,1,This rambunctiously dark and anti-historical comedy from Australian playwright Tony McNamara has returned in brilliant style.
The Great,1,The series is enormously enjoyable as comedy -- and as an assault on the pieties of the period piece.
The Great,1,Huzzah.
The Great,1,One could argue the second shot of vodka always goes down smoother. The same can be said for season two of The Great.
The Great,1,"There's a whole cast of people you get comfortable with. it works, just not at that top level."
The Great,1,"From Tony McNamara, the co-writer of The Favourite, it's as bawdy, profane, and thoroughly enjoyable as ever."
The Great,1,"Huzzah! The Great is back with a great, big season that thrills and delights in a myriad of ways."
The Great,1,"A tonal marvel as usual, The Great has returned in even finer form."
The Great,1,"Mind-boggling anachronistic, The Great is, at the very least, an original."
The Great,1,It's a place of elegance and rot and backstabbing and -- if all goes to plan -- maybe even a little hope. Keeping all these things constantly front of mind and close to heart is what makes The Great worth returning to again and again.
The Great,1,"The Great is funnier than ever, bolstered by clever, tongue-in-cheek dialogue, solid writing and stunning cinematography."
The Great,1,"That doubling-down on ahistorical fun works again in The Great Season 2, but the cheekiness of now being ""entirely untrue"" brings the show dangerously close to wearing out its welcome."
The Great,1,"It may not be exactly true, in other words, but neither is it untrue. It's a riot, in every way imaginable and a lot of fun. And for that let us say huzzah!"
The Great,1,While season 2 does feel a bit static -- a successful formula inevitably becomes formulaic -- [creator Tony McNamara] does have many fertile places to go.
The Great,1,"In Season 2, The Great is as delightful as its characters are dysfunctional. Long may it reign."
The Great,1,"Season two of The Great is even stronger than season one, with better character beats and a greater reliance on humor."
The Great,1,"The Great is a show perpetually hanging on a precipice of its own making, although it's astoundingly good at hiding how hard it works to keep its balance."
The Great,1,"The series is a strange, funny, ridiculous, trundling carnival of ideas, genres, and characters. It is great in both size and quality -- ambitious, reckless, and always a joy."
The Great,1,"The second season of The Great delivers even more returns than the first season promised. Allow McNamara and his players to rewrite all of history. It will be hornier, funnier, and much better to look back upon."
The Great,1,"These are the best kinds of shows, the ones that blend genres to give you something that should be confusing but ultimately turns out surprisingly satisfying in the greatest of ways."
The Great,1,"Every single thing that you love about season one... brought to a whole new level. The humor, heart, and performances are amazing. Some slow episodes but overall, fantastic."
The Great,1,"There are still plenty of thrilling zingers and visuals, but The Great blossoms into a show with a big heart and, inevitably, heartbreak for its protagonists and viewers."
Solar Opposites,1,This season settles into its own fandom a little too much but still has plenty of surprises and a shake-up in the narrative.
Solar Opposites,1,Solar Opposites Season 3 gives fans more of the humor that they know and love while fully embracing the story of the wall.
Solar Opposites,1,Season three of 'Solar Opposites' builds upon the strong foundation of its first two seasons. Anyone who loved the previous seasons will be fully on board with 'Solar Opposites' as it continues to evolve and challenge its characters and storytelling.
Solar Opposites,1,"The Hulu original returns for a third season, hoping to build on its earlier achievements with another darkly hilarious batch of episodes, brimming with pop-culture references, meta-commentary, and intricate tangents."
Solar Opposites,1,"The new season of the Hulu comedy is bright, bold, and, frankly, bananas in the best way."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"This hugely compelling American documentary series begins with the story of the fatal swatting of an unsuspecting man in Wichita, Kansas."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",0,While all of the subjects covered in the six episodes sound very interesting a lot of the oomph is taken out of them due to the repetitive and drawn out nature of each.
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"Viewers not as familiar with these online trends will find it both interesting and harrowing. Meanwhile, it also offers some important safety reminders for those who are actively engaging with others online."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"It's not about causing social paralysis, it's about building a future where online communities can foster better social networks."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",1,"Ready yourself a bit... so you can deal with the fact that awful people can cause a lot of major problems online. But it’s still informative, even if it treats these cases with a bit too much of a sensationalistic bent."
The Defiant Ones,1,All about pushing ahead of the game... The brilliant first episode was full of eureka moments.
The Defiant Ones,1,"The Defiant Ones is witty, polished, grand in scale, ambition and budget, while remaining totally engrossing. The other music docs may as well give up now."
